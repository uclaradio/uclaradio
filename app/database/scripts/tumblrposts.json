    "title": "Not a Bad Place to End Up: Hundley Waits to Day 3 to be Selected by the Pack",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003eBy Josh Naftulin     \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e     We all know about Brett Hundley by now around Westwood.  That is, unless you’ve been living under a rock while attending UCLA or following PAC-12 football during the past few years.  His leadership and good character were unquestionable, but as the 2015 NFL Draft approached more GMs and scouts appeared to be criticizing his ability to transition to being a starting quarterback at the next level.  I of course thought my personal prediction that Hundley wouldn’t stay undrafted past the second day of the draft was a sure thing, but I’m biased because I’ve seen him develop over his college career.\n\nAnd that’s why I’m overjoyed Hundley was forced to endure the pain of not being selected until the 5th round.  When the Green Bay Packers made him the No. 166 pick in the draft, I could feel a little smile find its way to my face.  I immediately saw this as the perfect situation for Brett, and after discovering that the Packers traded to move up nineteen spots to select him, I honestly think that Director of Pro Personnel Eliot Wolf was smart to move up to nab the athletic quarterback.          Being able to learn from and develop behind a guaranteed future Hall of Famer in Aaron Rodgers will allow Hundley to harness his skills at the next level while not being thrust into a starting role.  Green Bay had already addressed its more pressing needs in the draft, and made an incredibly smart move to shuffle a late 7th-round draft pick elsewhere in order to seize what might just end up the greatest mid/late-round QB steal since Tom Brady.\n\nThere’s no need to address his stats or intangibles in this article.  Hundley certainly has the look of a NFL starting quarterback and the right head for the job, and that is why I think several GMs and personnel scouts throughout the league will be smacking themselves in the head years from now for letting Brett slip into Round 5.                    There’s literally no better football atmosphere to witness than the one at Lambeau Field, and I’m sure Hundley will find himself at home as the next Bruin (drafted since Johnathan Franklin) for Cheese Heads to cheer for.  While Brett will likely have to wait for a while to receive his chance to lead a NFL team, he’ll have an excellent chance to become what many doubted he can be.  With that immense chip on his shoulder from having to wait so long to receive that fateful phone call, Brett Hundley will definitely work to show the Packers front office and fan base his appreciation for their belief in him.  Knowing how hard Hundley will continue to work to prove himself now that he had so many quarterback-needy teams pass him up, I’ll certainly be cheering for Hundley at the next level and hope he’ll have a chance at some point down the road to prove himself as a starter.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003eBy John Tyler Osborn\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt 98-98 going into overtime, this Warriors vs. Cavaliers series looked like it was going to be an instant classic. With Curry’s sharp-shooting and tenacious squad against LeBron, his sidekick Kyrie and a supporting cast of trade-offs they got for pennies on the dollar. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009But still, LeBron and his Team of Misfit Toys were almost able to steal Game 1 in Oakland. The 4\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e Quarter was a teeter-totter of scoring runs for both teams and the excitement it generated had fans like me ecstatic to watch it continue into overtime.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Boy was I completely wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The overtime was all Warriors from the tip-off, LeBron went 1-10 in the 4\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e quarter and he scored the only basket for the Cavaliers in a superfluous layup attempt after the Warriors victory was already sealed in an envelope with Riley Curry’s stamp of approval. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The Warriors defense completely shut down the Cavaliers with their aggressive, small-ball defense able to cause turnovers and no uncontested shots for the Cavs. That’s also not the only thing the Warriors shut down though.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009With two minutes left in overtime, Kyrie Irving was driving to the basket and collapsed as he tried to cut back. He grabbed his knee as he got up and hobbled to the locker room following a David Blatt timeout. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009According to sources, Irving has a fractured knee cap and will be having season ending surgery, making him officially out for the playoffs now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009So, what does this all mean for the Cavs? Many analysts already predicted that the Warriors would win the series with a (somewhat) healthy Kyrie anyway. Is the series already over for the Cavs?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009I’ll say this on the matter, if LeBron can somehow put the whole team on his back and slug out four wins, or if JR Smith scores 60 3-pointers in the series, or if Dellavedova KO’s Curry and Thompson in one punch, than the series is already over.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009At least we’ll have a fun Riley Curry press conference at the end of it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009So that’s pretty nice.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Forced Rivalries and American Soccer",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003eBy Cole Frost\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2018, Major League Soccer will once again have two teams in Los Angeles. Currently, this team (often somewhat mockingly called “Los Angeles 2”) is being sort-of officially called the Los Angeles Football Club, LAFC. As of now, they are discussing with Los Angeles locals regarding the official name, colors, and crest of the club.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn Monday, May 18, however, this club took a major step towards its start in MLS by announcing that its stadium would be placed at the current site of the Los Angeles Sports Arena. The stadium is set to seat 22,000 and cost $250 million (and is privately financed). The stadium location is significant because it is so close to downtown LA (the Galaxy’s location in Carson has been criticized for being too far from downtown). The owners are clearly committed and the stadium announcement is an exciting one for the league.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, the announcement has been accompanied by one of the more frustrating aspects of MLS as an organization: artificially manufactured rivalries. Rivalries are a great way to drum up media attention, drive viewership, and create die-hard fans. The NFL benefits rather heavily from the NFC East hatred, the MLB craves interleague rivalries, and even international soccer salivates over classic rivalries like the Old Firm between Celtic and Rangers in Scotland. These rivalries are storied and have years of history, and MLS, as a newer league, would love to have a rivalry that comes close to the level of any other significant major sports rivalry. Sometimes, there are hints that these rivalries exist: The Galaxy and San Jose hate each other (The California Clasico). Portland and Seattle both have great fan support and their rivalry is budding. DC United and New York Red Bull have a long history dating back to when Red Bull was Metrostar. However, MLS spends too much time trying to create other rivalries that simply do not exist, including ones with teams that do not yet exist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost of these forced rivalries are regional (LA Galaxy and LAFC or Red Bull and NYCFC). However, some of the rivalries are formed on the most trivial connections between clubs. NYCFC and Orlando were pitted as rivals simply because they are both expansion clubs who joined the league at the same time. Realistically, that type of rivalry will die out quickly and just makes the league look desperate. However, even the regional rivalries should not be forced. At some point in the future, I hope to see someone in an LA Galaxy jersey exemplify the sort of pure hatred for someone in an LAFC (or whatever they end up being called) jersey as someone in a Red Sox jersey would show for a Yankees fan or an Evertonian would show his Merseyside counterpart. But, for now, it is ridiculous to picture a nameless team with no players, crest, or even colors as a rival to the team that has won 5 of the 19 titles in MLS history. \u003c/p\u003e",

Be it a sport, a game, a film, or a band. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t born early enough to be a contemporary of the period in which Sleater-Kinney was taking colleges across North America by storm, giving the neglected a voice they connected to so naturally and effortlessly. I walked into the 75 year old Hollywood Palladium as Fred Armisen was singing his last song as his alter-ego Ian Rubbish. I wandered through the thick smell of history at the venue, a smell that was an effortless mix of worn out carpets, lukewarm beer spilled on the floors and the mild odour of a generic air freshener blowing through the central air conditioning system of the venue. An enthusiastic pair of girls volunteering for Planned Parenthood, an organisation Sleater-Kinney has been collaborating with throughout their North American tour, handed me a condom and a pamphlet to keep me informed on how to stay protected. A perfect fit for both parties involved, especially because of the resemblance in their distinct messages as a band and an organisation. Whenever I go to a venue i\u0026rsquo;ve never been to before I enjoy looking at the ventilation ducts. I look at the decay of paint around the ducts and try and imagine all the sonic energies that have echoed through the structural integrity of that building. Be it an EDM night, or a Mastodon gig; I always try and make myself believe that some sense of liberation flows through those ducts at every single event. Thankfully, that liberating stimulus flowed through me; right into those ducts at that night.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2908\" data-orig-height=\"2908\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/15d1817e1601399b3998ed124ff4899f/tumblr_inline_nny042B5ye1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-width=\"2908\" data-orig-height=\"2908\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs I sipped my ice cold and overpriced beer and looked around to see who i\u0026rsquo;d have to talk to for getting into the photo pit; Kim Gordon and Bill Nace, also known as Body/Head took the stage. Having seen them a couple of times before, I was very eager to see if their small and intimate sound bath would translate to a venue of this scale, and whether it would gain what it would loses from it\u0026rsquo;s intimacy in a sense of sonic scale. As the sounds they were releasing into the room could conventionally be described as experimental or noise oriented; there was some extent of alienation oozing out of the audience; but that thankfully did no harm to the raw connection that cements the on stage power-duo relationship between Nace and Gordon. Much like the prime of Sonic Youth, Body/Head\u0026rsquo;s sounds feed on the emotional outpour of Gordon\u0026rsquo;s sonic style. She\u0026rsquo;s still the uncontrollably raw performer she always was, and it\u0026rsquo;s a great delight to see her with an on stage partner that she feels so comfortable with. As they were playing the first few notes of the third song, I was allowed into the photo pit alongside a few other people who had cameras with lenses bigger than their arms. \u0026ldquo;Self-consciousness inflicted through an inferiority complex caused by size differences, how fitting for such a sexually aware show\u0026rdquo; I thought to myself as I attempted to both let go of the feeling of inferiority and enjoy being that close to such raw energy exhuming from two performers, whilst simultaneously trying to make sure I was capturing adequate pictures to accomplish the task I was given. What a fabulous metaphor for the \u0026ldquo;music business\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2176\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/33647717a39bb4cc9a4bd62e1bf583e0/tumblr_inline_nny09hXJc01qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2176\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eGordon threw her guitar around the stage and crawled back to the microphone to vocalise her energy as Nace played a few last notes to round out their fourth or fifth track while me and the rest of the folk with big cameras were asked to leave the pit as we had reached the end of the time during which we were allowed to take pictures. I paid yet another 11 dollars for a beer as the sound engineer put Andy Stott\u0026rsquo;s Faith In Strangers on the sound system while the stage crew started making the final arrangements \u0026amp; last minute tunings for Sleater-Kinney\u0026rsquo;s set.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2176\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a58da301a5ee48a486d413bccd897d76/tumblr_inline_nny09u9roy1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2176\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen it all went dark, and Sleater-Kinney took the stage. Fuelled by the first few deep chords of their cut Price Tag from the sublime No Cities To Love, the raw energy of the trio, joined by guitarist Katie Harkin of Sky Larkin, took over the room. With their energy now more relevant than ever, they powered their way through the first two tracks before taking a minute to talk with the audience. As they started playing Turn It On, I was let inside the photo pit and was allowed to shoot them up close for 3 songs, a period that felt both unbearably short and an eternity. It is fascinating to see the clash \u0026amp; harmony of energies between Tucker and Brownstein, as Corin\u0026rsquo;s energy is vividly present yet so sensitive that she can easily feel disrupted by a drunken member of the audience, whereas Carrie is just a powerhouse, with an impenetrably raw style and stage presence that you can\u0026rsquo;t help but get caught up in. Janet Weiss\u0026rsquo;s drumming acts as the core of power for the band, a force that Brownstein transforms into a resonant wave of stimulus that gets passed on to Tucker\u0026rsquo;s powerful vocals and bangs on the eardrums of the audience. It was a strange feeling to be capturing pictures of such a powerful trio so close. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eOnly a band with the caliber of Sleater-Kinney can force it\u0026rsquo;s audience to be swept away into a stream of awareness that demands a conscious surrender; a surrender that will allow whoever feels the need to find a voice to do just that. With such a broad array of topics to protest against, Brownstein and Co. act as the ring bearers of awareness in an age where many feel like they have to kill or surrender to an idol to feel like they have a voice, or a community. The experience of being in the presence of such skilled performers caused a thrill that could be felt throughout the room. The band made their way through new and old songs like A New Wave, Rollercoaster, Surface Envy and and Jumpers before briefly exiting the stage only to come back for an encore that included their classics One More Hour and Dig Me Out, with The Woods\u0026rsquo; Modern Girl acting as the climax and final track of a perfect set. Harkin\u0026rsquo;s strumming was a force to be reckoned with throughout the night as she added a depth and rhythm to the Sleater-Kinney sound when a trio may not have had the same effect. It was a delight to see how well she gelled in with Weiss, Tucker and Brownstein to prove that a touring member with the right energy can have a monumental effect on a band\u0026rsquo;s performance.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eAs I exited the Palladium and wandered into Sunset Boulevard for a walk back to my car, I had a brief chance to reflect on the magnificent show I had just seen. The reason Sleater-Kinney is more relevant as a band than ever is because the continuous disconnection in society, particularly in the youth, can turn into a serious obstacle for individuals trying to find a genuine voice for themselves, and Sleater-Kinney is up for the challenge of giving them one. They represent the minority as well as they represent the majority. Their energy, their sound and their lyrics give consistent fuel to go on for those who try and dig beneath the surface of everything in a search of true happiness. They are the reassuring pat in the back for a generation that has big problems getting knocked down. They are the supportive big sisters as much as they are the riot grrls. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t old enough to have my heart broken when they announced their split, but I am genuinely delighted they are back. Keep your guitars raised high and voices strong for all of us cause we need you now more than ever, girls.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3072\" data-orig-height=\"3072\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6788bc5cef17b75dc508c6c94197b305/tumblr_inline_nny0azZ6CN1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-width=\"3072\" data-orig-height=\"3072\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003ePhotos \u0026amp; Words: \u003ci\u003eHakancan Altıner\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

The Bruins were feeling confident at #3 in the country, but Stanford came out in the first game with much more to play for. By beating UCLA 6-1 in the first game, the Cardinals showed that this would not just be another easy series for the Bruins. Cardinal pitcher Brett Henewich won the game for his team, while UCLA pitcher James Kaprielian struggled to even help the Bruins as he gave up a season high amount of runs. However, if you could learn anything about Bruin baseball, it is that you should not count them out. They did just as they did with Cal the week before: came out the next game with a chip on their shoulder. In game two of the series, UCLA shut out the Cardinals 10-0. Grant Watson, a senior pitcher, came in for game 2 and brought the Bruins to victory at Stanford by throwing 6 shutout innings. Now, everything came down to game 3. Both teams had something to prove, but the Bruins pulled away with the series victory by throwing in relief pitchers. Freshman pitcher Griffin Canning lasted for a little over five innings and only gave up two runs. However, senior pitcher David Berg came in for relief to bring the Bruins a 9-3 victory over Stanford in that last game. With good pitching, especially off the bench, the Bruins put out great offense and return to LA feeling good with another series victory under their belt. If one has anything to learn from the last two series for Bruins baseball, it would be that we need to balance the performance of our pitching core and see healthier, more reliable output from the offense. \u003c/p\u003e",

Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s a complete change of style, A La Radiohead. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s a change of scale, maybe adding a full blown orchestra, or a brass section. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s scaling down and getting more intimate. A very rare thing for a band to do is however, to become more introverted and extroverted at the same time; to have a very clear idea of what the core of the band\u0026rsquo;s soul comes from, and still be open to add and explore new sounds. And that is the exact reason why Spoon comes forward as one of the most unique and accomplished rock bands of our time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Austin natives followed their performance at The Wiltern by playing the the inaugural show of the Teragram Ballroom, located just between Koreatown and Downtown Los Angeles, to an intimate and energetic crowd. The opening band, Sweet Spirit (also of Austin,TX) provided a jump start to the evening, with a thick and energetic ensemble performance, climaxing with Britt Daniel of Spoon joining them for their final song of the evening. Although they encountered sound issues at several moments, Sweet Spirit displayed the energy and spirit of a promising ensemble, one that surely convinced the audience to keep an eye out for their future works.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"4608\" data-orig-height=\"3072\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/21ed1dd520e4502a6871a0ad286fc344/tumblr_inline_npakra2Fi31qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4608\" data-orig-height=\"3072\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter a short set change allowing everyone to visit the water closet and get a refill on their IPA\u0026rsquo;s; the lights went dark, and Spoon took the stage. The electrifying stage presence of the band started to ooze out with the first few notes of Rainy Taxi from last year\u0026rsquo;s phenomenal They Want My Soul. As the band powered their way through newer cuts and classics, some things became very clear.  To begin with, getting to see a band of such a caliber in such an intimate setting was a very rare opportunity. Making his way through his third decade on the stage, Britt Daniel\u0026rsquo;s performance as a frontman is more effortless and commanding than ever. He not only gracefully plays off his band members whilst being in charge of the momentum, he also delivers the lyrics with the raw energy and skill of someone who can only be described as a true rock star. Jim Eno\u0026rsquo;s drumming is more transgressive than ever, rendering both older Spoon cuts into an unpredictable sonic area, and adding a much appreciated rhythmic backbone to their newer works. It is fascinating to watch a band with so many classic cuts that remain so gracefully timeless. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"4608\" data-orig-height=\"3072\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bd08969ad16e4c588e13c10b8b531ce0/tumblr_inline_npakt0105n1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4608\" data-orig-height=\"3072\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe deeper the band moved into their setlist, playing tracks like The Ghost Of You Lingers,  Let Me Be Mine and The Beast + Dragon, Adored; making their way to a true modern masterpiece, They Want My Soul\u0026rsquo;s Inside Out. The track\u0026rsquo;s famous synth line resonated even better live, with the newest band member Alex Fischel\u0026rsquo;s keyboards swirling into a semi-loop as Jim Eno\u0026rsquo;s bass drums resonated in the ears of the audience. It is very interesting to watch the level of integration Fischel has in the core line-up of Spoon. Eno and Daniel appear to be constantly open to taking their sound to new places, exemplified by the keyboard dominant sounds from their newer works. Because of how self-aware Spoon is of their work as a band that the raw core of their work is always open to change, yet it somehow always stays familiar; which seems to be the main reason they are able to stay so relevant in their third decade as a band. An interesting metaphor for this is the one second gap they take towards the end when they play Inside Out. Always in motion, always able to stop and think; always able to stop and feel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe rest of their set included classics like I Summon You, wherein Britt Daniel breaks out his inner Dylan and shines as the classic leading man singing a guitar driven ballad. The band wrapped up their set with tracks like The Underdog and Rent I Pay, and the crowd wandered into the night; taking pictures of the \u0026ldquo;SPOON TONITE - SOLD OUT\u0026rdquo; sign outside the Teragram Ballroom and share with their social media-verse the gospel of a group of guys from Austin we know and love as Spoon. Their performance was as much planned as it was energetic, as much a ritual as it was a bash. Spoon yet again convinced me that they are one of the finest rock bands of the planet right now, and I can\u0026rsquo;t wait to hear what\u0026rsquo;s next.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"4608\" data-orig-height=\"3072\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/70563e1f8160ad5a92862af0d2e97034/tumblr_inline_npakq04qGg1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4608\" data-orig-height=\"3072\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003ePhotos \u0026amp; Words: \u003ci\u003eHakancan Altiner\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Redick poured in a playoff career-high 31 points and Paul looked great in his return, scoring 12 points and dishing out 7 assists in just 23 minutes.  Blake Griffin added 22 points (including some earth-shattering dunks on the entire state of Texas), 14 rebounds, and 4 assists while DeAndre Jordan pulled down 15 rebounds.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJames Harden led the Rockets with 25 points and 11 assists while Dwight Howard added 14 points and 14 rebounds.  But the Clippers clamped down on Houston’s complementary players, frustrating them to the point that Jason Terry was ejected in the 4\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e quarter for a blindside cheap shot on Blake Griffin.  The way that the Clippers held Harden, the NBA’s regular season leader in free throw attempts, to just 5 FTAs was a big storyline as well.  Coach Rivers praised his team’s defensive effort on Harden saying “Every time he drove, you saw our guys pulling their hands back, pulling their hands back, and they had the discipline to do that.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-height=\"501\" data-orig-width=\"282\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4cbac774200a2777d12fa5fc15c25b51/tumblr_inline_no75i9Y6kL1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"501\" data-orig-width=\"282\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e(Photo Credit: Darryn Albert)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor his part, Harden credited the Clipper defense saying in his postgame interview, “They’re a really good defensive team, especially when they get set.  We’ve just got to do a better job of moving the basketball and just being aggressive.”  Rockets coach Kevin McHale echoed these sentiments, saying, “We couldn’t get shots to go, and we didn’t have any flow.  Really James was the only guy that was making plays for us in the halfcourt.  We weren’t running, we weren’t getting stops.  We didn’t play very well.  In that third quarter, our team defense went to hell.”  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe game was yet another exhibit in the Clippers’ rapidly growing portfolio of strong two-way play in the postseason.  They finished the night shooting over 55% from the field and they won the rebounding battle by the total of 50-43.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen asked about how his hamstring held up after the game, Chris Paul replied, “I got through.  This is the point of the season where nobody is 100%.  And if I could give anything to get out there and help the team, then I wanted to do it.  It was fun to get out there and be a part of the action.”  With regard to Austin’s performance, Paul remarked “Austin was unbelievable.  I was probably his biggest cheerleader there in the 3\u003csup\u003erd\u003c/sup\u003e quarter.  He’s been working really hard and seeing him do that, it gave me a chance to rest.”  The artist known as CP3 has since remarked about his status for Game 4 saying “There’s no speculation, probable or questionable, I’m playing.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUltimately, Game 3 will be remembered for a lot of things.  A night where the Clippers got their floor general back.  A night where J.J. Redick canned every shot he looked at.  A night where Blake Griffin dunked on entire cosmos (well…another night).  And a night where the once-detested Austin Rivers caught fire, spread his wings, stepped on Houston throats, and finally earned the respect of the Clipper faithful.  We’ll see if Sunday’s Game 4 at the Staples Center (8:30 PM EST/5:30 PM PST tip-off) can top it.  \u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Album Review: Ten Thousand Fists by Disturbed (2005, Reprise/Intoxication)",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003eFirstly, unless you were born between January 1988 and December 1998, you won’t have been in high school during Ross Robinson’s golden age. If you were, you would’ve experienced the opinion-dividing powerhouse that was teenage angst mixed with metal. Most kids loved it. I loved it. And I sure as hell still love it. I’m referring here to nu-metal. Right now, I’m predicting that a surge of names are being uncontrollably flung at you. Fred Durst. Linkin Park. Maybe even Korn. Or, the question of, why is mixing hip hop and sound effects with heavy metal even being considered as a good idea? But chances are, there’s bound to be band one name where the only significance is the name. For those nu metal converts who flung themselves full pelt into the subgenre, Disturbed were exactly what they wanted. Creative synths added to thundering guitar riffs, distorted yet clean vocals, and verses that nearly resembled hip hop but were accompanied by such a heavy backdrop and distortion that it couldn’t possibly be hip hop. A following was quickly amassed and within the world of rock and metal, the name is recognizable at an ear’s prick. I use the term ‘prick’ as though it is a sharp sound. For many more it is. Average rock and metal fans claim them to be either too soft, or embody too many stereotypical teenage issues. Critics who apply pen to paper, and my friend Rob, claim that all their albums sound exactly the same. With 2005’s Ten Thousand Fists, I will dispute this.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e   The album opens with its title song. It signifies it is holding no compromises. Straight to the ruthless, brutal point. And yet there is build up. The first thing we hear is an ambient sound, something that isn’t created by a synth guitar or a pounding riff as with their first two albums, but a cold haunting sound that draws us into nothing but suspense. It lasts two seconds, then a quiet groove-based guitar riff starts playing its twanging melody. The build-up has begun. Within twenty seconds, we hear a melodic roar of David Draiman’s vocals, with a production quality that makes it far more powerful than the opening of their first two releases.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eby: Alex H\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"459\" data-orig-height=\"344\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FDs-Xc2CXasw\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"404\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ds-Xc2CXasw?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

    "title": "Show Review: Alex G @ the Echo (5/21/15)",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003eUpon entering the near empty room, The Echo was quiet when I saw three girls on stage who make up the band SLUTEVER, are cleaning up and moving off the stage. I figure I have about fifteen minutes of an intermission before the next band to come on. To the right are small booths and tables reserved for merch vendors for the band. To the left, the wall is lined with a bar and men and women are sharing drinks complacently, clad in ripped 90’s full­house dad jeans and antique sweaters. I exit through the back of the bar to get a breath of fresh air before Alex G goes on stage. The back, an even smaller space is lined with past show lineups and people clad in similar attire chain smoking on a ripped couch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"528\" data-orig-width=\"396\"\u003e\u003cimg data-orig-height=\"528\" data-orig-width=\"396\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/af972f394a8fae4c1a9d34577f3aa731/tumblr_inline_nqd1w964oO1qhakxc_540.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eA bit of loud murmuring from the inside suggests that Alex G and his band are preparing and setting up. My friend and I retreat from the couch full of lounging smokers and I wonder if they are here to see any bands or if they are just here to be seen. I walk into the now crammed and hazy thirty by thirty room full of heads. I lean up against the side of the stage close to Alex G’s rhythm guitar player. Within the minute I walk in the band is about to play and what seems like a six foot tall version of a ten year old boy introduces himself as Alex G and says about nothing else. Shortly after, the band starts off abrupt, playing recognizably a good grip of songs from his most recent album, DSU. What surprised me the most was the speed, clarity and more complex instrumentation demonstrated in this live performance in contrast with his intimate bedroom recordings on the album. Somewhere near halfway through the set a sped up, though recognizable version of one of my favorite, older Alex G songs, “Wicked Boy” is played.  Again, I am taken aback by the song’s difference from the album. The muffled, nasally and nostalgic voice of a younger Alex G is replaced by a matured one. The minimal and quasi­-electronic drumming from the album is replaced by a highly competent drummer and a very present bassist. While I’m not sure if I actually prefer the seemingly rushed and complex instrumentation of the live performance when faced with the solo bedroom recordings of Alex G, I was definitely impressed by the overall engagement with the audience and enthusiasm. Never would I have guessed that one could be so excited to sing songs that mutter, “You think you wanna die, but I watch you close your eyes, it’s alright”. Following the final song, I didn’t plan on doing much lingering due to the flocks of fans hitting the merch booth to smother the band so my friend and I split. Strangely enough, my way out was greeted by Alex and his bandmate smoking outside of the venue and I chatted for a second, not really saying much other than nervous fanboy jargon. On top of his performance being pretty good, him and his band are really friendly people and I will certainly make an effort to see them or any other Orchid Tapes band again.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"528\" data-orig-width=\"396\"\u003e\u003cimg data-orig-height=\"528\" data-orig-width=\"396\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/77f5a26ecd11aa8860b21139d437bbbf/tumblr_inline_nqd1wdJuuf1qhakxc_540.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWords \u0026amp; Photos by: \u003ci\u003eJake Stutz\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Show Review: Nick Offerman \u0026 Megan Mullally - Summer of 69: No Apostrophe @ The Wiltern, 5/21/2015",
    "content": "\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"1080\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s often difficult to have any form of secrecy in a relationship between two celebrities. Every single detail of the relationship just spills out to the public, be it significant, insignificant, real, or fake; and it is very easy for the the fans to have a strong opinion on the aforementioned relationship. And as a very rare example, the lengths that Megan Mulally \u0026amp; Nick Offerman go to in order to disclose the genuineness of their relationship actually formed the core force underlying their public image as a comedy duo.  \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eOut of respect for their no-photo policy, I will take the hint and not disclose the details of the show at full length, but rather reflect on my impressions. It is a very challenging task to maintain momentum in a show that transitions between music and comedy, particularly if the show includes interactions with the audience, making it inherently off-beat. Offerman\u0026rsquo;s leg injury and one member of the audience who insisted on doing god knows what on his phone, in the front row nonetheless, couldn\u0026rsquo;t keep the show from being eclectic yet warm, organised yet spontaneous. Most of the body of work forming Summer of 69: No Apostrophe consists of the sexual nature of the relationship between the two performers. Memories, bizarre experiences and a series of recollections of unorthodox sex positions prove that with the right amount of genuineness and good rhetoric, it is actually possible to form a 2 hour set that consists of dick jokes. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eOfferman and Mullaly, respectively of Will \u0026amp; Grace and Parks and Recreation fame, are both similar and different than their characters Ron Swanson and Karen Walker in many ways. The raw and down to earth personality of Swanson echoes through Offerman\u0026rsquo;s delivery, whereas Mullally expertly transfers Karen Walker\u0026rsquo;s inherent energy to glamorise stories into a hilarious way of sugarcoating her memories, making the show feel fresh yet familiar. As it is normal for a comedy act to have points of lost momentum, it is not often that the cause of this hitch in tempo is a member of the audience. As I have come to deeply respect a performer\u0026rsquo;s choice to keep a performance cellphone free, it feels mind-boggling to see what lengths some members of the audience go to just check their phones. In this particular occasion, a gentleman in the front row who personally got warned by Offerman on three separate occasions, somehow found the shamelessness in himself to actually boo the show and got himself kicked out of the room. For a performer to be kicking out a member of the audience is not something that can always be seen as a way of thinking that can be empathised with, but Offerman\u0026rsquo;s stance on this occasion felt both justified and necessary. It was quite interesting to observe two performers perform a solid two hour set of below the belt jokes and then outclass an uncivilised member of the audience with such grace. I sincerely hope as the use of technology begins to get more and more instinctual to us, we will somehow rediscover a way to show a performance the respect it deserves and demands.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eAll in all, Summer Of 69: No Apostrophe delivered exactly what it promised, two hours of sensual intimacy flowing through The Wiltern resulting in a hilarious and satisfying climax. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- \u003ci\u003eHakancan Altiner\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Fall(?) of Brady",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003eBy J.T. Osborn\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn February 1, 2015, Tom Brady won Super Bowl XLIX and solidified himself as possibly the greatest quarterback of this generation if not ever.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009On May 5, 2015, a report came out that may jeopardize that assumption. Ted Wells’ report on the Deflategate scandal stated that it’s “more probable than not” that Tom Brady was likely aware of the purposeful deflating of game balls for the AFC Championship game against Indianapolis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Following the Championship game, officials and reports came out claiming that a vast majority of the Patriots’ game balls used were under-deflated beyond the legal playing limit as designated by the NFL. Immediately, Commissioner Goodell responded with an investigation, hiring Ted Wells to lead the investigation and find out who was responsible for the deflations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Rumors began swirling blaming Tom Brady, locker attendant Jim McNally, and even Bill Belichick for being responsible of such treachery. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Now, it’s official…kind of. McNally is labeled to have deflated the balls and Brady is being (sort of) labeled as (more probable than not) the evil mastermind behind it all. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009So what exactly does this all mean for Brady’s legacy? I’m glad I asked. Brady has never had the popularity his arch rival and friend Peyton Manning has had. Manning comes off as intelligent, witty, funny, likeable, and someone you’d want to share a beer with to both fans and media alike. Brady however, has come off as snotty, arrogant, and whiny to the pigskin population. Manning gains a lot of ground in the legacy department simply because he’s been more likeable than Brady, because let’s face it: the greatest player of this generation comes down to between these two.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009It’s not entirely fair that people judge Brady the way they do and that Manning will always be seen more favorably simply because he was more likeable during his time in the NFL.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009But Brady has always had two things going for him against Manning: Super Bowls and head-to-head victories: four Super Bowl victories compared to Manning’s one and an 11-5 record head-to-head. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Now, Tom Brady has another distinction: suspended (probable) cheater. To what extent do under-deflated balls help Tom Brady? I don’t know. Has Tom Brady been doing this for a while? I don’t know. Will this hurt Brady’s legacy? Yes, I do know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009It’s official that Tom Brady will be suspended for an unknown amount of time during the 2016 season. The duration of the punishment should come out next week and I’m sure Brady will appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Still, the blemish will be there. The report will always be tied to his name. In the United States Justice System you may be innocent until proven guilty, but in the sports world and to the fans, it doesn’t matter. That ‘what if’ will always be there, and the Internet generation never forgets, just ask Barry Bonds. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Dammit Brady, you had it all wrapped up and you blew it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Long live Manning, the fair-playing, savvy quarterback that will go down as the best of our generation. \u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cblockquote\u003eHere at UCLA Radio, we love Of Montreal. In case you missed \u003ca href=\"http://uclaradio.tumblr.com/post/116431934255/show-review-of-montreal-the-regent-3-22-15\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEddie’s review of their show\u003c/a\u003e at the Regent in March, we got another throwback review for you today. Get ready to transport thyself back to the 22nd of March! \u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"375\" data-orig-width=\"500\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ff1e4de6632e0c3c9b35f3784705b17c/tumblr_inline_nnjqcxmxrm1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"375\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf Montreal played Sunday night (3/22/15) at the Regent Theatre in Los Angeles, and, without failing to be critical, it was probably the best show I’ve ever seen.  Of course, Of Montreal always puts on a phenomenal show; their recent tour, however, is especially fun and goofy.  As promised at the beginning of the show  by a masked MC who made a deal with the devil himself: if we all, collectively, have the greatest night of our lives, Of Montreal will be awarded with the power to alter reality for an hour- or as it turns out, an hour and a half.    \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eMusically, the band was on top as ever.  They played a 100 minute set which included their newest hits, such as those of their most recent album, Aurelate Gloom.  They also stretched back into the Of Montreal canon to play their earlier classics: hits like ‘Wraith Pinned to the Mist and Other Games’, which always induces a lovely and bouncy crowd response.  Of course, part of the beauty of a live show is how the music diverges from the records we know and love. Kevin Barnes and the band were not afraid to make those diversions, often times illiciting a huge crowd response.  When Barnes extended a note into what is normally a silent pause, for example, the crowd went wild with cheers and clapping. An Of Montreal show, however, goes well beyond the music.  As in past shows, the band was frequently joined on stage by costumed performers who would present visually stimulating scenes or use their bodies and props to augment the already interesting light show.  Masked figures use large white circles to capture picture from the projector: skulls, faces, sperm and eggs, and much more pop off the back wall and onto the stage in these placards.  As if these masked performers weren’t enough to capture the imagination- which they were- performers also came out in much more vibrant costumes.  One should mention the numerous masked brides, one of which engaged in fabulously simulated sex with the guitarist, who, although riding the brides pelvis with both legs in the air, never ceased playing. My personal favorite scene, however, involved two large breasted dogs in American flag jumpers.  They first treated to audience to a boxing match, before begining a bizarre strip tease.  The crowd going wild, the dogs finally stripped to their waists, revealing comically large foam breasts which they showed off to the audience. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNo doubt, however, the star of the show was Kevin Barnes himself.  It’s not often that the main singer and guitarist for a band finds his way off stage multiple times through out the show, but it was necessary for Barnes to manage his multiple outfit changes.  Though each outfit is worth a mention, it was what he wore to finish the show that captures best the fun, party spirit of the concert.  After called for an encore, Barnes returned to the stage wearing nothing but short white shorts and a neck scarf, flaunting his lean torso for the benefit of the audience.  Other entrances were even more spectacular, such as when, after a outfit change, Barnes was reintroduced as the center piece of an altar of sorts- a combination of actors draped in white and extraordinary projections. In a word, the concert was sublime.  Multiple other nuances of the concert going experience as well as those described in depth above came together for a truly enjoyable concert going experience.  The audience, for example, seemed light-hearted, jovial, and interested in having a good time.  The merchandise table, located on The Regent’s balconies which afford a more than acceptable view without the crowds, was selling wares which included tape cassettes and underwear, along with the usual garb.  Feathers, shot into the audience, added to the show’s relaxed yet mystical atmosphere, allowing for bizarre breaks such as the country feminist anthem played during one of Barnes’s changes.  There are more sights and sounds at an Of Montreal concert than can be put into a measly review such as this one; this critic’s advice is that when Of Montreal plays near you, you ought never to fail in attending.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eReview by Sheehan and photo by Eddie \u003c/p\u003e",

Thundercat’s solo endeavors consist of two albums, each of which was commended for Bruner’s dexterous bass work and unique jazz-fusion soundscapes.  If Friday’s performance is anything like his previous live appearances, the soulful and dance-worthy nature of Thundercat’s music should translate well on stage, complete with all the extended cuts and improvised jams that make for a definitive jazz show. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKnowing how tightly knit the artists under the Brainfeeder label are, it comes as no surprise that Teebs will open up for the headliner right after a student performance which is yet to be announced.  Teebs is an LA visual artist and DJ who puts together some of the more ethereal and well balanced beats and textures in the electronic scene today.  This producer is more adept at creating mellow moods than danceable grooves, but I anticipate that he’ll serve as an exceptional opening act nonetheless.  Teebs alone would justify the price of admission, but you can see both of these acts for roughly $25-$35, or absolutely \u003cb\u003eFREE\u003c/b\u003e if you’re a UCLA student.

    "title": "Show Review: An Evening with David Sedaris @ Royce Hall at UCLA (5/5/15)",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003eThere are a few things you can expect to encounter every year: America’s love for irrational salience issues, awkward family gatherings, the strange and unlikely generosity of strangers, and David Sedaris making his yearly rounds to point out the humor of it all.  Before he was selling out venues and touring universities, the author/comedian first emerged in the early 90’s with his breakthrough piece, “SantaLand Diaries”\u0026ndash; a stark and self-deprecating essay about his time working as an elf in a Macy’s department store.  His work has remained in a similar vein as this debut, consisting of nine autobiographical short story compilations since.  His books have garnered widespread acclaim by earning Sedaris numerous awards, and making him a regular in the bestseller lists. But what Sedaris is really known for by the average reader, is his knack for fleshing out the seemingly mundane, and endowing it with his beloved brand of wry, sardonic humor.  Last Tuesday, our very own Royce Hall received nothing short of that.  Even though its been over two years since the release of his last book, \u003ci\u003eLet’s Explore Diabetes with Owls\u003c/i\u003e,\u003ci\u003e \u003c/i\u003eSedaris has been working relentlessly in between tour dates composing one essay after another, or at the very least, keeping his diary filled with outrageous musings.  English majors, literature buffs, and casual readers such as myself were treated to various readings of new material for a solid, and thoroughly entertaining ninety minutes. Shortly after taking the stage, David opened with a slightly different piece, one that reads from the perspective of a woman who is appalled upon noticing her reflection in a public art installation.  The story is cute and lighthearted\u0026ndash; in other words, good for loosening up a crowd with high expectations.  However, this opener didn’t particularly move me as much as his other pieces have in the past.  While it was an entertaining essay, Sedaris has proven that his forte lies in his ability to express really dark humor through his personal experiences.  However, this safe opener was completely made up for during the following two pieces, “Calypso” and “Spa Music.”  The former takes many turns, going from the author’s medical misadventures, to having a tumor removed by a fan, and finally feeding said tumor to a snapping turtle.  “Spa Music” on the other hand focuses solely on his younger brother\u0026ndash; a goodhearted guy, but also the type that spends way too much time reading 9/11 conspiracy theories. Both stories were lengthy, but adroit at keeping the audience’s interest.  The essays were written in typical Sedaris fashion, yet perfectly balanced with staggering unpredictability. David closed off the evening by sharing a series of selected entries from his diary.  I almost feel as if this portion was presented in direct response to people like myself that criticized the overt lightheartedness of the opener.  Specifically, these selections were appropriately offensive and unapologetically grim.  The entries ranged from a couple of lines to about a dozen sentences, and covered everything from a fan expressing his rape fantasy, to (hypothetically) getting a blowjob from a baby. \u003cbr/\u003eThe evening peaked with his personal essays, and didn’t let up until Sedaris finally walked away from the podium.  The promise of laughing really hard is a good enough selling point for fans, but for me, I’m also very intrigued by the honesty and self-awareness expressed in the midst of all the comedy.  After all, the author himself made reference to how ridiculous it is that we paid to watch a guy read on stage.  However, I feel as if attending “An Evening with David Sedaris” is much more than that. Aside from a few words carried through David’s characteristic effeminate voice, the experience also lies in being surrounded by fellow fans, and enveloped in their awkward, snorting laughs.  At times, my biggest laughs came not from the joke itself, but from listening to the people around cackle and relate profoundly to some bit about prophetic driftwood.  David Sedaris’ essays seldom peak with life-changing events and overarching morals.  Instead, he proves time and time again that there’s hilarity, and sometimes even poetry, to the most average of experiences.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"335\" data-orig-width=\"500\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/28742267621b2ace754dc98b7cb2d35f/tumblr_inline_nomimtWWqg1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"335\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWords: \u003ci\u003eDouglas Gil\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Lovedrug was formed in Canton, Ohio in 2001. Frontman Michael Shepherd came up with the name “Lovedrug” for his band because he initially dropped music to enroll in film school, but his “first ‘love’ of the music medium ‘dragged’ him back,” thus the word “lovedrug” is a loose past participle. The ambiguous and multiple meanings of the name of the band provide an opportunity for listeners to think of their own interpretation. Upon first look at the sticker, “pretend your alive” paired with “lovedrug” most obviously seems like an implication that love is a drug that kills you. The specific song “Pretend You’re Alive” is a somewhat dark song that includes elements of nature, seasons, and spirit while talking about trying to let go and enjoy life even during a mental breakdown. The band Lovedrug recently celebrated its ten-year anniversary by re-releasing their debut LP \u003ci\u003ePretend You’re Alive\u003c/i\u003e along with feature demos, live recordings, and unreleased songs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFind out more about Lovedrug at their website: \u003ca href=\"http://www.lovedrugmusic.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.lovedrugmusic.com\u003c/a\u003e!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith much LOVE,\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElizabeth\u003c/p\u003e",

Five different players scored as twenty-one players got valuable tournament experience for the undefeated Bruins. The Bruins’ next game is slated for Friday, November 21, as the defending national champions will take on Harvard at Drake Stadium at 8:00 p.m. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003eMen’s soccer continued the weekend’s success by defeating San Diego State 2-1 on Sunday at Drake. In what can only be called an incredibly professional performance from the Bruins, the UCLA team was a class above the Aztecs for the first 89 minutes of the game. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"Apple-tab-span\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003eOn a day where the team was honoring six seniors, including senior Earl Edwards, Jr., and star midfielder Leo Stolz, Leo stole the show. It became clear just how much the team would miss Leo next year when he showed incredible composure and skill on the ball nearly every time he touched it. Stolz benefited from a free-flowing formation and, despite playing a very direct San Diego State team, found ways to get the ball to his feet in space to avoid being bypassed by a team who showed no real desire to keep any possession within the midfield. The Aztecs placed 6’5” Senior Henrik Synnes up top and consistently looked to play directly to the tall target man. For a short time, it looked as though their direct strategy would work, as UCLA struggled to win the second ball. Synnes’ strike-partner hit the bar in the 22nd minute, and UCLA’s Michael Amick followed with a heroic headed save to keep the scores level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"Apple-tab-span\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003eThe first thirty minutes failed to produce a real chance for UCLA, who struggled at first to cope with SDSU’s direct style of play. However, the game opened up after Leo Stolz picked a goal from very little by beating the goalie near post during the 31st minute. The goal was met with a small bit of controversy, as a few Aztec players seemed to appeal for a handball after UCLA won the ball at midfield in the move that started the goal; however, the ref appeared to make the correct call in dismissing the appeals. UCLA’s Nico Gonzalez had the best chance of the last 15 minutes of the first half to double the lead, after finding himself in alone on the keeper but being unable to round the Aztec shot-stopper. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"Apple-tab-span\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003eFreshman forward Abu Danladi started the second half, giving UCLA an extra spark. San Diego State, in need of a goal, got absolutely nothing going forward to start the second half. UCLA even struck the bar at the 63rd minute. At the 68th minute, San Diego State’s Jeff Rhodes received a yellow card for a harsh challenge on UCLA’s Felix Vobejda, who had been exploiting the left side of the Aztec defense along with fellow German Leo Stolz. Soon after, Danladi would double the lead with a cool finish off of a breakaway. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"Apple-tab-span\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003eAt the 85th minute, with SDSU still posing no real threat, UCLA gave reserves a run out. A lapse in concentration gave SDSU a goal with 18 seconds left in the game, but a simple clearance from UCLA off of the kickoff ended the game and saw the Bruins clinch a 2-1 win that was never really under threat. The team were then greeted by news today that they had received the second overall seed for the Men’s NCAA tournament, which commences this week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"Apple-tab-span\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003eThe Men’s team will face either San Diego or Cal State Fullerton in their first tournament game, which will take place on Sunday, November 23rd at 7:00 p.m. The Bruins, who are the tournament’s second overall seed, lost 1-0 away to San Diego earlier this year. The two UCLA soccer programs stand in a unique position, with both the Men’s and Women’s programs having a shot at titles this year, a rare feat that was mostly achieved by the University of Connecticut basketball teams in 2013-2014. \u003c/p\u003e",

Starting off as a comedy intern has really made me see how much of comedy I want to implement on my own radio show.

That album is just so unique and unlike Devendra’s ever done before, but it just sounds so old-school (he found an old 4-track Tascam tape recorder in a pawn shop to give it that old-school, distorted, home recording sound) and GREAT. If you’re ever feeling like crap about a break-up or something, or even if you’re feeling great with whoever you’re with or not with at the moment, give it a listen. I swear. The songs make for great makeout music as well if you disregard the lyrics (but then again, a good amount of Devendra’s discography is like that).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRecommended Tracks from Devendra Banhart:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e“Your fine Petting Duck”\u003cbr/\u003e“The Ballad of Keenan Milton”\u003cbr/\u003e“Daniel”\u003c/p\u003e",

This unique feature is basically the main component of the shoegaze genre and later became transformed into dream-pop by musicians who owe their inspiration to these pioneering rockers.

The Bruins, who came into the game after a tough weekend in Northern California saw them lose to Berkeley and draw Stanford, kept Washington in check during the second half, securing a 2-1 win. After a first ten minutes where both teams really struggled to establish a rhythm or take hold of the game, Leo Stolz opened the scoring for UCLA with a bit of clever work at the top of the Washington box. Washington, however, would level only five minutes later with a Josh Heard goal. Heard finished in plenty of space after a well-placed cross by Huskies defender Justin Schmidt. However, it took a mere five minutes for UCLA to regain the lead as Seyi Adekoya finished off a good attack started by a quality tackle in the midfield, capping off an enthralling ten minutes that saw three goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdekoya found himself at the center of attention several times throughout the game. In addition to the goal, Adekoya got the crowd on its feet with a clever turn around midfield. The Freshman forward beat his defender with a brilliantly executed dummy. However, he also put the Bruins down to ten men with two reckless tackles. The first came ten minutes into the game, when Adekoya ran through a Washington player. The second yellow card, which had some slight room for debate but was certainly within reason, came with nearly forty minutes left to play.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter this red card, the Bruins buckled down. However, Washington did not necessarily dictate the flow of play until the closing minutes. Striker Abu Danladi led the lines and kept the pressure on Washington defensively, taking some of the heat off of a solid UCLA defense. Center back Michael Amick, despite looking uncomfortable in possession at times, was solid defensively, including one goal-line clearance. Earl Edwards Jr. put in a shift in goal, coming up with six saves to maintain the conference victory for the Bruins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Bruins followed the victory with a 3-0 drubbing of Oregon State, in a game where Abu Danladi grabbed two goals in the first half. UCLA jumped to #2 in the nation’s RPI rankings with the weekend’s performance. The Bruins now face a trip north to take on Washington and Oregon State away.\u003c/p\u003e",

I kind of just shortened it to DJ Rawrsh because I thought it sounded better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHaha, I’ll have to refer to you as “RAWRSH” from now on it’s got a nice ring to it… So I’ve seen you at a few shows like the Nosaj Thing concert at the Echoplex and that time we went to Low End Theory together. What got you into that kind of music?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI grew up listening to a lot of punk and indie rock music since I grew up in the suburbs and that’s what a lot of my friends were listening to at the time. But in high school I became heavily invested in underground hip-hop (MF Doom, Wu-Tang, Jedi Mind Tricks etc.), and instrumental type music like Nujabes and J Dilla.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI then went to UC Riverside for two years before I transferred over to UCLA. Back at UCR I became friends with this kid Christopher Norwood, who happened to be an up-and-coming producer under the name ‘Repeated Measures’. At the time I was already a fan of the beat scene type of music, like FlyLo and all that, but Chris was the one who introduced me to Low End Theory and this whole underground scene that was burgeoning in Los Angeles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat summer I ended up going to Low End basically every week just because it was so affordable but memorable every time. It’s insane the amount of talented people I’ve been able to meet and learn from just by attending these shows. Very inspirational stuff, it has definitely shaped my overall taste and what inspired me to start ALL CAPS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat’s dope, I see you making all sorts of friends out there too. That’s probably how you get all these guests on the ALL CAPS Show. Speaking of which, how did that all start out with you and Zach, and how did you guys come up with a theme for the show?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonestly, I just started talking to Zach at the meetings about hip-hop and Lil B, and thought that we were on the same wavelength when it came to music. Although I was a little bit more on the underground side of things, Zach is definitely knowledgeable about the more recent side of things when it comes to the hip-hop world, and just has great energy on air. The show would have definitely not been as good if were doing it solo. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had the idea of ALL CAPS in my head during my intern period, and I was greatly influenced by Amber Kong’s hip-hop show, as I was her intern.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI like the shout to MF Doom with ALL CAPS, but it works perfectly because you guys play a lot of hip-hop and do a lot of yelling on the show, I guess you could say you guys speak in ALL CAPS too! It’s been pretty cool interning on the show for you and Zach; it’s definitely influenced how I want to run my show. But before I go, I have to ask… Jedi or Wizard and why?

Redick added 14, saying “I think tonight was a step forward,” saying how “we were better spread offensively.”  Meanwhile, Spencer Hawes had his best game as a Clipper adding 14 points, 8 rebounds, and 3 blocks off the bench, mentioning how “two really good days of practice” contributed to Saturday’s big victory (though Hawes was spotted with his left foot in a walking boot in the locker room after the game).  Matt Barnes also added 12 points in his return to the starting lineup but was ejected in the 4\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e quarter after picking up his 2\u003csup\u003end\u003c/sup\u003e technical foul.  When asked for a reaction to Barnes’ ejection, Coach Rivers simply said “No comment.  I want to save my money.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"505\" data-orig-width=\"379\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a34ddc74dbb15959f0c2ad30f2de22e1/tumblr_inline_nf7lbqj3NP1qhakxc.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a34ddc74dbb15959f0c2ad30f2de22e1/tumblr_inline_pk1si8OWiO1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"505\" data-orig-width=\"379\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a34ddc74dbb15959f0c2ad30f2de22e1/tumblr_inline_nf7lbqj3NP1qhakxc.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eThe Clippers team as a whole shot 53% from the field, hit 14 of their 23 three-point attempts, and got to the line a whopping 43 times (compared to only 23 for the Suns).  They held Phoenix to 38% shooting from the field and though they ceded 19 points each to Goran Dragic and Isaiah Thomas, 17 points and 11 rebounds to Alex Len, and 26 points to Gerald Green, the Clippers held the Morris twins to a combined 8 points, Eric Bledsoe to just 1 point, and really controlled the tempo Saturday against a team well known for playing at one of the fastest paces in the NBA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eWith the victory, the Clippers improve to 5-3 on the season and from here, will conclude their homestand on Monday night as they host the Chicago Bulls at 10:30 PM EST/7:30 PM PST.  Rivers commented that he hadn’t thought about the matchup yet, saying “I’m just thinking about dinner tomorrow with Thibs that he’s gonna pay for.”  And while Griffin downplayed the matchup too saying “I don’t like to get into defining games, especially this early in the season,” he did admit that “this will be a good test for us,” and indeed it will be.  \u003c/p\u003e",

Couldn’t call it unexpected (No. 4)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrack 1, The Bridge I Burned, has a very similar feel to some of his earlier songs, and sounds like some of his combinations with Burt Bacharach such as “In the Darkest Place”. The song has a dual-modality- at times it feels like you’re listening to a sad contemplation of life, and at other times it sounds like you might have accidentally put the \u003cem\u003eFriends\u003c/em\u003e theme song on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo Like Candy was actually co-written by Paul McCartney and Elvis Costello. It’s their song that reflects on a relationship that went sour, and the girl has a now has a shiny new beau that is not Mr. Costello. It’s like a bitter and sad version of your typical break - up song. I’d believe it if this song were on Taylor Swift’s new album coming out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrack 3 is a weird, weird song. It honestly sounds like a mix between “America the Beautiful” (he literally says this phrase in the song), and “We Are the Champions”, with a disproportionate amount of LSD thrown into the mix. The song doesn’t have a consistent feeling or mood throughout like most of the others- instead, it feels like we are descending into the dark depths of Elvis Costello’s thoughts as he reminisces on past victories, failures, and ephemeral thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith his 4th song, Costello recedes from the dark depths of My Dark Life and comes back into what one could call his comfort zone. This song represents one of the frequently visited places in his brain, the one that he exudes in a lot of his more fun, rambunctious songs. For Simon and Garfunkel fans, this song is reminiscent of “At the Zoo”, and uses metaphors to describe the specific place he is in at the time that he is writing this song. The victory horns provide an apt contrast to the womanless, bachelor style life which he indulges himself in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eElvis rounds of the five song album with his song Couldn’t Call it Unexpected (Number Four). The track has myriad instruments backing up the vocals- including instruments that sound like a mandolin, a trumpet, a rolling drum beat, and even a triangle. One would think this track should actually take on the name of track four, because upon closing your eyes, it feels like you are watching the finale to a musical about a clown parade. Upon analysis of the lyrics, though, it’s clear that the song follows the same archetype of “sad songs about girls”. What I call the “parade” music in the background provides a nice juxtaposition to the dejected subtext of the lyrics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eA Taste of Extreme Honey\u003c/em\u003e has everything for a Costello fan- it has the classic sound of juxtaposition that long time Costello listeners can relate to, but also the ingenuity and fluctuation that, at this point, is expected from Elvis Costello’s music.\u003c/p\u003e",

The new record was released on October 7\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e in the US, earning positive reviews and featuring additional talented musicians including Ezra Koenig, Warpaint, A$AP Ferg and more. You can stream the singles from the \u003ca href=\"http://www.sbtrkt.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eartist website\u003c/a\u003e or purchase the deluxe version on iTunes \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/wonder-where-we-land-deluxe/id912107903\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSBTRKT opened the set with \u0026ldquo;Paper Cuts\u0026rdquo;, wearing his recognizable tribal mask and featuring two drummers. Their dueling rhythms and the hypnotizing background visuals created an intense atmosphere that the crowd reacted to accordingly; surprisingly for an LA audience, people were dancing and singing along to every song. Jerome sprinkled tracks both new and old throughout his set, never letting the energy die down. His own enthusiasm was infectious, and the impressive light show of lasers and animated clips combined made for an unexpected sensory experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"500\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bb4673d0847937bf0d7499cbf65bde90/tumblr_inline_ndm4dpCORe1qhakxc.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/62caac77f4d92243b8fbf9dda2ec35d8/tumblr_inline_pk10c1CQjp1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"500\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bb4673d0847937bf0d7499cbf65bde90/tumblr_inline_ndm4dpCORe1qhakxc.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn exciting moment in the set came when rapper Raury joined SBTRKT on stage, performing the single “Higher” and fed off the liveliness of the crowd. Another stand out track from the new album was “War Drums” featuring the haunting vocals of Warpaint, and the fast-paced “NEW DORP. NEW YORK” that exemplified the talent of the drummers on stage. The live drums really added a new layer of power behind the already solid songs, and “Wildfire” was the height of the upbeat set. The encore included a remix of Radiohead’s “Lotus Flower”, which Jerome introduced by saying he doesn’t usually play his remixed work during his live set, but the crowd certainly got into it. He ended the show with “Right Thing To Do”, leaving the crowd yelling for more despite already having left the stage once. Don’t miss SBTRKT’s live show if he comes through your city; it’ll definitely be a night to remember and at the very least will give you a reason to dance!\u003c/p\u003e",

So then I applied the following quarter because I saw that the managers looked friendly and it looked like I could fit in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e What is your favorite part about your show or being a DJ in general?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSimulation 1:\u003c/strong\u003e I love having the chance to introduce my listeners to music that they wouldn’t have found on their own. I am pretty mainstream with music, but when I find something that isn’t on the surface and extremely known and then play it, I know I’ve introduced people to other music that they like and will check out, expanding their horizons\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e What music artist are your currently obsessed with and why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSimulation 1: \u003c/strong\u003eI’m not sure. I love the Black Keys and became obsessed with the Arctic Monkeys when their last album came out, but now I’m in a state of limbo because there isn’t any one band or artist that I’m obsessed with, more like songs. I’ve played a lot of Franz Ferdinand this quarter though, and I like the Sam Smith songs that I’ve heard so far — I guess I could say that’s my new discovery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e What was your aircheck like during your intern quarter?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSimulation 1:\u003c/strong\u003e My air check was a little nerve-racking. I prepared a playlist and made talking points, wrote everything out and was all ready for it, but then when I connected my computer to the soundboard the sound wasn’t quite right. I just let it play because I didn’t know what to do; I’d never had that problem before as an intern. It turned out that although the sound in which I could control from the keyboard was all the way up, the full output sound was only at the halfway point. I didn’t know that until the next quarter when I had my first show, and then after that I didn’t have the problem anymore. But the air check itself was fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

I was already part of several community service organizations, so becoming an intern for UCLA Radio gave me the opportunity to do an extracurricular activity that was a little different (maybe a little selfish but I am loving it so far).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat’s been your favorite album released in the past year?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eMy favorite album of the past year is Sons of the Seas’ self-titled album. I am a huge fan of Incubus and anything related to Brandon Boyd, so when I heard that he had this independent project coming out I was immediately interested. I bought the full album and fell in love. I even dragged my sister along to see the band play at the Belasco Theatre. It was the third time that I saw Brandon Boyd live (true fan). I have always admired the creative musicianship of Incubus and I felt like this album was also very creative in terms of instrumentation, sound texture, and lyrics. This creativity is especially exemplified in the three songs that are my favorites. Maybe Incubus is a little 7th grade, but there is no going wrong with this album. It may lack the normal Incubus angst, but it is such a nice treat from beginning to end! \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRecommended Tracks from Sons of the Sea:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e“Jet Black Crow”\u003cbr/\u003e“Lady Black”\u003cbr/\u003e“Untethered”\u003c/p\u003e",

The crowd begins to sing their 2001 hit, “Someday” out of sheer impatience yet excitement. Then house lights dim and a deep red light filled the stage. The crowd screamed as the shadows of Julian Casablancas (Lead Singer), Nikolai Fraiture (Bassist), Albert Hammond Jr. (Guitarist), and Fabrizio Moretti (Drums) appear. Standing stolidly for about 30 seconds, they tease the crowd with their presence. 3 half-beats of snare drum signify the beginning of their song, “Barely Legal” off of their debut album \u003cem\u003eIs This It\u003c/em\u003e, and the beginning of their set. Released in 2001, the song brought nostalgia to the entire crowd, ranging from students just as myself—I was in elementary school when this 13-year-old song came out—to the parents of those students previously mentioned. The song finished and the crowd went wild, demanding more.\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e The Strokes did not let down at all. Their set consisted of 17 songs, ranging from their smash hits “Reptilia”, from the \u003cem\u003eRoom on Fire\u003c/em\u003e album, and “Last Nite”, from their \u003cem\u003eIs this it\u003c/em\u003e album, to their new songs “One Way Trigger” and “Welcome to Japan” off of their latest album \u003cem\u003eComedown Machine\u003c/em\u003e. Throughout the show, the entire crowd jumped, screamed, and sang as much as their hearts let them. “We don’t want our talking to take time from our set, so we’re just going to play if that’s okay.” Julian states. 16 straight songs later, the band says their goodbyes and walk away.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best moment was the encore of the concert. After 5 minutes of the crowd screaming, “One more song!” the band reappeared. “This one goes out to the homies in Ferguson” Julian Casablancas states as the stage lights turn a patriotic red, white, and blue. A 4 count from the drummer and the band begins to play their most controversial song “New York City Cops” from their album \u003cem\u003eIs This It. \u003c/em\u003eBecause the song was dropped from their US version of their album, only the truest fans knew the song. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e 90 minutes later, the band said their goodbyes to the FYF Festival, thus ending another successful year. The show that The Strokes produced—the energy created—resonated within me for the next two weeks. I still feel nostalgia induced goose bumps when I hear a strokes song. The Strokes: a rare performer, a life changing experience.\u003c/p\u003e",

The complaints of long lines, standing room only, too little beer, and difficulty seeing have all been dealt with.

Not to mention the incredible lineup. Alright alright, I’ll mention it. I’ll talk about it extensively. I’ll let you see pictures. I’ll convince you to go next year. Shh, let me in.

    "title": "Opinions by Eric:The \"Life Story\" Albums of Eminem and Kendrick Lamar",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003eEminem, as a rapper, has had high and low points of famousness and appreciation as an artist throughout his career. Starting from humble roots, Eminem first found popularity with his albums The Slim Shady LP in 1999, and The Eminem Show in 2002. Although he has continued to create albums to this very day, people have lost a lot of respect for his musical talent. One main reason that his perceived value as an artist has decreased is what I would call “loss of talent by association”. Whereas on his older albums, Eminem world consistently rap with the talented likes of Dr. Dre, Obie Trice, and Nate Dogg, many people now view Eminem as Rihanna’s “associated act” on tracks like Love the Way You Lie. The analysis that I want to explore with this piece is not about his perceived downfall, however. Instead, I want to look at Eminem around his peak, with Encore in 2005, and draw some strong comparisons to Kendrick Lamar’s highly acclaimed album good kid, m.A.A.D. city.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoth of these albums are mirrors of the respective artists’ life stories. For Kendrick Lamar, he tells his story as a teenager in Compton, and specific scenarios and feelings that made him into the person that created the album that he produced. The songs in the album have many varying topics form his lifetime- “Sherane” describes a women from his teenage years that he was interested in, “Money Trees” describes the arrival of fame into his lifestyle (and its effects), and “Swimming Pools” describes the highly prevalent alcoholism that surrounded his upbringing. As a whole, it is easy to see that all of these aspects are formative to the growth of Kendrick Lamar, and it is almost as if he wants to explain why he is the way he is through his art.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe see a lot of the same intention and expression in Eminem’s Encore.  In “Cleaning Out My Closet”, Eminem shares his childhood issues, and why he believes his mother was never fit to raise children; in “The Real Slim Shady”, he takes a mirror to his own life, and attempts to avoid the disingenuous façade he believes many artists have; and in “Mockingbird”, he talks about what he would do for his daughters sake.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough the scenarios described in both of these works are clearly different, what remains the same is the overall intention of the work. Both artists are giving a mirror to reflect their life, and showing exactly what has lead them to this point in their career. One stark contrast that we do see is the intent with which the artists go about it. Whereas Kendrick’s album seems like a mere retelling, Eminem’s album seems an almost apologetic excuse for all of the things he’s done in his life. This tonal difference gives the artists music very different feels for this album.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven though Eminem would later not receive the same acclaim for his rap albums, it is important to look to Eminem’s earlier works such as Encore in order to see not only his musical roots, but why he achieved fame in the first place. Encore’s similarities to good kid, m.A.A.D city help us to remind the context of both of these artists during their prime eras, and why both of them are so famous in unique ways in the world of rap.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy: Eric A. \u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003eCheck Yo Ponytail’s first event of 2015 proved a fitting finale for Trash Talk’s powerhouse tour with supporting acts Ratking and Lee Bannon. The groups converged with Together Pangea at the Echoplex on March 20\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e for a spectacle of hardcore across many genres. The tour’s diverse lineup, along with the fact that it ended in Los Angeles, gave CYP an opportunity to add to their catalogue of shows\u003csup\u003e1\u003c/sup\u003e. Together Pangea was included in the bill last minute– a sort of bonus from CYP, to solidify the event and distinguish it from the tour’s other stops. Though an interesting addition, Together Pangea’s Burgerama-ish, pop-punk sound felt out of place, and paled in comparison with the tour veterans.

The same goes for Hak, who jumps deftly between melodic croon and gritty rap, never abandoning his signature poetic voice.\u003csup\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e Sporting Life’s live translation of beats expands his role as a hip-hop DJ into an architect-like coordinator– rather than just spin tracks, he builds them.

CYP\u003ci\u003e, \u003c/i\u003ean IHEARTCOMIX subsidiary, started in 2006 as a small weekly party at Safari Sam’s, and has been organizing events of increasing musical magnitude in LA ever since. CYP’s events work somewhat like a guided tour that hops between different stages at a festival: they curate diverse musicians into impressively compatible lineups at contained venues, avoiding the hassle and complexities of a festival. Previous acts vary in prominence from local obscurities to the Rolling Stones (who held their first club show in 20 years at a CYP event), and in musical style (DIIV vs. Killer Mike, The Kooks vs. Trash Talk, etc.).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2. In other words, it was chill. Apart from his music, Lee was pretty down to earth: he finished a couple tallboys during the set, jumped in the crowd to schmooze with fans, and gave out stickers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3. L.B. started out as a beatmaker, with a stint as Pro Era’s DJ. He holds production credits for several Joey Bada$$ tracks (e.g. “Hillary $wank”). His solo career found him signed to Ninja Tune, and transitioning from boom-bap to explorations in jungle, drum and bass, ambient, and dubstep. While L.B.’s set showcased this experimentalism, certain moments were reminiscent of the organic groove and soulfulness of his beatmaking roots.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e4. So Ratking is a hip-hop group with three members, which technically makes them a hip-hop trio, but they should primarily be addressed as a band, as their dynamic is that of interdependent musicians. Like their namesake (the folkloric “rat king,” where a bunch of rats are joined by tangled tails) the group’s whole is greater than the sum of its parts. I say that not to diminish from the individual talents of its members, but rather to praise their group synergy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e5. Ratking wants to be considered punk. Since punk music is linked so intractably to the live set, concerts find the group in its natural habitat. Though the internet has been incremental to their success, Ratking’s earliest exposure came from playing at lots of small, underground venues (or “dungeons,” as Wiki calls them) and their onstage confidence and vitality exemplify this.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Breaking Down a Tough Weekend For Bruin Baseball",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003eBy Andrew Gerson\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009UCLA baseball fans had high expectations for the past weekend, facing perennially talented Vanderbilt, TCU, and the infamous cross-town rivals. Unfortunately the Bruins went 0-3, and the team’s claim to the NCAA’s #6 ranking was weakened significantly. What went wrong, and will it happen again?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Facing Vanderbilt on Friday, UCLA simply could not stand up to Carson Fulmer, who earned his third victory of the season. Despite only throwing 50% of his pitches for strike, Fulmer got the Bruins to chase all night, racking up 9 strikeouts and giving up only 3 hits. UCLA did take advantage of his wildness with 5 walks, but they failed to get a big hit before Philip Pfeifer shut them down for the last 2 2/3 innings of the game. Starting for UCLA, James Kaprielian wasn’t able to stop the Vanderbilt offense despite his impressive swing-and-miss stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Against TCU, the Bruins again looked outmatched at the plate, striking out 9 times in Alex Young’s 8 innings for the Horned Frogs. However, with Grant Watson and the bullpen able to keep the team in the game, the difference came on a catcher’s interference call in the 6\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e inning that allowed TCU’s Barzilli to double in 2 runs. UCLA had a chance to win this one, but the bats once again failed to supplement the team’s good pitching staff.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Playing USC at Dodger Stadium, the Bruins fell behind early but tied the game at 3-3 with a big 3\u003csup\u003erd\u003c/sup\u003e inning and Christoph Bono’s first long ball of the year. This time the pitchers faltered, with Cody Poteet only lasting 3.2 innings and the subsequent relievers giving up 4 runs over the next 3.1 innings. With 11 hits to USC’s 14, the game could have had a different outcome with some more timely hitting. Ultimately, the team couldn’t stop a Trojan offense that scored in 6 of 9 innings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Fortunately, this looks to be a minor slump for a team that has excelled so far in the young season. Grant Watson has been brilliant so far in his final season as a Bruin, and the offense has been generally productive thanks to the big start from the top of the lineup. The bullpen needs improvement, but relievers are often volatile and could experience a quick turnaround. Perhaps the most important change for the team’s long-term success would be improvement from Kaprielian, Poteet, and Griffin Canning who are all allowing about a hit per inning. It may be bad luck, but their success is critical to the pitching staff. \u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Future Already Looking Bright for UCLA Football’s 2015 Season\nBy: Nicole Kern",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003eLots of exciting news and changes are brewing in Westwood this offseason with UCLA having its most impressive signing day in recent history and the departure of the defensive coach, Jeff Ulbrich, to the NFL’s Atlanta Falcons. This week culminated with UCLA being ranked ninth in Mark Schlaback’s new Way-Too-Early predictions. \u0009On signing day UCLA signed several new players to their already impressive young roster.  Here is the scoop on the top new recruits.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChris Clark:\nA four-star tight end recruit from Connecticut signed with UCLA over Michigan. Rivals.com and Scout.com ranked Clark first in the country for tight ends. Clark was originally committed to UCLA but backed out after Michigan replaced Coach Brady Hoke with Jim Harbaugh Tight end is not a position that UCLA normally utilizes so it will be interesting to see how UCLA incorporates him into the team.  Clark emphasized Jim Mora’s role in his choice claiming Mora has been like a “second dad” in the past few weeks. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSoso Jamabo:\nFive-star running back Soso Jamabo from Texas chose UCLA over UT and Notre Dame. The running back was a standout in Texas having 484 rushing yards and 6 touchdowns. Jamabo was so excited about signing with UCLA that he declared he would stay with the Bruins for the next four years. UCLA’s backfield is already crowded with three running backs returning to UCLA, including standout Paul Perkins. The Bruin’s second leading rusher was quarterback Brett Hundley who has entered the draft this year, which does leave a possibility for Jamabo to start this season and really make a difference in UCLA’s offense. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJosh Wariboko:\nA four-star offensive guard picks UCLA over Oklahoma and others and will join his cousin Soso Jamabo. The offensive line was probably UCLA’s weakest area and bringing in a top recruit can only help the line. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCordell Broadus:\nCordell Broadus may be the most talked about recruit from signing day as he is Snoop Dogg’s son and a four-star receiver.  Broadus has some competition in starting for the Bruins as both of UCLA’s top receiver’s, Thomas Duarte and Jordan Payton, will be returning next season. Snoop Dogg is an avid USC fan, but he now says he will throw away all of his USC gear and throw his full support behind the Bruins.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKeisean Lucier-South: A five-star defensive end that signed early on with UCLA. Lucier-South is considered to be a great replacement for former UCLA player Anthony Barr to ensure UCLA’s defense’s continued dominant performance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJosh Rosen: The number 1 quarterback and a 5 star recruit from Southern California. Described as “having it all” he not only brings a lot of talent to the team on his own, but his early commitment also was a significant draw for the other top recruits. Rosen has a tough battle to becoming the starting QB with both Jerry Neuheisal and Asiantii Woolard both very much still in the running. Rosen has incredible arm strength, but is still capable of running the ball, which is a large characteristic of UCLA’s offense. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith such an impressive class the talk of National Championships has begun again. UCLA was not the only school with an impressive recruiting class. UCLA got the 2nd best recruiting class in the nation with only 1 point making the difference between them and Alabama. UCLA’s class was ranked seventh in the nation. This could strike fear in Bruins for their annual matchup with the crosstown rival.\u003c/p\u003e",

There\u0026rsquo;s a strong sense of intimacy and place to Pratt\u0026rsquo;s acoustic folk balladry. She rarely, if ever, rises above a whisper. The timbre of her voice falls somewhere between that of Stevie Nicks, Kath Bloom, and Vashti Bunyan, and her hushed conversational delivery of unfussy lyrics makes every tale she tells feel of the utmost importance. And then there\u0026rsquo;s the hum of her home, the constant background warmth of her lived-in space that\u0026rsquo;s a key component to all of her recordings. Listening to Pratt\u0026rsquo;s music is instant escapism; she invites you into her private world, only asking for you to lend an ear in return.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is this striking sense of solitude that made me hesitant to see Pratt perform live. To be fair, The Echo is a relatively minuscule venue in relation to, say, the Hollywood Bowl, or even the El Rey. It can seemingly only fit about one hundred people at capacity. Nonetheless, I feared the tiny world she crafted on On Your Own Love Again, the world I found so much comfort in, would crumble under the weight of an audience greater than the fictional sole listener in Pratt\u0026rsquo;s living room. To add to this, it was uncharacteristically rainy for a February night in Southern California, and the crowd was rowdy with both delight and confusion at the prospect of precipitation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Pratt finally entered the stage, following charming opener Matt Kivel, the room fell silent. She nonchalantly sat down and began to talk, shocking me with the stark difference between her singing voice and speaking voice. I raised my phone to take a picture of her, but felt like I had infiltrated that sense of intimacy when we locked eyes after I snapped the shot. That was the first indicator of the dichotomy between the setting and tone of Pratt\u0026rsquo;s performance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePratt herself was ethereal and arresting. With just an acoustic six string and flourishes of electric guitar as her backing, she closed her eyes and dove deep within, summoning the otherworldly being that is her voice. Her performance felt deeply personal and earnest, and each word that was slowly and subtly unleashed held vast emotional weight on its shoulders. Every aspect of Pratt\u0026rsquo;s set felt immensely considered, down to the enunciation of vowels and weight with which she plucked her guitar strings. It is obvious that she truly loves what she does, and her talents are undoubtedly overflowing.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eHowever, the venue didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be on Pratt\u0026rsquo;s side on Saturday night. The sound was a tad muddy, and Pratt\u0026rsquo;s voice often became more of a texture than its own entity. There was an unruly fog machine that she, and every other artist performing that night, had to request to turn off during their set due to it\u0026rsquo;s loud metallic buzzing. The walls in the bathrooms must\u0026rsquo;ve been built extra thin, too, as Pratt\u0026rsquo;s set was consistently interrupted by the guttural roar of a hand dryer and slamming stall doors. The crowd quickly grew restless and chatty, making it difficult to understand what Pratt was relaying to us. At one point, during \u0026ldquo;Back Baby,\u0026rdquo; a member of the audience behind me fainted and had to be dragged to safety. Obviously, I cannot fault a concert goer for their potentially frightening health scare that they had no control over, but the list of distractions grew so numerous and impossible to ignore that the world Jessica Pratt was constructing before us crumbled apart again, and again, and again, and again.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe shortcomings of the venue is not necessarily Pratt\u0026rsquo;s issue, though, and as a performer, there was little, if any, more that I could ask from her than what she gave that night. However, I find myself repeatedly asking the same question: if Pratt\u0026rsquo;s live set can\u0026rsquo;t withstand the tiny Echo, then what venue would suffice?\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eBut when her tour mate that accompanied her on the electric guitar left the stage for Pratt\u0026rsquo;s final song, she once again silenced the entire building and almost entirely redeemed the downfalls of The Echo. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t familiar with the song she played; perhaps it was from her self-titled debut LP, with which I am less familiar than her most recent release; perhaps it was something new. That didn\u0026rsquo;t matter; what matters is that I have zero recollection of what was happening around me during that song, and Pratt was able to recreate the intimacy of \u003ci\u003eOn Your Own Love Again\u003c/i\u003e with astonishing ease. Maybe where an artist shares their craft isn\u0026rsquo;t always important. Maybe what an artist does live will never fully live up to what they create on tape, and vice versa. What I do know, though, is that Pratt\u0026rsquo;s final song left enough of an effect on me that I\u0026rsquo;m certain she\u0026rsquo;ll be an important figure in music for many years to come. You can ask almost anyone: it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to ignore a talent as unique as hers.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-height=\"464\" data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ee762b4231f81a4d1fefac6749a26786/tumblr_inline_nkpmo1n9hy1qhakxc.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ee762b4231f81a4d1fefac6749a26786/tumblr_inline_peib17RhWf1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-height=\"464\" data-orig-width=\"300\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ee762b4231f81a4d1fefac6749a26786/tumblr_inline_nkpmo1n9hy1qhakxc.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

This made way for some of the most bizarre, but truly wild and times very humorous to the audience such as seeing ol’ Abraham Lincoln dance around with two dogs (who were dressed in a very patriotic one-piece with large breasts that fight each other before stripping off their clothes. YEAH, THAT HAPPENED.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"960\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2c78afa2daab53b02294621bc339c0e2/tumblr_inline_nm3ao6UG9c1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"960\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat seemed like the most nostalgic for all audience members alike was watching their reactions to the start of “The Party’s Crashing Us”, which was right before the encore. The dancing almost never stopped throughout this whole show. It was a literal party for everyone and Kevin Barnes and the rest of the band made sure everyone’s asses were shaking. Unfortunately, after the band played a gracious amount of extra songs for the encore, they closed off with “The Past Is A Grotesque Animal” (which is a great fit for such a closer as their new live movie of the same name just released last year). Kudos to Mr. Barnes. Over a decade’s worth of playing around with the live show environment for Of Montreal really turned into a unique and unforgettable time at the Regent. Much love for the laughs, nostalgia, and very impressive live Of Montreal experience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6711a8035282ded4e90c7fc97efd791d/tumblr_inline_nm3a0gct2y1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"1280\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhotos \u0026amp; Words: \u003c/i\u003eEddie Hernandez\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Can UCLA Basketball make the Big Dance?",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eBy Ariq Chowdhury\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe beauty of March Madness is that upsets are the normal and every school – whether it’s undefeated Kentucky or big dance rookies North Florida – believes it just might have a chance to win it all. The 2015 NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament officially starts March 17, but Coach Alford and the UCLA Bruins have to worry about the Pac-12 Tournament before they can start dreaming.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough Selection Sunday (March 15) is the day teams officially find out if they are one of the 68 who made the tournament and where they’re seeded, hundreds of amateur and professional bracketologists across the country have essentially calculated the NCAA selection committee’s final decisions to a science. They look at all factors of every team’s resume – win-loss records, strength of schedule, point differential, etc. –  to determine who the best teams in college basketball are and if they’re truly worthy to make it to the league’s greatest stage. UCLA actually doesn’t fare too poorly in many of these rankings (they rank 50\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e in RPI, which measures teams by the aforementioned factors and more), but they played in a weak conference, have few signature victories, and have ultimately looked mediocre throughout the season. Most are predicting that UCLA will just miss the cut, but the season’s not over yet and the Bruins still have a chance!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo what do they have to do to make it into the final March Madness bracket? Simple – beat USC tomorrow and then scratch out a win against Arizona, the 5\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e highest ranked team in the country, the very next day after. Yikes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUSC is coming off a thrilling comeback win against ASU earlier today, as it defied all odds by going on a 19-2 tear to end the game to win as the lowest seeded team in the tournament. While some might think this is a bad result for the Bruins as it eliminates the chance for a signature win against a decent ASU team, this was actually the best possible outcome for UCLA. The selection committee would not consider a victory over ASU a signature win, so the difference between beating USC rather than ASU is almost negligible for the Bruins. USC has proven to be the worst team in the conference this season and lost to UCLA in both previous meetings this season, including the final regular season game just a week ago. On top of that, the Trojans will surely be on tired legs tomorrow as they face the Bruins on the second night of a back to back. Truthfully, if the Bruins can’t get up to beat their inferior cross-town rivals, they don’t deserve to make it into the tournament. So assuming that UCLA will get a win over USC and Arizona beats Cal tomorrow, Bruins and Wildcats will get to face off in both schools’ biggest game of the year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eArizona has already earned their place in March Madness after a fantastic 28 win season, but they’re fighting for a number one seed in March Madness. They won’t hold back at all, as a number one seed rather than a two or three means they would have an easier road to the Final Four. If the Bruins can beat a motivated Arizona team, they’ll convince this pessimistic UCLA fan that they have the fight to compete against the big boys. More importantly, they will convince the NCAA selection committee that they deserve to be in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt will all come down to the next two days. Can the country’s most storied college basketball program beat the most dominant team in the west? Maybe not, but who knows – anyone has a chance.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "MLB Cali Grades by Andrew Gerson",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003eWith Spring Training games on the horizon, most teams are finished making their offseason moves. None of the California teams had an awful winter, but some teams look completely revamped, while others look very similar to their 2014 predecessors. Let’s hand out some grades and see who is poised to contend for the upcoming season.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLos Angeles Dodgers: The Dodgers began their offseason with a front office makeover, hiring Andrew Friedman as president of baseball operations and tabbing the popular A’s executive Farhan Zaidi as the team’s GM. The upgrade from former GM Ned Colletti cannot be understated and was arguably the Dodgers’ most important move before Spring Training. However, Friedman and Zaidi did not sit on a roster that won 94 games last year, trading for Jimmy Rollins to replace Han-Ram, as well as Howie Kendrick for Dee Gordon through a series of moves. They also got younger, acquiring several intriguing prospects from the Marlins for Gordon along with catcher Yasmani Grandal and pitcher Joe Wieland in the Matt Kemp trade. Dealing Kemp to San Diego – with a significant portion of his salary – enables Joc Pederson to compete for a starting role while lessening the team’s obligations for the future. Not only does the team have a better roster than the year before, its future looks brighter than ever. Grade: A+\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSan Francisco Giants: Coming off their third World Series win in five years, Giants fans expected the organization to use the extra revenue to sign a marquee free agent – if not more. Not only did they fail to resign Pablo Sandoval, but Jon Lester and James Shields also spurned the team, leaving them with little recourse to improve a weak starting rotation whose only certainty is a pitcher who threw 270 innings in 2014. Signing Nori Aoki was a prudent, cost-effective move, but the offense may struggle without the power of the aforementioned Sandoval and slugger Mike Morse. The options at 3B were limited, but one has to imagine that Casey McGehee was not the best player available on the trade market. Perhaps sticking to the formula will work, but Sabean \u0026amp; Co. should have done more. Grade: C-\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSan Diego Padres: The Pads weren’t terrible last year, going 77-85, but young GM A.J. Preller decided to try something different in the offseason. Trading most of the team’s top prospects, he acquired Justin Upton, Matt Kemp, Wil Myers, Will Middlebrooks, Derek Norris, and underrated bullpen piece Brandon Maurer. It remains to be seen how the team will survive defensively without a natural CF among their starters or a solid defensive catcher, but the Friars will certainly be an offensive presence. After inking a good deal for James Shields, the rotation looks strong with Andrew Cashner, Tyson Ross, Ian Kennedy, and Brandon Morrow joining the formal Royals’ ace. The short-term moves may cost them dearly in the future, but for now the Padres are a team to watch. Grade: B+\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLos Angeles Angels: Deeply committed to Albert Pujols and Josh Hamilton, the Angels didn’t have much in the way of spending money this offseason and subsequently were somewhat inactive. However, they did improve upon their primary weakness, SP, by acquiring prospect Andrew Heaney for Howie Kendrick. If Garrett Richards and Tyler Skaggs can successfully recover from their injuries, this group could be one of the deeper rotations in the AL. Kendrick’s replacement, former Rockie Josh Rutledge, won’t have the same kind of impact but doesn’t figure to be a negative either. Losing Hamilton to February surgery certainly hurts an already righty-heavy lineup, but the offense still figures to be productive with the best player in baseball hitting in the 2 spot. Grade: C\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOakland A’s: Breaking down all of Billy Beane’s moves would be a hassle, so it’s best to just look at the final result. After collapsing down the stretch last year, the lineup is very different, featuring younger players such as Brett Lawrie and Marcus Semien, bounceback candidates Billy Butler and Ike Davis, and the always productive Ben Zobrist. If Jarrod Parker and A.J. Griffin can quickly return from TJ surgery, the rotation following Sonny Gray and Scott Kazmir will be deep thanks to the acquisition of Jesee Hahn in the Derek Norris trade. The farm has also been revitalized from trades, receiving multiple top prospects from the Blue Jays as well as other good pieces from San Diego and the White Sox. While 2015 won’t be what A’s fans had envisioned during 2014, the team is ready to continue its run of success. Grade: B\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "NBA Eastern Conference Playoffs Preview",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003eChase Madorsky\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the regular season comes to a conclusion, playoff race in the NBA Eastern Conference is tighter than ever. At the top of the Eastern Conference are the Atlanta Hawks, who have set a new franchise record with 60 wins, as coach Mike Budenholzer has effectively utilized his four All Star starters (Kyle Korver, Jeff Teague, Paul Millsap, and Al Horford) in a Spurs inspired team system of basketball. Locked into the two seed in the east are the Cleveland Cavaliers, who’s big three of LeBron James, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Love have combined with trade pickups J.R. Smith and Timofy Mozkov to form what may be the NBA’s most dynamic starting five. Fighting for the three seed with identical records are the 48-32 Toronto Raptors and Chicago Bulls. (Note: The Raptors own the head to head tiebreaker). Hurt by the injuries to superstars Derrick Rose, Joakim Noah, and Jimmy Butler, the Bulls have nonetheless remained in the thick of the playoff race thanks to an All-Star, bounce back year from Pau Gasol. However, one must wonder if it is to little, to late to catch the Raptors, who despite struggling through multiple five game losing streaks have rounded into form, led by the backcourt duo of Kyle Lowry and Demar Derozan. Locked into the five seed are the 45-34 Washington Wizards, who despite inconsistent play all year are always a dangerous matchup thanks to the a combination of speed, veteran leadership, and size that can be seen through point guard John Wall, future Hall of Fame forward Paul Pierce, and center Nene. At 40-40, the six seed is the surprising Milwaukee Bucks, who in Jason Kidd’s first season have used a combination of length and athleticism that has fans excited for the future.  Fueled by a midseason trade for Point Guard Isaiah Thomas and led by former Butler Coach Brad Stevens, the upstart Celtics currently hold the seven seed in the Eastern Conference with a 38-42 record, despite trading away many of their assets in what appeared to be an open rebuilding effort. Only a game behind the Celtics are the 37-43 Brooklyn Nets, who despite their sky high payroll hope to make noise in the playoffs behind a healthy Deron Williams and rejuvenated play from Brooke Lopez. On the outside looking are the Indiana Pacers, who despite the return of Paul George from injury currently sit a half game back of the Nets with a 36-43 record.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Eastern Conference is clearly not what it once was, as evident from the fact that the bottom three playoff teams all may finish with a record below 500. However, the top of the Eastern Conference could easily bring a Larry O’Brien trophy back home with them. Look for the Conference to be decided in a seven game series between the two best teams the East has to offer, the Hawks and the Cavs. Although the Hawks have without question been a top three team in the league all season with their selfless and team style of play, at they also lack what I consider to be a truly dominant scoring presence, which I feel that every championship team needs. For this reason, LeBron James will continue his homecoming party and lead the Cavs into the NBA Finals, as his take-over ability combined with Kyrie Irving’s shooting and Kevin Love’s inside out presence will simply be to much for Atlanta to handle. Even if the Hawks starting 5 hangs in there with LeBron and company, the Cavs bench, led by Tristan Thompson, Iman Shumpert, and Mike Miller will be to much for the injury laden Hawks to handle, who will greatly miss the bench presence of Thabo Sefolosha who is out for the year with a broken leg.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003eChase Madorsky\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs with every great run in March Madness, the UCLA Men’s Basketball Team returned home knowing that the team that got them to the Sweet 16 for the second straight year would be drastically different the year after. Gone would be senior guard Norman Powell, who anchored the Bruins Offense with 16.4 points per game en route to a First Team All Pac-12 selection. Although expected, projected lottery pick Kevon Looney, who led all freshman in double-doubles nationally to go along with 11.6 points and 9.2 rebounds per game, declared that he to would be leaving Westwood for the greener pastures of the NBA. In an instance, a team that captivated the student body of UCLA was torn apart; gone were their leading scorer and rebounder, leaving major gaps in the Bruin’s rotation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, rather than dwell at the past, Bruin fans should look forward to what Coach Steve Alford’s team will have to offer next year with hope. Remaining with the Bruins are their point guard, Bryce Alford, who is coming off a season where he average 15.4 PPG and 4.9 assists per game. Yet it wasn’t until the round of 64 matchup with SMU where Bryce showed what he was capable of, where he made 9-11 three-point shots, including the game winner to send the Bruins to the Round of 32. Alford will have the benefit of having his backcourt running mate Isaac Hamilton back to play alongside him. Although Hamilton at times appeared uncomfortable overall, his play picked up substantially over the second half of the season, peaking with a career high 36 point effort in a win against USC in the Pac-12 Tournament that proved Hamilton could be trusted as a dynamic scorer. In the front court, starting center Tony Parker will return to anchor the Bruins defense, where he will aim to improve on his 2014-2015 play by cutting down on his fouls and stepping in as the primary rebounder for the Bruins. Off the bench, Thomas Welsh will attempt to solidify himself as a reliable big man off the bench with his 7 foot frame, while Gygory Goloman will continue to become integrated into the offense as a stretch four who can draw defenses away from the hoop with his outside shooting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYet the biggest reason for Bruin fans to look on in excitement for the 2015-2016-basketball season is another stellar Steve Alford recruiting class. Although ruled academically ineligible this past season, Jonah Bolden will make his anticipated debut with the Bruins. A 6-8 Power Forward from Australia who was a four star recruit and ranked 69th overall in the 2014 ESPN 100, Bolden will be looked upon to fill the void left by Looney in the starting five. Combined with four-star guards Prince Ali and Aaron Holiday, this trio will look to make an immediate impact for the Bruins. Even more help can be on the way, as five star recruit and number two overall recruit Jaylen Brown, number six recruit Ivan Rabb, and number 10 recruit Stephen Zimmerman have all received offers from UCLA and are considering the Bruins as National Signing Day approaches.\u003c/p\u003e",

While art and cuisine are an intrinsic part of the JazzReggae experience, the featured musical guests continue to be the selling point for fans.  This weekend, Festivalgoers can expect a fairly eclectic lineup that’ll top off with a headlining performance by D.C. rapper, Wale.  Besides the emcee himself, the festival will feature a number of other notable acts such as the psychedelic rock outfit Portugal. The Man, up-and-coming producer Lido, and Jamaica-native Keznamdi—An act that’ll remain true to the festival’s original jazz and reggae sensibilities.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat said, it’s worth noting that JazzReggae has come a long way since it’s low-profile beginnings.  In 1986, the festival emerged as a platform for student musicians to perform for the general public.  As it garnered increasing amounts of interest and popularity over the years, the event experienced a dramatic shift away from being an event featuring student performers exclusively, and gravitated towards booking professional, mainstream acts.  Some of the more noteworthy past appearances include: Snoop Dogg, Erykah Badu, Shaggy, Little Dragon, and De La Soul.  Despite the big names that have driven the popularity of this festival for the past several years, JazzReggae prides itself on remaining an entirely student-produced event. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter almost three decades since its humble inception, this festival has been anything but stagnant.  In its 29\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e year, JazzReggae Fest builds on a longstanding tradition by implementing new genres and targeting new demographics in hopes that it will serve as an ample reflection of the rich and evolving culture of Los Angeles. This year, the festival will be held over the course of one day instead of two, and will take place in the Los Angeles Tennis Center.  For even more information and tickets, check out the official website at \u003ca href=\"http://jazzreggaefest.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ejazzreggaefest.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e- Doug Gil\u003c/p\u003e",

Badalamenti produced an ambience of nostalgia as fans revisited significant scenes from the television series. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe program was then followed by pioneer rock musician Donovan who created a mellow mood as he sang “Love Me Tender” from the film “Wild at Heart”. Lynch’s muse, Chrysta Bell, then entered the stage with a sparkling dress and cape that captivated the public as she enthralled them with her radiance appearance and sensuality. The lighting on stage turned completely bright, blinding the audience in the balcony area who repeatedly blinked. This was certainly an artistic move since the song “Swing With Me” is found on the Lynch-produced album “This Train”, hence, the strong lighting. Her performance was however delightful and full of charm as she bid farewell with a blowing kiss. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOther powerful performances were from indie pop rockers Tennis and Twin Peaks. They collaborated to perform Roy Orbison’s “In Dreams” from the film Blue Velvet. Alaina Moore and her husband Patrick Riley began their set standing very close to each other to establish a romantic setting. Her voice lined up with the theme of dreams, creating a surreal experience drawn from her talent. The public sang along as they revisited the memorable scene where Dennis Hopper cries and abruptly stops the song to due to its overpowering effects. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"792\" data-orig-width=\"594\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/210a1eb65e1c98527bad712a968bbae5/tumblr_inline_nmf3v29Mgg1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"792\" data-orig-width=\"594\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerformers like Moby transformed the venue into a dance club by presenting a musical piece with the accompaniment of bongos and soulful backup singers. This was an unseen side of Moby but fun to see how he created a funky pattern of beats without the use of a turntable. Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs also performed an upbeat song, “Pinky’s Dream”, from Lynch’s project “Candy-Colored Clown.” Duran Duran stole the night as they played their 80s classics “Ordinary World” and “Hungry Like The Wolf” making fans get up from their chairs and dance endlessly. Other artists such as Lykke Li, Zola Jesus and Flaming Lips members Wayne Coyne and Steve Drozd, recaptured the concert’s original atmosphere as they performed enigmatic songs that demanded close attention and silence. Jim James from My Morning Jacket performed “Sycamore Trees” dressed up in a black tie and suit, accompanied by a saxophone player who prolonged the mysterious aura of Lynch’s films. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAcapella singer Rebekah Del Rio completely haunted the theatre with her dynamic vocal strings as she sang “Llorando” from the film Mulholland Drive. Her performance received the only standing ovation of the night after David Lynch himself appeared on stage to conclude the concert with an inspiring message of meditation: “May everyone be free of disease. May auspiciousness be singing everywhere. May suffering belong to no one. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"573\" data-orig-width=\"640\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/84dbc795aa9d3329a2fdd4ee68197085/tumblr_inline_nmf3vhDilI1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"573\" data-orig-width=\"640\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhotos \u0026amp; Words: \u003c/i\u003eMichelle Preciado\u003c/p\u003e",

With the Bruins’ sole loss of the season coming to UNC, the team stands as a consensus top-10 team with their 9-1 record. Backed by strong pitching and typical UCLA small-ball, the Bruins enter an important last non-conference week on a high note.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-height=\"380\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dac5ca59aac0ce2e3094238ce1a4ce85/tumblr_inline_nknsf56fVY1qhakxc.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4430812bd0cc147642b336ded7e9fe61/tumblr_inline_pk34lcPlqg1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"380\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dac5ca59aac0ce2e3094238ce1a4ce85/tumblr_inline_nknsf56fVY1qhakxc.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eA pair of triples led to the first two UCLA runs. A Chris Keck triple in the first inning saw Ty Moore cross the plate. In the fifth, shortstop Kevin Kramer reached on a triple on what could have been a routine fly ball if not for the uncharacteristic wind in Westwood and scored on a sacrifice fly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the damage done by the Bruin offense came in the bottom of the seventh. After UCLA bunted two runners into scoring position for Ty Moore, who is batting .550 on the season, Michigan State intentionally walked the bases full for Chris Keck. Keck made the Spartans pay with a bases-clearing double that put UCLA up by five runs, putting the game beyond the reach of Michigan State, who struggled with the Bruins’ pitching.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGrant Dyer came into the game in the eighth and threw hard, allowing no base runners and making quick work of the bottom of the Michigan State order. Finally, former walk-on and now-elite closer David Berg closed the game out, giving up only one hit to the top of the order for the Big Ten opponents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe shutout win comes in the second game of a three-game series with Michigan State, and less than one week away from a high-profile matchup with Vanderbilt. The Bruins will also face rivals USC in Dodger Stadium on Sunday, March 8. The Bruins will also formally start conference play on Friday, March 13 against Washington at Jackie Robinson Stadium.\u003c/p\u003e",

Garfunkel.  Han Solo and Chewbacca.  Abbott and Costello.  John Lennon and Paul McCartney.  Peanut butter and jelly.  Now it just might be time to add Chris Paul and Blake Griffin to that list.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe dynamic duo combined for a whopping 58 points on Sunday night at the Staples Center as the Los Angeles Clippers won their playoff opener against the San Antonio Spurs by the final of 107-92.  Hosting the defending champs in Round 1 is no walk in the park and use it as an argument for abolishing the NBA’s antiquated divisional seeding rules if you will, but the Lob City alpha males certainly came to play in Game 1.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003ePaul posted a massive 32 point, 7 rebound, 6 assist line while Griffin tacked on 26 points, 12 rebounds, 6 assists, and 2 memorable poster dunks on hapless Spurs center Aron Baynes as the Clippers rode 51% shooting night against a Spurs team ranked 3\u003csup\u003erd\u003c/sup\u003e in the league in defensive efficiency for the season to victory.  Jamal Crawford added 17 points off the bench while DeAndre Jordan had 9 points, 14 rebounds, and 4 blocked shots.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Clippers hit 10 three-pointers at a 56% clip on the evening and dominated the Spurs inside (46 points in the paint) as well as in transition (23 fast break points).  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut as impressive as a performance as it was on the offensive end for LAC, it was all that and more on the defensive end as well.  The team rotated crisply along the perimeter on defense, suffocating a Spurs team known for its impeccable interior passing ability to the tune of 14 forced turnovers.  Jordan was playing like his entire Defensive Player of the Year candidacy rested solely on his performance in this one game while Griffin’s instincts on the defensive end were sharp as well evidenced by his 3 steals and 3 blocks on the evening.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Clippers held the Spurs to just 37% from the field and though some of that can be chalked up to San Antonio simply missing good, open looks, Coach Doc Rivers’ troops certainly deserve to be commended for the defensive effort they put forth on Sunday.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eReigning Finals MVP Kawhi Leonard led San Antonio with 18 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists while the legend Tim Duncan put up 11 points, 11 rebounds, and 4 assists.  But the rest of the team might as well have describe trying to solve the Clippers defense as like trying to solve a Rubik’s Cube.  Danny Green shot 2-for-11 from the field, Boris Diaw outstank him with a 2-for-12 line, Manu Ginobili was just 3-for-10, and Tony Parker (who twisted his left ankle early) didn’t fare much better with a 4-for-11 line.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was an uncharacteristically flat performance by a San Antonio squad that shot 47% from the field in the regular season and they struggled to match the intensity and physicality that the Clippers were able to maintain over all 48 minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Clippers jumped out to a 12-point lead after the first quarter, really feeding off the energy of a raucous Staples Center crowd that was much louder than it had been all season.  The Spurs responded though with a 10-0 run to start the second quarter against LAC’s notoriously lacking second unit, eventually taking the lead and bogging down the high-octane Clipper offense by hacking DeAndre Jordan (who shot 5-for-12 from the line).  But ignited by a loose-ball scrum between Baynes and Matt Barnes as well by an increased emphasis (sparked in part by the zest of the home crowd) on pushing the pace in transition that led to some of Griffin’s highlight reel plays, the Clippers put the Spurs away for good in the third quarter, seeing their lead balloon all the way to 18, before finishing with the final cushion of 15.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe usually calm, calculated Paul played with a sense of frenetic urgency, aggressively seeking out opportunities for himself and for others on offense, and raising the intensity level of the entire team on that end of the floor, while also playing bulldog defense on Tony Parker.  Griffin as well looked in prime shape, balancing out his development as a player from the perimeter with his classic tendencies to beeline for the rim and dunk on anybody that dare stand in his path (as Baynes could twice attest to).  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"376\" data-orig-height=\"501\"

same time remaining cautious of a multi-championship proven team with all sorts of experience in overcoming adversity.  “We had a good defensive night,” Rivers said.  “We have a lot of confidence in our team, but you just have to stay humble and respect who you’re playing.  They’re a heck of a basketball team.  We won one game.”  He also spoke highly of Griffin’s effort (“He got to the basket…he was just attacking”) as well as that of Jordan (“He changed shots, he was fantastic…He’s just so gifted athletically, so smart defensively”).  In summing up Game 1 and looking ahead to Game 2, Rivers put it well in saying that, “My belief is that we won tonight because we just had more energy.  For us to win on Wednesday night, we’re going to have to play better, and we’re going to have to execute better defensively.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpurs coach Gregg Popovich went on to sum things up by saying “The game was – their defense was better than our offense.  That’s the bottom line.  Their aggressiveness, their physicality, their athleticism, really hurt us offensively.”  Duncan echoed these sentiments saying “They were physical.  Their shot blockers in the back with DeAndre especially I think affected us at the basket.  We got off a lot of pretty decent shots that we usually would make.  But all in all, we give them a lot of credit because they stuck with what they were doing, got up in us, and made us do what we didn’t want to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGriffin, for his part, credited the win as a total team effort.  “We came out with great energy and made stops.  I tried to be aggressive.  I didn’t want to settle for any jump shots.  We tried to put pressure on them.”  He continued, “This was a great win but if we learned anything over the years in the Playoffs, it’d be that you have to finish it out.  This was one of four that we need, so we need to come out with the same mentality.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Clippers now hold a 1-0 lead in the best-of-seven first round series.  Game 2 is on Wednesday night at the Staples Center (10:30 PM EST/7:30 PM PST tip-off).  \u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Show Review: Shura @ The Echo (3/14/15)",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003eFrom the second I heard the opening kicks and claps of \u0026ldquo;Touch,\u0026rdquo; her single released last year, I knew that Shura was a name that I would hear over and over again in the near future. With her signature hushed vocals, throwback 80’s electro pop and 90’s R\u0026amp;B production, and tender, heartfelt lyrics, Shura has built a thunderous buzz around her with songs expertly crafted around the intimate murmur. She combines the best parts of Sade and Madonna, while keenly keeping an ear to hotly-tipped producers like Blood Orange and Jungle (who recently released a gloriously funky remix of her track, “Indecision\u0026quot;). The blend is mesmerizing, and there’s no doubt in my mind that Shura will make it big.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2448\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/303233692d66bd85855bcf90e6581885/tumblr_inline_nlsvdi1jyK1qhakxc_500.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2448\" data-orig-height=\"3264\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eHer set at The Echo entirely confirmed this. Shura grooved through her set with ease and confidence. Her stage presence was magnetic, which is thoroughly impressive for such a new artist. She had the crowd in the palm of her hand; shouts of “We love you Shura” were recurrent throughout her time onstage. The venue was perfect, too: small enough to create an intimate atmosphere, but large enough to handle bass-heavy electronic instrumentation that could easily translate in a stadium festival setting. She used the intimacy to her advantage and showcased two beautiful new tracks, both skeletal R\u0026amp;B slow jams in the vein of The xx. Her knack for rehashing potentially tacky 80s pop tropes with grace and virtuosity shined through on her rendition of Fine Young Cannibals’ “She Drives Me Crazy.” It’s a bold move to rework a song that cheesy, but Shura managed t transform it into a pillow-soft, heartbreaking declaration of addicting, but troublesome, love. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eIf there was one critique to be made, however, it would be about the length of her set. It was rather short, maybe no longer than twenty minutes, and I can’t help but feel a bit unfulfilled. Once she has a few more songs to her name, I’m sure she’ll be able to put up an incredible set of pop perfection. \u003cbr/\u003eWith a show this impressive, this early on in her career, it’s easy to forget she’s still a newbie. Perhaps the only true indicator of this was when she fumbled the lyrics to her new single, “2Shy.” But Shura handled that like a veteran, too, charmingly laughing it off and continuing on with the song. Shura’s live performance was an all-around success, and it’s clear that she is destined for bigger and better things in the upcoming year.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePhotos \u0026amp; Words: \u003ci\u003eGabriel Brenner\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Owa Helping His Stock at Pro Day",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003eBy Josh Naftulin\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e       In the introductory course on logic I attended during my sophomore year of college, a massive man would sit toward the front of the classroom each day with crutches by his side.  It was Owamagbe Odighizuwa, the promising young defender who was forced to miss the entire 2013 season while recovering from right hip surgery.  Fighting hard to rehab after his surgery, Owa was able to take redshirt for medical reasons.  It was uplifting to see him return at full health to have a monster year and earn himself second-team All Pac-12 Conference honors.At the NFL Combine just last month, Owa opened the eyes of many scouts with his outstanding build and clear physical ability.  A top performer for defensive linemen in the vertical jump, broad jump, 20-yard shuttle, 60-yard shuttle, and 40-yard dash, Owa cemented himself as a definite NFL-caliber player.  Owa even said in an interview that his play in the Senior Bowl sparked more intrigue from NFL personnel, but really it was his showing at the combine that has led to the increased amount of attention he has recently received.  With Owa having only six sacks this past season, however, NFL talent evaluators were interested in seeing more of his ability to rush to passer. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e        During UCLA’s Pro Day this past Tuesday, Owa was able to perform linebacker drills for NFL team scouts.  Apparently he did well, for his name has been highlighted by various media sources since the workout as one to watch as we approach the upcoming NFL Draft.  Although us Bruin fanatics are well aware of the disrupting presence Owa brings to the field and the rare combination of speed and athleticism he possesses, it appears the pro day was what the draft candidate needed to prove himself to NFL front office members.  Now, following the pro day, Owa has placed himself into the discussion of being a possible late-first round draft pick.  A defensive team captain this year, Owa not only contains the skill to play at the next level but also the type of attitude that will allow him to excel in the pros. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e        In an interview with Mike Mayock at the pro day (which you can view here), Mora described Owa as a “specialist” who is likely best-suited as a defensive end at the next level, but also as someone who may be able to make a smooth transition to outside linebacker. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e         As we move closer to draft day, it will be imperative for Owa’s stock that NFL evaluators see him as being able to make that positional change.  For if many see him as a true defensive end, Owa will likely be plagued by a perceived lack of versatility.  It is always fun to see former Bruins continue pursuing their dreams as professional football players because in the end, they’ll always be one of our Bruins.  Having personally met him in class and witnessed his road to recovery, I’ll be excited to see him suit up for whichever NFL team lands him.  No matter where he ends up, Owa will be out to prove all his doubters wrong and Bruin supporters everywhere should be cheering for him all along the way.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

UCLA has had a very interesting year when it comes to Men’s Basketball.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey struggled very early, but have come out near the end of the season to show that they can still contend. This is exactly how the game unfolded too. Tony Parker slept in and showed up late to warm ups. Thus, he lost his starting position and was benched. From the beginning, UCLA seemed to not have it going for them. This was only truer when the halftime whistle came. WSU was up 34-32. Their 3-pointers were raining from the sky and only a 9-4 run by UCLA right before the half could get them back in the game. It all came down to the second half.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUCLA ended up outscoring WSU 40-33 in the second half to bring home the W by 5 points. Powell scored a career high of 28 points to bring the Bruins the victory. Even when losing the starting position, Parker came in to score 15 points and get 10 rebounds. Alford again had plenty of steals with 4 this game.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the end, UCLA pulled out another second half minor comeback. Althoughthe year has been very up-and-down for UCLA basketball, there is hope and promise for the team. They rally and they comeback. Even after losing three starters in the NBA draft last year, UCLA has shown that they can compete with forces working against them. Now, with this W over WSU, they hold the fourth spot in the PAC-12 coming up on their rival game against USC. They are in position to hold a good spot in the PAC-12 tournament and while simultaneously continuing to grow. The next month and year will be very interesting with high-stakes for UCLA Basketball.\u003c/p\u003e",

However when heisman hopeful, Brett Hundley, went down with an injury in the first quarter, the stage was set for the red shirt sophomore son of former UCLA head coach and Quarterback, Rick Neuheisel. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;I just thought, Wow. You couldn\u0026rsquo;t write a better script than this right here,” coach Jim Mora said. “His dad was a great player here. For him to come to Texas and bringing his team from behind to get a win. It\u0026rsquo;s incredible. It\u0026rsquo;s awesome.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003eNeuheisel would go on to complete 23 of 30 attempts for 178 yards and two touchdowns, including a game winning 33-yard dime to Jordan Payton with just 3 minutes to go. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;It took until I got in the locker room and we did the fight song that it really sank in,\u0026rdquo; Neuheisel said. \u0026ldquo;Right now I\u0026rsquo;m just kind of on cloud nine and enjoying the moment.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003eThe Bruins had their work cut out for them in facing off against Tyrone Swoopes. The Longhorns QB showed flashes of brilliance en route to 196 yards and 2 TDs. Texas did however, give UCLA a huge break to start the game. After deferring their choice to the second half, the Bruins still received the ball first. Texas had mistakenly chosen to play defense to start, a blunder that gave UCLA a free possession.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003eHundley injured his non throwing elbow at the end of an 11 yard scamper on the Bruins’ second possession of the game. The incumbent QB fell awkwardly, appearing to hyperextend his elbow while attempting to break his fall. Though Hundley wanted to get back into the game, the UCLA coaching staff decided to keep him on the sidelines. He is expected to undergo an MRI on Monday.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003eDown 3-10 to start the second half, Neuheisel engineered a 7 play 75 yard drive which culminated in the first touchdown pass of his career. A 25 yd field goal from Ka’imi Fairbairn later gave the Bruins their second lead of the night, before Swoopes connected with John Harris late in the contest to make it 13-17. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003eA Jordan James fumble with 5 minutes left, looked like a potential dagger to the Bruins’ hopes of a story book ending. The defense stood tall though, forcing a 3 and out that led to a 58 yard punt return by Ishmael Adams. With the ball just 33 yards away from pay dirt, and a little more than 3 minutes left on the clock, Neuheisel took over. It took just one play for the backup to deliver. Neuheisel took the snap and pumped once before launching a perfect pass to Payton for the winning touchdown.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003ePaul Perkins was also excellent for the Bruins, rushing for 126 yards on 24 carries and adding an additional 69 yards on 5 receptions. UCLA (3-0) is back in action Sept. 25th when they face off against divisional foe, Arizona State. The Sun Devils (3-0) got the best of UCLA last season in the Rose Bowl, and a loss by USC this past saturday makes the match-up all the more significant for PAC-12 south supremacy.\u003c/p\u003e",

Two of the original four left after their second album \u003cem\u003eBelong\u003c/em\u003e, causing vocalist and songwriter Kip Berman to regroup and retreat a bit from the ambitious sound of their previous effort. Known for their inspired sound similar to indie favorites like My Bloody Valentine, Belle and Sebastian, and The Smiths, The Pains continue blending classic pop structures with their own contemporary indie-ness on \u003cem\u003eDays of Abandon\u003c/em\u003e. The result is a distinctly pleasant album. From start to finish, the Pains croon and jangle to sweet melodies and pop textures. Though never challenging, the album nonetheless presents catchy tunes sure to elicit foot taps and hums from anyone who can dig bright (but never blinding) indie pop. Berman’s lyrics are lively and personal, some noticeably heartfelt, others rather cliché, but all match the tone of the songs. A Sunny Day in Glasgow’s Jen Goma sings backing vocals and also takes the lead on two tracks, complementing Berman with her pure, clear voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe Pains may have retreated a little too far into their pop haven, however, as numerous tracks lack musical substance. The sound is safer and more predictable than their previous two albums, which some listeners may appreciate. I was most impressed by the album on the first listen, but each subsequent spin left me searching for more. Like those sugary heart candies on Valentine’s day, \u003c/span\u003e\u003cem\u003eDays of Abandon\u003c/em\u003e goes down easy and makes you smile, but does little more than fizzle once ingested. The Pains certainly don’t lack talent or energy, so the absence of flair is likely attributed to the struggles of lineup changes and finding that spark again. A sucker for jangly guitars myself, I hope they return with the ambition that makes them so pure and enjoyable to listen to. Still, there are a few gems that makes this album worth checking out for fans of The Pains and light, sprightly indie pop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRecommended Tracks:\u003c/strong\u003e Art Smock, Masokissed, Life After Life\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGRADE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e 7/10\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

In fact, it sounds like perhaps The Horrors got tired of shows where fans “would get too silly” and the floor would collapse, trading that energy in favor of something that would appeal to people walking past them at a festival. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"Apple-tab-span\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e“Chasing Shadows” is a mellow opening track, but builds on itself as the track continues, eventually building up enough momentum to serve as a solid introduction to the rest of the album. \u003cem\u003eLuminous \u003c/em\u003eseems to be about relationships - a far cry from earlier tracks like “Sheena is a Parasite,” which recalls an alien creature (Chris Cunningham did the music \u003ca href=\"http://vimeo.com/72604388\" title=\"Sheena is a parasite\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evideo\u003c/a\u003e): “Jealous Sun” admonishes that “your love is not enough” while “Change Your Mind” cries for a romantic entanglement (“Hey I’m still burning/Would you ever leave him for me/Hey I’m still burning/Do you look at him the way she looks at me?”).

Separatist leaders in those regions are asking to join Russia. Russia’s thinking about it, but in a few months’ time, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a larger Russian Federation. The EU and particularly the U.S. are freaking out. They have been doing so since Crimea voiced similar desires. The rhetoric has escalated despite the U.S., EU, and Russia all condemning violence and political aggression. Why? Specifically, why the U.S.?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis seems to be a game of I, Me, Mine. Both the EU and Russia have very real economic interests in Ukraine. The recent Ukrainian unrest began with disputes over a trade deal between the two parties months ago. The U.S., on the other hand, has a very real interest in not letting Russia get what it wants. As a citizen, especially one who never lived during the Cold War, I ask if this interest is legitimate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI claim no expertise on the situation, but it appears to me that our actions are excessive and self-absorbed. Far too many have already died over political squabbles. The Ukranian people have a voice and a will. It is not outsiders’ position to manipulate or denounce its legitimacy simply because the conniving Russians have interests in the situation. U.S. foreign policy is not the puppet master that it used to be. Our leaders must recognize this limitation and deescalate like it’s 1991.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurther reading: \u003ca href=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303851804579557270886987190?mg=reno64-wsj\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWall Street Journal\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

His worldly presence is something of a mystery: try to search for him and all you’ll find is a rather vacant Facebook page and an even more vacant MySpace page (also, does anybody know how to use MySpace anymore?) It’s interesting, then, that Pinata mirrors Tribu Ultravioleta’s own mystery. Ultimately, however, I’m willing to break with how the artist describes himself, and call it a disco album.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s true that mysterious undertones and disco are not generally accompanied by one another, yet there is no way to ignore the heavy dark undertones in the tracks. They are found within the timbre of the music, which seemed to resonate frequently at lower levels. These dark and somewhat inaccessible undertones draw the listener in and provoke in them some consideration. This consideration, I feel, adds an incredible level to the disco overtones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd there’s no escaping that this is, at it’s core, a disco album. Some say disco died, but this second wave of disco that is characterized by artist such as Tribu Ultravioleta and Daft Punk is notably more worthwhile than the first incarnation. Due in part to the mysterious undertones which are added,and were added equally in the newest Daft Punk album, the disco has a new textured depth to it that makes it listenable outside of the discotheque.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, I really enjoyed this album.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecommended Tracks: Flying, Te Veo, Pinata.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGRADE: \u003c/strong\u003e7/10\u003c/p\u003e",

Since then I grew into a full-fledged fanatic. I live and die by my team. I rarely miss watching my NFL team play and I spend the entire game jumping, cursing, and sometimes, if we lose, crying. Whenever I mention my obsession people are surprised since I am a girl. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my 12 years as a football fanatic it has been a fact that the NFL world is not female friendly. I have just grown to accept it. I love the sport and I love proving to the guys that I am just as valuable of a fan as them. I thought that this sexism came from ignorance, until this week. As anybody that follows any sort of news knows, the video of Baltimore Raven’s Ray Rice punching his fiancé Janay Palmer unconscious was released this week.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe altercation occurred in February and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Rice for a laughable two games. The Ravens even held a press conference about the incident with Rice and his new wife. Not once did Rice apologize to Palmer. The Ravens even tweeted after that Palmer apologized for her role. After months of public outrage the NFL crafted a stricter policy against domestic violence. This seemed to placate most people and the focus shifted to the beginning of a new season. Then when Rice is preparing to play in his first game after suspension, TMZ released a video showing Rice punch Palmer and her falling to the ground unconscious and him dragging her limp body out of the elevator. Within hours Rice was cut from the Ravens and was suspended from the NFL indefinitely. Goodell claimed he had never seen this second tape and even sent a letter to all NFL coaches describing the steps he took to try to procure the tape from New Jersey Police. New Jersey Police says they did send the tape to NFL executives. Currently former FBI director Robert Mueller will investigate how the league handled the Rice affair.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am now told I should boycott the NFL or I am a hypocrite that does not respect myself. Ray Rice’s actions and the aftermath sicken me. There is no excuse for a man to ever hit a woman, especially when that man is twice her size and is a professional athlete. There is also no excuse for the NFL and the Ravens to try to cover it up. 44% of football fans are women and it is atrocious for the league to disregard them like this. The sexism that I always tried to conquer is not just boys being ignorant, but instead is institutional. I do not want to just give up on the NFL, because it is flawed. I want to be a part of the solution. When these issues come up (and sadly they do often) I want to be there to push for changes to be made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is hope in the NFL. Many players and ESPN commentators have condemned Goodell, Rice, and the NFL in general for how they handled this. I do not want to abandon football instead I want to call on the NFL to fire commissioner Roger Goodell and force Steve Bisciotti, owner of the Ravens, to sell the team. This story can go from “the darkest week in the history of the league” to the opening of a dialogue on sexism in sports, domestic violence, and even player accountability. Again I am going to choose to rise above it and keep hoping that the sport I love will start meeting my expectations.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003eLast Thursday I had the pleasure of seeing the fantastic musical comedian Tim Minchin, at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre.  As I approached the historical venue that blends very well into a quiet area near Koreatown, the first thing I noticed was the crowd gathered outside: a collection of middle aged pony-tailed men, punky teenagers, nerdy college students, and classy old people. An interesting bunch for an oddball artist.  There was also $1 coffee, tea, and hot cocoa, so the Ebell immediately won my love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"http://cdn1.timminchin.com/wp-content/uploads/Rekha_2.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eAfter the full house was seated, the show began.  His entrance onto the stage immediately sent red flags to the audience that “yes, this show is going to make you laugh extremely hard so I hoped you all used the little spectator’s room.”  Mr. Minchin, holding his glass of red wine, strode out onto the stage, wearing his usual all black attire, heavy eyeliner, and sporting mad scientist-like red hair.  He announced that it was his first live show in 2 years, and gave a disclaimer that he didn’t know what was going to happen that night.  Although he stumbled with lyrics a few times, he was always met with laughter and applause, which he responded to with “Fuck You!” in his twangy Australian accent.  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eHis subjects ranged from the struggles of being ginger (“Prejudice”), to atheism (“Thank You God”) to love (“If I Didn’t Have You”).  At some concerts, I tend to daze of for a bit, listening to the music but zoning out and not being truly present.  However throughout his set I clung to every word, because everything he said and sang was pure gold.  One of his last songs was “Dark Side,” a lengthy ballad which discusses how he responds when a girl tells him he’s lacking emotional depth because of his consistently happy manner.  During the song he hardcore solo’d all over the grand, improvising for about 5 minutes and even sneaking in a quick “Fur Elise” reference.  By the climax he already had us in stitches, but nearly killed everyone at the last chorus by turning on a wind machine to majestically blow his hair.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eThree encores later, he bid us goodnight, and everyone filed out of the theatre with a smile on their face. \u003c/div\u003e",

A cursory glance at their Wikipedia page shows that their top single was on heavy rotation on Starbucks playlists around the world. And honestly, that is the best way to describe their music. It is exactly what one would expect to listen to in a coffee shop or other relaxing public atmosphere. Nothing in the album is hectic or chaotic. Everything resembles the calm, yet bustling nature of a coffee shop. The sounds themselves are relatively vanilla with a traditional format of female singer plus drums, bass, and guitar. Nothing here will surprise or deviate from the norm of indie rock.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot to say that that’s a bad thing however. Indie rock can still be good indie rock if it is executed well, and in this case it is. The structure may be lacking in inspiration, but the melodies and songs themselves are quite good. It’s just that the band itself sounds so similar to anything else one would find in a Barnes and Nobles, Starbucks, American Eagle, or other public shopping area. It’s not the type of music that would perk your ears and make you wonder who this is. It’s just background music for another activity that’s probably taking up more of your mental space, which is a shame because the songwriting talent is clearly there.

The group, hailing from Brentwood, California (the NorCal Brentwood), consists of a trio of high school friends who came together to create an indie rock album consisting of elements taken from a range of genres, including punk rock and dream pop. The album\u0026rsquo;s cohesive component is the dreaminess present in all the songs, which is found mainly in the echoing voice of the lead singer, who differs throughout the tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe album starts off with an upbeat song, “King of the Road,” to showcase the many diverse elements the band members bring together. The echoing and unclear singing and lyrics of the chorus creates a mystical, psychedelic vibe leading the listener into a dreamy mode. The album continues on and in the fourth track, “Handsome,” strongly establishes the dreaminess factor. The lead singer in this track appears to be Melina Duterte, whose soft voice creates a mellow feeling and peaceful feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most notable song of the album is the eighth track, “Maxine.” The synth pop, the feel-good rhythm, and the combination of the soft voice of the girl with the deeper guy voice makes for a fun and dreamy song. It stands out in comparison to all the other songs, and is the perfect way to transition into the last track “Golden Age,” a slow, soft song reminiscent of the entire album and a beautiful way to end.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis album is the perfect soundtrack for a chill, mellow spring day at the beach or a park. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed it and found myself feeling mellow and relaxed after listening to it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGRADE: \u003c/strong\u003e8/10\u003c/p\u003e",

It\u0026rsquo;s the year he released the album \u003cem\u003ePurple Rain\u003c/em\u003e, which would become the soundtrack to the movie of the same name. But \u0026ldquo;When Doves Cry\u0026rdquo; was also a huge hit for Prince.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0026rsquo;s interesting about this artist is his ability to combine so many different genres of music. He\u0026rsquo;s impossible to classify, with a strange, alien-like style and a sound that mixes everything from jazz to folk to soul. Yeah, this makes him easy to feel uncomfortable around—I think that anyone who makes fun of Prince is really just unable to \u0026ldquo;get\u0026rdquo; him—but it also makes him incredibly exciting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMay 15th, 1985, he released \u0026ldquo;Raspberry Beret,\u0026rdquo; a date which also falls under this week. Maybe this is just Prince\u0026rsquo;s favorite week in May, or something. Or, more likely, it\u0026rsquo;s coincidence. But it\u0026rsquo;s a great excuse to turn this into a Prince Appreciation Post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026rsquo;s really never been a performer as enigmatic and ethereal as Prince is. I\u0026rsquo;ve never seen him live, but I\u0026rsquo;ve seen him on older episodes of \u003cem\u003eSaturday Night Live\u003c/em\u003e (and there\u0026rsquo;s, of course, \u003cem\u003ePurple Rain\u003c/em\u003e), and he\u0026rsquo;s so addictively watchable. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, take this opportunity to listen to some Prince this week!\u003c/p\u003e",

If all of our ice were to melt suddenly, sea levels worldwide would rise by more than 200 feet. According to two new research papers (from \u003cem\u003eScience\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eGeophysical Research Letters\u003c/em\u003e) some major glaciers in the West Antarctic Ice sheet are goners, and, according to the researchers (who, by the way, work for NASA so you know they’re legit) the glaciers’ collapse seems unstoppable. The researchers also believe that the collapse will probably affect adjacent glaciers as well, creating a domino effect for the majority of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what does that mean? Well, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet contains enough water to raise sea levels by 13 feet. That’s a dramatically different planet. To give you an idea, 99.5% of the population of Louisiana would be submerged and 30% of all homes in Florida would be underwater.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe West Antarctic Ice Sheet research comes on the heels of the most recent National Climate Assessment, which concluded that climate change, once a far-off notion, is already affecting our weather patterns: extreme heat waves, droughts, and torrential rains are just some of the results of the average 2 degrees Fahrenheit increase in temperature over the last century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe latest climate change research is simply screaming at us to pay attention, and yet, we treat the warming of our world as an afterthought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, to sum up, oh shit. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurther reading: \u003ca href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2014/05/west-antarctic-ice-sheet-collapse\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMother Jones\u003c/a\u003e; \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/07/science/earth/climate-change-report.html?_r=1\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNew York Times\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

This week\u0026rsquo;s topic is an album that was released May 10, 1994—\u003cem\u003etwenty years ago!—\u003c/em\u003eWeezer's \u003cem\u003eWeezer\u003c/em\u003e, which is universally referred to as \u0026ldquo;The Blue Album.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWeezer\u0026rsquo;s first real album, it features most of their most beloved songs, like \u0026ldquo;Say It Ain\u0026rsquo;t So,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Undone—The Sweater Song,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Buddy Holly.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eRolling Stone \u003c/em\u003elisted it as #35 on their \u0026ldquo;100 Greatest Albums of All Time\u0026rdquo; list, saying that it mixes \u0026ldquo;winking deadpan delivery with serious hooks, guarded sensitivity and a deep disinterest in alt-rock\u0026rsquo;s then-roiling culture wars.\u0026rdquo; And that\u0026rsquo;s pretty accurate. Because The Blue Album is at once completely silly, non-serious pop rock, and intensely emotional sad-boy indie. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s also, and this is very rare, an amusing album. With lines like \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rsquo;s with these homies dissin\u0026rsquo; my girl,\u0026rdquo; you can tell that Rivers Cuomo doesn\u0026rsquo;t totally take himself too serious. (His Facebook page, by the way, is pure gold, with posts like, \u0026ldquo;I know they\u0026rsquo;re not doing it for my benefit, but I want to thank the birds for singing so sweetly every morning\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;It doesn\u0026rsquo;t take a lot of introspection to realize you don\u0026rsquo;t exist. I mean, really, he\u0026rsquo;s as good at Facebook as Ezra Koenig and David Lynch are at Twitter.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, you have the fun of something like \u0026quot;Buddy Holly,\u0026rdquo; and then the tragic emotional breakdown/relationship breakup of \u0026ldquo;Say It Ain\u0026rsquo;t So,\u0026rdquo; right on the same album. It\u0026rsquo;s quirky genius, basically.\u003c/p\u003e",

I had no idea the station existed, but at a tUnE-yArDs concert I met our New Media manager Melina. Trying to avoid another girl at the concert, I talked about radio with her, liked what I heard, and signed up for an interview. The appeal was really just finding a friend group at that point, and the common denominator of good music was just a cherry on top.\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What do you like best about UCLA Radio now that you have been a part of it for a while and become a manager and very involved member?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eA: The things I like most about the station have shifted around quite a bit since I’ve been a manager. When I first joined, my favorite part of radio was the openness with which radio operated: there wasn’t a strict hierarchy or clique mentality, it was just a group of really nice and accessible managers trying to make something awesome. As I got to know managers and DJs, that openness transformed into community, and I honestly think our DJ community is the absolute highlight of our presence on campus and sets us apart from most UCLA groups. More recently though, I’ve begun to appreciate how amazing our programming is. I used to think NPR and KCRW were the kings of unique programming, but our station’s genre variety and creativity in show themes just absolutely trumps them all. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that UCLA Radio is doing things that no station is doing on-air — we are really the most unique station there is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What is one band you like to play on your show that doesn’t always fit the show’s theme perfectly but you make space for because they mean something special to you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eA: Thankfully, with Thought For Food, I don’t restrict myself to any one genre or theme, so it gives me a lot of leeway with the music I play. However, there have definitely been a couple of trends in my playlists so far this year that don’t have much to do with what I talk about on air. The first one of these is the work of William Onyeabor, who is this Nigerian afro-funk artist from the 1980s who makes these towering synth-based dance songs that groove immeasurably hard for what seems like ages. David Byrne’s label Luaka Bop just came out with a compilation of his work last year, and I’ve played at least one track off of that LP every week simply because it makes people dance. Which is very important to me as a DJ — ideally my show makes you think and dance multiple times over the span of an hour. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eOn a more thoughtful note, I’ve definitely included a lot of The Beta Band on my playlists this quarter. Their music is rather undefinable and shambolic, floating between psychedlica, electronica and Brit-pop, all of which are not personal faves nor genres I expect much deep meaning in. But somehow I find that their music really matches Though For Food’s sensibility and purpose. For example, I rarely plan any theme to my shows, letting myself just pick things I feel like reading or songs that make sense in terms of tone or tempo. It’s all very arbitrary, but over the course of actually doing the show, I find myself realizing exactly why I chose one song over another or why I chose to play a Simpsons clip over a Spongebob one. It’s not necessarily that these realizations bring with them any sort of meaning, but more than it brings a bit of self-awareness and satisfaction into an arbitrary environment. I think The Beta Band’s music reflects that sentiment perfectly, and the sort of quiet realizations that their music inscribes matches the sort of casual, “huh, cool” wisdom that I intend Thought For Food to have even if that wisdom never explicitly presents itself.\u003c/p\u003e",

Only after USC received many phone calls questioning the incident did Shaw admit that he had fabricated the story. \u0026ldquo;We are extremely disappointed in Josh,\u0026rdquo; said USC head football coach Steve Sarkisian. \u0026ldquo;He let us all down.” USC touted Shaw\u0026rsquo;s heroism on its website and posted a link to the story on Twitter.

Shaw’s fate with the team now hangs in a balance, as does USC’s football season. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis incident would be enough to derail USC’s football program as they prepared to face Saturday’s opening game against Fresno, but they also had to deal with allegations from senior cornerback Andrew Brown. Brown claims that Steve Sarkisian is a racist, which caused him to quit the team. Brown quit the team a weak ago and this past Thursday he posted on Instagram, \u0026quot;Sark treated me like a slave in his Office\u0026hellip;Can\u0026rsquo;t play for a racist MAN!!!!! #Fighton.” Sarkisian was \u0026quot;shocked\u0026rdquo; and said these claims are “ridiculous”. The posts were later removed. According to Sarkisian Brown quit the team after he was moved from cornerback to running back. Brown has faced numerous injuries in the past two years and only played in two games last season. Many players have come out in defense of Sarkisian, including former USC quarterback Matt Leinart. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese off the field controversies leave many with numerous questions and very little answers. The biggest, how can USC play a successful season with both the team’s captain and their coach being brought into question? USC was able to win their first game against Fresno State 52-13, which has brought some optimism to USC\u0026rsquo;s situation.\u003c/p\u003e",

As the leading track, it gives the impression that the album will be based around a melancholic atmosphere with hushed vocals and moody guitar work. The next several tracks confirm this paradigm, but with their fourth song “Like a Kid”, the band suddenly transitions into an anthem-like track where the tone changes drastically to one of supreme confidence and loudness. It is this flexibility that is both The Trouble with Templeton’s strength and downfall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite this variety and the transitions, The Trouble with Templeton are still able to sound like themselves. They retain their identity throughout each of the songs and are able to carve out a unique sense of who they are with each of their songs. However, while they are able to write songs of varying styles, how well each of the songs is written is a different matter. It is clear that The Trouble with Templeton prefer to stick with the hazy tone of their earlier songs as these songs make up the majority of the album. And with good reason: while the attempt to mix things up once in a while is admirable, it becomes increasingly evident that The Trouble with Templeton are better suited to this slower style, especially with their fondness of using guitar and vocal effects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem with Rookie as an album is that it feels like the band is still trying to find their own sound (which is slightly fitting with their album name). The album might still be worth listening to, but it would probably be worth waiting until the band matures more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRecommended Tracks:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eWhimpering Child, Flowers in Bloom\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGRADE:\u003c/strong\u003e 6.5/10\u003c/p\u003e",

Through lead singer Tim Beeler’s powerful Julian Casablancas/Thurston Moore voice, the audience can hear the strong imitation of the capitalistic United States. Beeler’s voice, along with the instrumental, can also present a lost soul waiting for something to happen in their lives so that they won’t have to live with political issues or societal conflicts and suffer with the consequences. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"Apple-tab-span\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003eThe album \u003cem\u003eMore Than Any Other Day\u003c/em\u003e is basically a mixture of the greats such as Violent Femmes, Sonic Youth, Nirvana and Julian Casablancas. This is because Beeler sings almost like Gordan Gano and when he hits higher notes, his voice is almost like Casablancas\u0026rsquo; higher registered singing. Beeler has the attitude of Kurt Cobain during the songs and as for the instrumental, it has a little grunge along with the day-dream sense like Sonic Youth. In some parts of the album, Beeler comes out with conversational-styled singing that follows up with outbursts of higher registered singing and louder, extravagant instrumentals. These eight tracks can take one through a journey of grunge, political activism and awareness, angered dissatisfaction and a nostalgic mixture of famous artists from the mid-90s.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGRADE: \u003c/strong\u003e9/10\u003c/p\u003e",

It involves the costs of internet providers and the discrepancy between fast and slower internet service to be charged at different rates. Because it would need to gain some control over internet traffic in order to differentiate the internet “speeds,” the proposed regulation of this issue would inadvertently cause the FCC to gain some control over content put on the internet. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn response, \u003ca href=\"http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-wga-showrunners-fcc-20140513-story.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis article\u003c/a\u003e was published in the LA Times the next day describing some of the immediate retaliation against the proposition.

The letter states, “The open Internet is the greatest technological catalyst to participatory democracy and free speech since the printing press.” Already, concern for what this action could have on the raw integrity of internet content is developing. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo decisive action has been taken by Wheeler and the FCC yet, but it is probably good to keep informed on the situation as it affects us UCLA Radio members and millions of others just like us.\u003c/p\u003e",

Some tracks portray an influence of some high-key groups such as Chromeo and Bag Raiders. Another positive point of RAC’s new music is that a lot of artists are featured on their album such as Tegan and Sara, Tokyo Police Club, Matthew Coma, Katie Herzig, YACHT, St. Lucia, Peter Morén, Karl Kling, Pink Feathers, Alex Ebert, Penguin Prison, Body Language, Kele and MNDR. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"Apple-tab-span\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cem\u003eStrangers\u003c/em\u003e is reminiscent of when things were fun and easy like a modernized Brady Bunch show. Picture an Old Navy or Target photoshoot at a beach with all smiles or a happy drive to the local fair; you have pictured the correct vision of this album. It is very uplifting with its synth pop sounds along with its drum machine samplings. Not only do the sounds of this album portray the greener grass of the other side but the lyrics do as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"Apple-tab-span\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003eTheir most famous single is the first track of the album, which is “Let Go”. The lyrics are uplifting and attempting to help a friend which gives the audience a soft spot for the group. The song gives a positive message to their listeners such as their song “Hard to Hold” featuring Tegan and Sara. It talks about how a person is hard to hold onto and that person does not care. Tegan and Sara then sing that the person does not deserve their love. Aside from the poppy sounds, one song hits the spot with a more serious aspect, which is “We Belong” featuring Katie Herzig. The song takes a slower pace than the other songs and transitions to another side of the group’s face.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecommended Tracks: Let Go, Hollywood, Hard to Hold, 405, We Belong\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGRADE: \u003c/strong\u003e7/10\u003c/p\u003e",

While I sat through the program for the entirety of the five hours comprising it, the couple in front of me hastily departed after only the first portion. One might assume that they were expecting something similar to Glass’s soundtracks for \u003cem\u003eThe Truman Show\u003c/em\u003e or\u003cem\u003e Candyman\u003c/em\u003e. Given the pigeonholing of Glass by amateur film connoisseurs as “the weird soundtrack guy”, this is both plausible. It is also unfortunate, because “Music In 12 Parts” is one of Glass’s crowning achievements, easily on par with his 1976 opera \u003cem\u003eEinstein On The Beach \u003c/em\u003eand his soundtrack to 1982’s \u003cem\u003eKoyaanisqatsi\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs indicated by the name, the piece is composed of twelve individual parts, which were bundled by threes into single segments, for a total of four 50-minute portions. However, there were intermissions after each portion and an hour-long dinner break was held after the second portion, so endurance was hardly an issue. In typical Glass fashion, the portions started abruptly and ended in a similar manner. Far from being disconcerting, this was a testament to the skill of the Ensemble to ensure that the three keyboards, the flute, the bassoon, the voice of Lisa Bielawa and, occasionally, the saxophone were able to play in perfect harmony off the top. Bielawa, the sole vocalist, deserves special mention in particular. Having listened extensively to \u003cem\u003eEinstein on The Beach\u003c/em\u003e, I expected a whole chorus to perform the vocal parts at this concert. Instead, Bielawa magnificently sang all the vocal portions and perfectly alternated between the soothing melodies and ominous crescendos the piece dictated, at times rivaling the most apocalyptic moments of \u003cem\u003eEinstein\u003c/em\u003e. This was most apparent in Part 12 of the composition where, in very small increments, her part grew more complex each time the rest of the Ensemble played the same musical passage. It is also worth mentioning that Part 12 was my favorite part of the concert.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, the keyboard players drew my attention as well. Philip Glass may be the heart and soul of the Ensemble, but it seemed that in this concert, keyboardist Michael Riesman did most of the heavy lifting, playing some truly captivating organ passages throughout. This is hardly an indictment of Glass, however. Far from it, it’s quite possible that he simply deigned to play the more subdued keyboard parts. Not that I would guess that simply by watching him. Indeed, while the other players sat still and appeared collected, Glass made no effort to conceal his passion for the music, lurching forward and throwing himself back before lurching forward again, in a manner as cyclic as his music. He really felt it that night, and the audience, including this writer, did too, because it granted the Ensemble a standing ovation when Part 12 of “Music In 12 Parts”, after five hours, finally concluded. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWritten by Reggie\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/40DJqyu.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy: Taylor Whelchel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFennec is an enigmatic new presence in the music industry. If you wanted to find out more about him by checking out wikipedia or his various social media accounts, you’d find yourself coming up empty-handed. Named for the adorable fennec fox that’s native to western Africa (which sheds light on why his various profiles list his location as “Western Sahara”), Fennec himself is a college grad based in United States who got his start DJing club nights and house parties during his undergrad years. We also gleaned from his twitter that he loves Taylor Swift (listen to “Woke Up Feeling Disconnected” off his debut LP for what is possibly a distorted vocal sample from Swift’s country-pop “Love Story”), but that’s about all there is in the manner or biographical facts. Fennec’s online persona is mysterious, comedic, and charmingly egomaniacal in unequal parts. But his boastful attitude is justifiably backed up by the maturity of his unique sound, crafted with artistry and precision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e Following shortly behind the early 2014 release of his debut LP, \u003cem\u003eLet Your Heart Break, \u003c/em\u003e-which boasts 15 seamless, pulsating tracks- Fennec returns with a new four-track EP, entitled \u003cem\u003eBeloved. \u003c/em\u003eHis brand of sample-based beats beckons fans of pop, hip-hop and electronic alike and defies the simplicity of genre classifications, which makes this review challenging to write. Where \u003cem\u003eLet Your Heart Break \u003c/em\u003ewas melancholic pop of varied pace, Beloved, to me, calls more upon house influences. Particularly apparent in “Fall” with the removals and subsequent reprisals of the bassline, it stirs the listener into motion; I find myself swaying and tapping my foot as each song builds. Both “Fall” and “Wraith” exemplify the gritty groove that make a crowd move at any electronic show, but this short EP is anything but one-note. Where almost-abrasive beats are championed in the middle section of the record, the final track opens up into a lush and expansive melody with such purity of sound that it seems to smooth over that abrasive edge of the previous tracks. There’s something soothing about “Blue Spray Jacket,” despite its entirely danceable beat, that leaves me feeling like I’ve spent a day at a spa rather than listening to an electronic album.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e The feature that permeates all of Fennec’s music is the artful layering of percussion, melody, and samples - which range from spoken and sung words to laughter and ambient sound - that together yield a signature complexity of sound. That signature is unparalleled and inimitable, and it’s a huge part of what makes \u003cem\u003eBeloved \u003c/em\u003esuch a compelling sophomore effort from Fennec: one that leaves me wanting more in the best way. In the concluding seconds of this fantastic record, we hear an isolated vocal sample: “I’m just waiting for my time\u0026hellip;because when it’s my time, I’m taking it over”. If you ask me, Fennec’s time is soon upon us, and I’m looking forward to it. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRecommended Tracks: \u003c/strong\u003eFall, Blue Spray Jacket\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRating: \u003c/strong\u003e9/10\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

The conflict began in May when China’s state-owned oil company, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, installed an oil-rig in territories that both Vietnam and China claim rights to. The Vietnamese consider the offending rig’s installation to be a violation of international law because it believes the territory to be theirs, while China claims the territory as part of its “continental shelf” and sees the installation of the rig as an avenue to advance its geopolitical agenda. China’s escort and installation of the rig, which was escorted by naval ships, has provoked Vietnam to move several of its own boats as buffers, creating a tense situation that has been exacerbated by the sinking of a Vietnamese fishing ship by a Chinese equivalent. On the domestic front, angry Vietnamese protestors attacked Chinese businesses in Vietnam, “smashing down gates and setting fire to businesses, attacking anything deemed to be of Chinese origin…” These developments have strained the relationship between the two countries; however, the result may very well end in China’s benefit because an armed conflict is unlikely – it is irrational for both to engage in violence – leaving the bargaining range to consist of economic affairs. China’s economy is vastly superior to that of Vietnam’s and since Vietnam relies heavily on foreign investment, Vietnam will eventually have to yield to a less-than-favorable agreement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFurther reading: \u003ca href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2014/05/19/world/asia/china-vietnam-islands-oil-rig-explainer/index.html?hpt=ismore\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCNN International\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

I’ve listened to it a few times now, and I can’t say I know much more. He’s played in Little Joy, Los Hermanos and with Devendra Banhart, he’s from Brazil, is thirty-seven years old, and that’s nearly it. But his new album, out now, is an introduction in itself, and a really great one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCavalo \u003c/em\u003eis an album made up of delicate skeletons made out of nylon string guitars, horn sections, shakers, chiming pianos, sung in English, Portuguese, French. “Irene” makes me think about Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast At Tiffany’s: it’s full of New York summer heat and the smell of tamales and tar and minor 7ths, and it makes me want to learn Portuguese in all its four thousand irregular verbs. “Hourglass” runs on a steady engine of motorik Fender bass, digital chirps, and 16-bit horns. But elsewhere, \u003cem\u003eCavalo \u003c/em\u003eis full of notes of alarm, like “Mon Nom,” which starts out with the words “I am the stranger,” sung in ambiguous French, underlaid by a nervously plucked piece of classical guitar, orchestral sounds out of 60\u0026rsquo;s Italian thriller movies and subterranean stabs of synthesizer. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eThe cover, with Amarante’s trilingual lyrics on a stark white background, nothing but the music inside, reminds me of another, even more stripped down album by Mt. Eerie, which Phil Elverum wrote and recorded in a remote Norwegian cabin. Like Mt. Eerie’s \u003cem\u003eDawn, Cavalo \u003c/em\u003eis an album (in Amarante’s own words) about the solitude of the lonesome traveler, and that’s definitely clear in an album that’s as paranoid as it is hopeful, as lamenting as it is plain cool. But don’t let that turn you off, because \u003cem\u003eCavalo’s \u003c/em\u003emelancholy and reflectiveness never boils over, and for every “Mon Nom” and “Fall Asleep” (filled with chiming, cavernous pianos and slowly lilting lyrics), there’s the upbeat tropicalia of tracks like “Maná”, and group efforts like “Tardei”, which also happens to feature Devendra Banhart and Kristen Wiig.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCavalo \u003c/em\u003eis an album that invites you to listen to it many more times, and with the weather getting wonderfully (and dangerously) hot over here, it’s very appropriate in its mix of joy and creeping panic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRecommended Tracks:\u003c/strong\u003e Nada Em Vao, Hourglass, Tardei, Irene\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGRADE: \u003c/strong\u003e8/10\u003c/p\u003e",

Quever illustrates his apparent disconnection with society at large, if not depression, with an ensemble of melody-driven, bright yet somber baroque pop songs. The melodies are undoubtedly good, propelled by solid piano and acoustic guitar arrangements and laced with elegant strings, drums, and bass. Quever’s lyrics center around an unsettling alienation felt among the “savages” of modern life, proud of technological advancement yet steeped in superficial worldviews and emotional deprivation. Indeed, many song titles directly reference a sense of isolation or shallowness: the compelling “Still Knocking at the Door,” flighty “Staring at the Bright Lights,” and forlorn “Tourist” to name a few.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe music is certainly consistent, though this may come off as complacency at certain points of the album depending on the listener’s mood and interpretation. While nothing of creative achievement, the songs nonetheless convey Quever’s weariness directly and with rather pleasant production to boot. This is truly music to be lost to. The introspective, sensitive vocals accompanied by fluid melodies are ideal for quiet contemplation or melancholic musings of all sorts. Chill without being mundane, somber but never desolate, Quever hits a balance on multiple songs that makes this album of interest for pensive fans of woodsy, contemporary indie-pop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecommended tracks: Still Knocking at the Door, Staring at the Bright Lights, Easter Morning\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGRADE: \u003c/strong\u003e7.5/10\u003c/p\u003e",

Prime Air is a service that makes 30-minute deliveries by the use of drones. This raises many issues as delivery drones on US soil have not been licensed yet. But can they be considered the same as remote controlled airplanes? Probably not as they are autonomous drones. However, unarmed, they do pose a variety of potential threats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePersonally, I wonder how Amazon.com will implement the delivery system. Who is to say they will not be shot down mid-air? Who is to say the drones are not going to fail due to technical complications and drop on someone\u0026rsquo;s head in the middle of the street?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese are all possibilities, but let us be grounded in the realm of all that is indubitable (let\u0026rsquo;s be real.) 30-minute deliveries are probably going to be expensive, but that is still besides the point. Who needs the 30-minute deliveries? I know. It\u0026rsquo;s lazy college kids like me who sit on the can to lose a pound of fecal matter, only realizing after the deed\u0026rsquo;s been done that the toilet paper is on temporary hiatus (read: I forgot to buy more toilet paper.) For such situations, Prime Air is the only solution available to mankind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks to the mind and heart of Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u0026rsquo;s founder and CEO, such miracles will now be possible where one will have to wait no more than 30 minutes on the loo to receive a gift from the sky that will allow them to proceed with routine life. However, Jeff Bezos has to have a greater motive than start a whole service for the sole purpose of delivering toilet paper to lazy college kids. Why? Because he is bald, and bald CEOs are evil and not to be trusted.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor your viewing pleasure: \u003ca href=\"http://youtu.be/98BIu9dpwHU\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmazon Prime Air in action!\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

This soundtrack was specifically made for \u003cem\u003ePalo Alto\u003c/em\u003e, a film directed and written by Gia Coppola. The story is based off of famous actor James Franco’s short stories and he asked Ms. Coppola to make a film adaptation of his work. Dev Hynes and Robert Schwartzman, former lead singer of alternative indie rock band Rooney, contributed to dream-like songs for the new film coming out May 9th. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"Apple-tab-span\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003eOther artists featured in this compilation/scored soundtrack are Nat \u0026amp; Alex Wolff, formers members of youth rock band The Naked Brothers Band, Mac Demarco, Jack Kilmer, Francesco Pennino and Coconut Records. “Rock Star” by Nat and Alex Wolff is witty and humorous with just a small hint of sadness. Their execution of the song is mesmerizing and will bring a smile to your face with natural occurrences during the song like Nat’s gurgling to produce an effect to the song. Nat Wolff is also featured in the film as the bad influencing friend. Another cast member featured in the soundtrack is Jack Kilmer, also the son of Val Kilmer (former Batman for \u003cem\u003eBatman Forever\u003c/em\u003e), and his song “T.M.” sounds like a garage grunge rock band. This perfectly fits the concepts revolving around the film which are sex, violence, drugs and problems. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"Apple-tab-span\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003eIn contrast to the crazy side of the plot, Francesco Pennino’s song “Senza Mamma” takes a ride with the classical waltz-like part of the film. Although it is waltz-like, it does give the audience a peek of Gia Coppola’s style. This piece balances the rest of the soundtrack with its traditional strings, brass and percussion.

With every beat, they change colors. Falling from them is a rain of melodies. As every rain drop hits me or the ground near me, a different fraction of the melody emerges from inside the drops. I strangely, do not seem to get wet, yet I enjoy the sensation of the drops falling on me.  \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThere is a warm, wind blowing on my face as we head towards the horizon. Carried on the wind is the lyric and vocal melodies of the record. This too, feels good. It is soft, and has the gentle touch of a love long forgotten. \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eAs the fourth track, \u0026ldquo;Aprils Song\u0026rdquo;(an instrumental piece - no vocals) begins, the jeep begins to gently take off of the ground and point gently towards to the sky, and I begin sailing above the landscape. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eWe keep ascending through the 6th track, \u0026ldquo;Crime,\u0026rdquo; higher and higher into the cosmos from whence we came. We are flying amongst the stars, and the planets, gazing into the heart and soul of the galaxies and universe. As the song peaks into its guitar solos at the end, my vehicle takes a nose dive, moving perpendicularly through time and space into a nebula, a swirling mass of a star being born. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eWe witness the grandest and most majestic of all beginnings. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eNow, we have come to the final two tracks. We pull up, sharply. We are flying vertically, higher and higher as \u0026ldquo;Horizon\u0026quot; plays. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eJust as the last song, \u0026quot;Navigator\u0026quot; comes to a close, we hit one point at the end of the universe. Everything slows down as we push through the edge like a finger through saran wrap, and I am back in my room.

I spoke with musician Kira Alexandra Clark about Muscle and Marrow, her influences, and how she makes music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUCLA Radio: How did Muscle and Marrow form? Where did you get the name?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKira\u003c/strong\u003e: Muscle and Marrow went through two formations before this one. I knew that I desperately wanted to play my music, and I also knew I needed other people to do that, as the songs certainly call for additional instrumentation.  I had a couple of bad experiences with the wrong people and finally talked Keith, who is my partner, into playing drums on some recordings. He was playing piano in another band at the time and considered himself a retired drummer, but ultimately I’m pretty persuasive and a year later, here we are. I can’t imagine doing this with anyone else. It’s the most intimate, tedious, and frightening thing I’ve shared with anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe name is a line from a poem I wrote. It references both fragility and strength which I have a lot of, and so does the music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are your main musical influences? What kind of genre would you consider yourself a part of, if you consider yourself a part of a genre at all?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSwans, Chelsea Wolfe, The Body, PJ Harvey, Shannon Wright, Fiona Apple. I am drawn to anything completely insane and dark and guttural and to anyone, especially if they’re female, who comes completely unhinged when they perform as though it cannot be avoided. I’ve always felt an otherness and to see anyone, especially a woman, who is utterly mad and commanding and undone is very moving for me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have no idea what genre we are in. We know that we like to play with dark bands. We also like to play with heavy bands. Sometimes we refer to our sound as atmospheric doom. Sometimes people refer to it as gothic. We don’t know what anything means.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre you excited about Portland’s music scene? Or any other cities’? What bands are you really into supporting?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are just starting to become excited about Portland’s scene. When we first started, we couldn’t find our people. The bands in the Portland scene who get a lot of attention are incredibly talented, but we really had to dig around here to feel any sort of personal community. We think we’re starting to find our people however. It turns out there’s a huge heavy music scene here. You just have to do more than read The Portland Mercury.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur top two bands right now are Haunted Horses from Seattle and A Volcano from Portland. A Volcano is truly weird and their live show is something close to terrifying and spiritual. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are other influences, not musical ones? What inspires you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePoetry. Artists in general. Women writers. Feminist artists. Experimental performance art. Experimental film. People who devote themselves to art and are not scared of that. My friend Lindsay inspires me. Emily Dickinson inspires me. That sheer desire to create, to make things. I am influenced by any sort of art that unsettles me. Going on walks alone at night inspires me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat were your favorite albums when you were a teenager? Any “guilty pleasures?”\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlanis Morissette’s Jagged Little Pill, though I think I was a bit younger than a teenager. Nirvana. Neutral Milk Hotel. Bright Eyes. Cursive. Currently I’ve been listening to a lot of Tupac which I also enjoyed as a teenager, though the listening experience this time around has been a much more serious and political one. As far as guilty pleasures go I love, love top 40 rap.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"667\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6f09c50ba2b0910afd7ba86becbd5179/tumblr_inline_n74podzkbF1qhakxc.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c9d6f9ed8f11dbca0bd46f9936966430/tumblr_inline_pk28wwWhvY1qitm77_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"667\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6f09c50ba2b0910afd7ba86becbd5179/tumblr_inline_n74podzkbF1qhakxc.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll of your merch and photos have a really great style! Where does it all come from?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you! It became clear that we had to start thinking about “branding.” We had and still have some conflicting emotions about it because it doesn’t seem very pure or organic, but honestly, I am not above vanity and it’s beneficial for us and the music to present ourselves in a certain way. I’m vaguely comfortable with exploring the idea of fashion as an art form or at least a creative expression. The branding is the visual aspect of the music that has to somehow communicate something about the music, so I guess we look at it as fun and necessary, but we’re also unsure ultimately how we feel about ego and image. Anyhow we definitely knew the photos had to be ethereal in nature, feminine but also gritty, like the music. We collaborate with who we’re working with in that regard, but so much of this is DIY at this point, that we’ve definitely had to develop a strong sense of vision for ourselves, and then find the right people to help implement that vision. Maybe one day I will be someone’s artistic prop and they will take my body and do wonderful things with it, and I’ll get to stop worrying about branding. Anyhow we’ve been lucky to have really talented photographers, artists and graphic designers working with us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is your songwriting and recording process like?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI write totally alone in my room on a guitar. I write simple, repetitive, droning songs that I wail over. When I’m ready I show little pieces to Keith who then usually starts singing it with me as I play it. Then we take it to the practice space and work on it again and again. Things about the song change in that process. We work on tone, tempo, structure etc. Then he will take the song and create samples to fill it in. That’s when the world is really completed. Once Keith gets a hold of the song it grows flesh over its skeleton.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur recording process was done entirely analogue. We fought a little bit and I cried a little bit, but mostly it was okay. I’ve learned a lot and I already have ideas concerning the next album. I want to be more meticulous, subtler, patient.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill you be performing in California any time soon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes!

    "content": "\u003cp\u003eBy Sheehan Parker\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan class=\"Apple-tab-span\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003eNo, Bilderberg is not a friend of yours that you need to rush onto facebook and congratulate after realising it’s their birthday.  Rather, Bilderberg is a top secret conference, held every year in Europe, and attended by the most powerful Western players in the fields of finance, industry, and, of course, politics.  The meeting, which convened a week ago in Copenhagen and finished on Sunday, is celebrating its sixtieth anniversary.  The corpus of attendees is comprised of influential and powerful westerners, with a total of 21 western nations being represented.  According to the BBC, roughly two thirds of the 140 or so attendees hail from European powers, the other third from the North American power(s).  What’s more, roughly a third of the attendees are from policy and political fields, while the rest represent their positions in finance and industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe topics up for discussion this year, as released by the Bilderberg group, include questions naturally of the upmost importance to the wealthy western industrialists: issues regarding the Ukraine, big shifts in technologies and jobs, and “Is the economic recovery sustainable?”.  It also includes loftier questions, questions ostensibly being determined by the very attendees themselves: “The future of democracy,” “Does privacy really exist?” and “How special is the relationship in intelligence sharing?”.  Perhaps most telling, is the topics of discussion which are geographically removed from the western conference.  Though there are no representatives at the conference from middle eastern nations, and China is the only represented western nation, and only marginally represented at that, the topics include “The new architecture of the Middle East,” and “China’s political and economic outlook.”  Who are the people in these discussions? And do they have the power to change the world based on the revelations the could be made at this secretive conference?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, they do have the power.  The chairman of the conference, French industrialist Henri de la Croix de Castries, is himself the CEO of the largest insurance company in France.  Perhaps more telling is the presence of former director of the NSA Alexander Keith, Swedish and Spanish ministers of foreign affairs, and of course the Supreme Commander of Allied Troops in Europe Phillip Breedlove; all of whom are nestled cozily amongst representatives such as Benoit Coeure, a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, and George Zanias, chairman of the National Bank of Greece, among others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI realise all this name dropping can be dizzying, and I wish I could get on to what was actually said at the conference- unfortunately, that is all secret.  The conference is closed to the press, and while members are free to discuss what was said, they are not to disclose the names or affiliations of the speakers.  When Al Jeezera asked a spokesman for the conference if it would have any tangible effects on current events, he responded that while the conference has no desired outcome, “we cannot comment on this issue.”  Well, when a room of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the world discuss current events, I don’t see how it could not have an impact on the world.  Ultimately, the Bilderberg Conference is a tangible example of the intersection between money and power which the people of the world feel every day; and it is exclusively the advice and considerations of western financiers and industrialists that the leaders of Europe and North America listened to for the past week.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Album Review: Curtis Harding - Soul Power",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Soul Power\" src=\"http://cps-static.rovicorp.com/3/JPG_400/MI0003/701/MI0003701308.jpg?partner=allrovi.com\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy: Jake Hook\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would punks like soul music? Curtis Harding, strangely enough, did not release \u003cem\u003eSoul Power\u003c/em\u003e through any conventional means, as far as soul music is concerned. Instead, he released it on cassette via the increasingly eclectic, ostensibly garage rock label Burger Records. Which, given that it sounds more like Curtis Mayfield than it does Frank Ocean, isn’t such a strange decision on his part. Stranger and riskier it is for Burger, whose biggest acts are, among other, street punks like FIDLAR and twee slackers like Cherry Glazerr. But his triumphal success seems to suggest that the risk paid off, not only paving the way for bigger and more interesting things for Burger, but huge opportunities for Harding, and the possibility that burnout teenagers all along the west coast might diversify their tape collection with something other than disgruntled white kids. And Harding certainly has a niche made out for him in the scene. Burger has already been known to associate with hip hop artists like Kool Keith and The Pharcyde, who at least dabble in soul and R\u0026amp;B, and if the music video for \u003cem\u003eSoul Power\u003c/em\u003e’s lead single “Keep On Shining” is any indicator, Harding is able and willing to appeal to the alternative crowd, and being from the same town as Burger alumni Black Lips certainly doesn’t hurt his credibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut the music speaks for itself really. “Surf” sounds like it could have been on the Lips’ last record if not for Harding’s unique and charismatic vocal presence, even including a totally shredding guitar solo played by Lips frontman Cole Alexander, no less. In fact, rock instrumentation seems to dominate this album, even when their arrangement is more suggestive of classic soul. Even on the more straightforward R\u0026amp;B tracks like “Keep On Shining” and “The Drive,” the horns are quite subdued and play more of a supporting role than they already do in the genre as a whole. That is, perhaps, what makes this album so much more than simply an experiment in retro style. It may not be Cee Lo Green (with whom he worked as a supporting vocalist), but it’s certainly not the sound of someone who buries their head in the sand when it comes to music newer than 1979.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe album contains its fair share of experimentation. “The Drive,” in addition to an irresistible backbeat and the aforementioned horn section, has ethereal synths that recall space rock and perhaps as a contemporary touchstone in the work of labelmate Gap Dream. “Heaven’s On The Other Side” dabbles in disco, and “I Need A Friend” features an infectious falsetto that reveals Harding’s vocal talents to be impossible to deny.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis record is by all measures, adventurous, and a worthy victory out of left field for soul music and the underground in general. Splitting the difference between classic R\u0026amp;B and modern alternative, things seem more promising than ever for alternative music, injecting a much needed variety. \u003cem\u003eSoul Power \u003c/em\u003eis as much punk rock as anything that King Tuff or Pangea might be doing, rejecting everything traditional about the territory that it treads and succeeding in spite of itself. Music media tends to paint Burger’s target demographic as slumming hipsters, but if my observations about the crowd at Burgerama (including the kids grooving to Harding’s set) say anything, it’s more accurate to say that a huge proportion of the fanbase here consists of teenagers who have yet to discover “Irony” in its most pernicious form. And, if Calvin Johnson’s observation that rock music is a “teenage sport,” then this bodes extremely well for the future of Curtis Harding’s career and the scene that gave it life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRecommended Tracks:\u003c/strong\u003e Next Time, Keep On Shining, Surf, The Drive\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGRADE:\u003c/strong\u003e 8/10\u003c/p\u003e",

One hundred percent of the proceeds from the show went to Mr. Holland\u0026rsquo;s Opus Foundation, a charity that gives instruments to local schools to benefit music education programs for children. If this great cause weren’t enough of a reason to buy tickets, Lykke’s incredible performance should convince you not to miss out on the next one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLykke started her set with the title track of the new album, an acoustic guitar-heavy song with dream-like vocals. The dark lighting and smoky stage combined with Lykke’s black attire produced a supernatural atmosphere, furthered by her haunting vocals. She is a remarkably expressive performer both in her songwriting and her style of movement when she performs, gliding from one side of the stage to the next while singing emotional lyrical content about heartbreak. Like many artists do at concerts today, she kindly asked the audience to put their phones away for a song, and encouraged everyone to have a moment with her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"334\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bc9148dbff0ed4caa7fd3364208a8fd3/tumblr_inline_n5w43v1utG1qhakxc.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b5aa1d76ccd330eb885208dbc4250dba/tumblr_inline_pk69giG5td1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"334\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bc9148dbff0ed4caa7fd3364208a8fd3/tumblr_inline_n5w43v1utG1qhakxc.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen she began singing “Little Bit” from her breakout album \u003cem\u003eYouth Novels\u003c/em\u003e, the audience sang along with every word. Her new album is of a slower pace, and the track “Love Me Like I’m Not Made of Stone” captivated listeners with her driving vocal melody. The higher pitches of her vocal range evoke so much emotion, as if she’s about to break into tears; and then she brings it back down to reclaim control. The trajectory of the concert as a whole was a slow build that erupted into a celebration of dance as soon as the band began playing “I Follow Rivers” from Lykke’s second album, \u003cem\u003eWounded Rhymes\u003c/em\u003e. The energy did not die down from there, as the pulsing bass and flashing red lights during “Rich Kid Blues” plus a brief “Drunk In Love” Beyonce interlude excited the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe distinctive drumbeat and quick tempo of the keyboard chords in “Youth Knows No Pain” kept up the momentum, pleading with everyone to “Come laugh away who you are and get down”. The outro to the song was a thumping electro-bass chant-a-long of the song title, a memorable moment in the show. Lykke’s popular hit “Get Some” carried this upbeat series of favorite tracks, and completed the set before the encore. Lykke decided to play a cover of “Silver Springs” by Fleetwood Mac, which she said always reminded her of California, where she wrote the majority of her most recent album. The set ended in “Sadness Is A Blessing”, and band walked off the stage to The Beatles’ track “Don’t Let Me Down”, although nobody was let down by Lykke Li’s incredible voice and talent. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0026ndash; photos courtesy of Getty Images for StubHub\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

However there are a select few that continue to shine bright. Clay Aiken is one of those stars, that now shine brighter than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClay Aiken, once golden boy of popular singing competition show, \u003cem\u003eAmerican Idol, \u003c/em\u003ehas won the Democratic primaries in North Carolina for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. He will now face GOP Representative Renee Elmers in the general election.  And hopefully for all those Claymates out there, the final results of this election will not end in another unexpected Ruben Studdard-esque situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAiken’s possible rise to political power is nothing new. Celebrities have been known to involve themselves in politics in the past, from the classic example of Schwarzenegger to the lesser-known involvements of Chuck Norris with the Republican Party. So why is this important?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen people in the media switch roles from singer of some kind of music (I don’t actually know a single Clay Aiken song) to an elected official, its only natural for us news consumers to take notice. So, am I ashamed that this is the only current event that currently comes to mind? Yeah, a bit.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn relation to other news, the future career of season 2 American Idol runner-up is probably not all that important. But hey, it’s entertaining.

Tickets are $10-\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI saw Trigger Warning this last week on Monday at Second City in Hollywood. It is a sketch comedy show, so I came in expecting funny. And it was. Funny, that is. As the title expresses, it touched topics that could offend, but I am a big believer in the power of comedy. It is not meant to offend, I believe, but meant to expose the extreme behaviors in society and satirize what is going on with racial prejudice, gender roles/sexism, and the uncomfortable parts of the world we all experience. One sketch directly addressed racial profiling, it was a sketch about, well… a sketch artist. Two caucasian cops were taking in information from an African-American woman about the robbery she was just a victim of. They seem to be on her side, and though slightly condescending they appear to be doing their job until the first reveal of the sketch, and it is an image of Martin Luther King Jr, and she very clearly was describing a Caucasian tall individual with slightly wavy hair, NOT King. It heightens, until finally she can’t take it, and she storms out. This is not only funny and uncomfortable because it’s clearly wrong, it makes us look at the current justice system and our police force with a new eye. That’s not all though, they satirize and bring to light issues of crazy celebrity treatment, domestic “violence” but in a clever way which relieves the tension at the end, modern day consumerism and our technology based culture. It’s a fun show and if you want to laugh and feel a little uncomfortable in your seat, I highly recommend it. But do be warned, they have a loaded gun, aimed at current social and political issues (some even taboo to talk about) and they “aim to offend”. Check out Trigger Warning (the warning’s in the title!!!).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSubmitted by Ken Rudnick; DJ Barbie; Host of \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/uclawwn\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.facebook.com/uclawwn\u003c/a\u003e UCLA Weakly World News!\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003eAvenging a six-point road loss from January 2nd, the UCLA Bruins Men’s Basketball Team defeated the University of Colorado Buffaloes by a score of 72-59 at Pauley Pavilion. Despite shooting only 25 percent from the three point line and receiving only eleven bench points, the Bruins were able to win their second conference game in a row behind Senior Norman Powell and Freshman sensation Kevon Looney. For the second game in a row, Powell scored over 20 points and paced the Bruins in scoring, contributing a full stat line of 22 points, five rebounds, five steals, and five assists while hitting 7 of 8 shots form the free-throw line. A likely lottery pick in this this years NBA Draft, Looney led the Bruins with ten rebounds, adding fourteen points for his eleventh double double of the season. Backcourt duo Bryce Alford and Isaac Hamilton each logged over 34 minutes, with Alford chipping in with eight points, five assists, and foul free defense, while Hamilton added twelve points of his own. The Bruins controlled the game from outset, turning a four-point lead at the half into a thirteen-point victory, while outrebounding, assisting, blocking, and stealing the Buffaloes, all while committing fewer fouls and turnovers. The biggest hurdle the Bruins were able to climb in this victory was the team’s continued improvement from the free throw line, following up a 75% performance against Utah by making 19 of 23 attempts on their way to an 82.6% mark. Defensively, this marked one of the Bruins stronger performances in quite some time, as they held Colorado to a 36.4% field goal percentage, while forcing 15 turnovers. Now up to sixth in the Pac-12 standings with a 5-4-conference record, the 13-9 Bruins will head to Northern California to take on conference foes Stanford and California Berkley, both of whom the Bruins defeated at home earlier in the season.\u003c/p\u003e",

Chris Paul added 17 points, 13 assists, and 0 turnovers for the Clippers who improved to 3-1 in 2015 with the victory as well 25-12 on the season as a whole.\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirk Nowitzki led the Mavericks with 25 points while Monta Ellis added 23 points, 4 rebounds, and 6 assists. However, Rajon Rondo was just 1 for 11 from the field for 2 points and the Mavericks floundered after head coach Rick Carlisle was ejected from the game after picking up his second technical foul just 6 minutes into the second half. Once again, the Clippers used a massive third quarter run to put the game away. They went into the locker room at halftime nursing 56-48 lead after a back-and-forth first half played at a blistering pace that had the Staples Center feeling like a playoff atmosphere. But LAC went on a 14-2 run to kick off the 3rd frame and never looked back from there, opening up a second half lead that peaked at 26. Coach Doc Rivers credited Blake Griffin’s strong play in his post-game interview saying of Griffin that “he’s such a weapon. He makes it very difficult to trap. He is so unselfish.” Rivers also praised Griffin’s decision-making when facing double-teams down low saying “Usually, that makes you go away from the post, but it actually made us go to the post more because we knew that would create a 2-on-1 and he kept making the right decisions.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"375\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bfb8a3ee4a2259d26cd8417fb986e577/tumblr_inline_ni8zbc7j2v1qhakxc.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a0055b241ffa181b1a9f366d4a747f36/tumblr_inline_pk5qhoLWyM1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"375\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bfb8a3ee4a2259d26cd8417fb986e577/tumblr_inline_ni8zbc7j2v1qhakxc.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003eRivers would go on to speak highly of the entire team’s mentality saying “I love the fact that, offensively, we never turned it off. I thought we played downhill the entire game and I thought that was important.” Chris Paul would echo his head coach’s sentiments in his own post-game interview, mentioning that “We want Blake to be aggressive, to shoot, attack, all that stuff,” also speaking highly of the job Griffin did defensively on Nowitzki. Paul also credited the victory today to “pushing the tempo,” “defending a bit better,” and “playing in transition a lot more.” He would go on to applaud Spencer Hawes’ efforts in stifling Rondo in the lane (Hawes recorded 3 blocks on the afternoon).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"501\" data-orig-width=\"376\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/42b76f95d1c773422b80895d12a134fd/tumblr_inline_ni8zcgeTHL1qhakxc.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/42b76f95d1c773422b80895d12a134fd/tumblr_inline_pk5qho4iDO1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"501\" data-orig-width=\"376\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/42b76f95d1c773422b80895d12a134fd/tumblr_inline_ni8zcgeTHL1qhakxc.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eGriffin, himself, gave kudos to the team’s offensive play: “Our offense was the biggest different today. Everyone that came on the floor played with pace. We all moved the ball and we all got easy shots. Things like that are the jolt that gets the team playing the right way.” The defensive-minded Matt Barnes chimed in saying “It starts from the defensive end. We’re a very talented team offensively. But when we have that defensive energy and get out in transition, we’re the best team in the world.” Barnes and J.J. Redick deserve a lot of recognition for the victory, combining to score 15 of the team’s first 17 points in the first quarter to really set the tone for the rest of the game. They finished with 18 and 16 points, respectively. DeAndre Jordan also posted 13 points and 15 rebounds. The Clippers shot 52% from the field today and hit 13 three-pointers. They also won the battle on the boards (47 compared to 40 for Dallas) as well as at the free throw line (21 attempts to 17 for the Mavericks).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"501\" data-orig-width=\"376\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1e0e4fec2d78a75462dd082e089ce974/tumblr_inline_ni8zc5IxeN1qhakxc.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1e0e4fec2d78a75462dd082e089ce974/tumblr_inline_pk5qhpKIoM1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"501\" data-orig-width=\"376\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1e0e4fec2d78a75462dd082e089ce974/tumblr_inline_ni8zc5IxeN1qhakxc.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eVeteran official Joey Crawford was forced to exit the game at the 7:42 mark of the second quarter after pulling up lame. He left the floor under his own power, not to return, and the game played out with 2 officials. Coach Rivers commented on Crawford’s injury saying “I was very concerned. But it looks like a meniscus from what I hear and you don’t want to lose Joey, I can tell you that.” On the possibility of coaching his son Austin, Rivers also said that he would be open to the idea. “I think a year ago, I probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t. But I think I would, for sure. I think this team could handle that. He\u0026rsquo;s a downhill guard, which is something we need.” Austin Rivers was traded to the Boston Celtics, the team that his father used to coach, on Saturday as a part of the Jeff Green-to-Memphis deal causing Doc to quip “I guess I shouldn’t have sold my condo.” But the Celtics seem poised to move him immediately and officials within Doc’s staff and the Clippers front office are reportedly pressuring him to deal for his son.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Clippers improve to 25-12 with the victory and will face off against the Miami Heat on Sunday afternoon in another Staples Center matinee game (3:30 PM EST/12:30 PM PST tip-off).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Mavericks meanwhile fall to 26-12 and will head to Sacramento for a Tuesday night matchup with the Kings (10 PM EST/7 PM PST tip-off).\u003c/p\u003e",

Scoring the first basket of the game, the Bruins led from start to finish, turning a 3-point, 33-30 lead at the half into a ten-point victory. Norman Powell led the team with 23 points, consistently having his way with the Utah defense in getting to the hoop, while reaching the free throw line six teams in the game. Bryce Alford contributed with 14 points and seven assists, playing tenacious defense while leading the Bruin defense in forcing 16 Utes turnovers. The crowd at Pauley Pavilion provided constant energy for the Bruins, with coach Steve Alford getting involved in the action with numerous fist pumps, hugs, and high fives directed at his team. The turning point in the game occurred in the first half, when freshman center Thomas Welsh laid down a thunderous one handed dunk en route to a seven-point performance, leading the UCLA bench. Overall, the Bruins shot 46.2% from the field, while converting on 18 of 24 free throw attempts for a 75% success rate. Across the board, the Bruins outplayed the highly ranked Utes, out-rebounding the visitors 29-27, while gaining three more assists (15-12), six more steals (8-2), and committing five fewer fouls (11-16) than their Pac-12 foe. With the victory, the Bruins break a two game losing steak and improve to 12-9 overall, while breaking the 500 mark in Pac-12 conference play with a 4-4 record. This Saturday, January 31, the Bruins will look to build on this upset when they take on the University Colorado Buffaloes at Pauley Pavilion, 7:30 pacific time tip.\u003c/p\u003e",

By the time Kindercore folded in 2004, Of Montreal had built an international name for itself, and their second release with Polyvinyl records, 2005’s the Sunlandic Twins, was a major critical success (and is printed on oddly charming red vinyl with haunting images etched on the B side.)  As the band developed with Polyvinyl, Kevin Barnes began to direct the musical development of the group’s releases more and more unilaterally; Kevin Barnes having written and recorded the entirety of Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer? (2007) himself, with help in particular instances from his family and friends in Elephant 6. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Nonetheless, a group is very much required for the band’s highly regarded concert performances.  The band will use the space that they’re in with ingenuity, such as the use of video projectors coordinating with on stage props in their last tour, which I was lucky enough to catch at L.A.’s Echoplex.  More often than not, their shows give the impression of being designed for the space, exemplified by actors’ use of the catwalk at the Hollywood Bowl.  On stage, the band is accompanied by actors working in choreography that expresses or accompanies the music; examples range from a bizarre butter-knife sword fight, or as support for Kevin Barnes as he enters atop their shoulders. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e No doubt, I’m equally excited for Of Montreal’s soon to be released album, Aureate Gloom, and their newest tour.  A track off of Aureat Gloom, “Bassem Sabry”, can be listened to now on SoundCloud; it underlines the tendency that Of Montreal has developed in recent albums towards a funky driving line.  At the same time, Barnes’ iconic vocals and a constant juxtaposition of the upbeat music with morose or troubling lyrics maintain the Of Montreal line which fans have come to identify with.  Soon to be entering their third decade of work, the band has released 13 accomplished albums including Aureate Gloom and shows no signs of abating.  Aureate Gloom will be available on Polyvinyl records March third, and Of Montreal will play two shows in Los Angeles on \u003cspan class=\"aBn\" data-term=\"goog_700909883\"\u003eMarch 22nd and 23rd\u003c/span\u003e, at the Regent and the Largo, respectively.\u003c/p\u003e",

Relatable and casual but still satirical, the recent episode “HI AMERICA” dares to discuss race with Tchaiko Omawale and friend Ibrahim, mainly on how difficult it is for white people to talk about Ferguson without sounding stupid. Ibrahim asks why white people are so angry about Ferguson, and argues that on matters of race, they should just listen, prompting Chelsea to bring up an important point that “listening” can translate to being just a passive uninterested white person. Later in the podcast, Chelsea talks to adoring callers, successfully pulling out a range of important topics from them, like when dogs should be put down or put on Prozac, and abruptly hangs up on them.

Coming off of a rather tight game with the University of San Diego, the team must establish a greater identity as before a tough home contest facing Gonzaga on Saturday and a road trip to go play Kentucky and Alabama before entering league play.\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis current group of Bruins is still growing together, but the players must learn to mesh a little better before the Pac-12 games start to roll around. The plethora of talented underclassmen is exciting, but team leaders must step up and take charge. Though Norman Powell appears to be offering the young group a veteran presence, Tony Parker has failed to take on a larger role both in the locker room and on the hardwood.\u003cbr data-reactid=\".89.$mid=11418244966917=2f69a3d42729e526426.2:0.0.0.0.0.0.$end:0:$1:0\"/\u003eWith that being said, perhaps the best aspect of the team this season has been the play of True Freshman Kevon Looney. The 6’, 9” forward out of Milwaukee, Wisconsin is a double-double machine and is already a projected to be a top-15 pick in the 2015 NBA draft. While he could probably do to improve his baseline jumper and add some muscle, Looney’s incredible length and athleticism certainly make him an attractive prospect to NBA teams. Not only Looney’s body type, but also his tenacity and aggression bring to mind comparisons to a young Kevin Garnett. Of course we will have to see how the rest of the season pans out, but if Looney continues to post a steady double-double, it will be difficult for the Bruins to retain the budding Freshman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eComing out and attacking during the second half of the last game against the Toreros, Looney finished with 18 points and 11 rebounds. His presence in the paint throughout the final period provided the Bruins an excellent change of pace to a game plan that included what had been mostly outside jump shots up to that point. Moving forward, Coach Alford should really reshape his offensive plan to include more passes to Looney on the drive or down low in the key. Looney’s 7’, 1” wingspan allows him the advantage of reaching over opponents for key offensive rebounds and put-backs. Additionally, the effort and energy Looney displays on a regular basis have already earned him more minutes, on average, than returning big man Parker. If this pattern continues, don’t be surprised to see Looney continue to be the Bruins’ first option in the frontcourt, and don’t say you weren’t warned if you see the Milwaukee product bolt to the next level after this season is over.\u003c/p\u003e",

Though the label started with many post-hardcore acts early on, their repertoire expanded as things progressed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuch to the founders’ surprise, what had started as a small effort to help support independent music grew into a label with several well known bands.

Another notable portion of their lineup was 90s emo, including such prominent bands as The Promise Ring, Texas is the Reason, and Jets to Brazil. Additionally, the label has a significant portion of Mike Kinsella’s (of American Football) project: Cap’n Jazz, Joan of Arc, and Owl. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can find out more about Jade Tree on their website, \u003ca href=\"http://www.jadetree.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.jadetree.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eby Jeremy, New Media Co-Manager \u003c/p\u003e",

In this episode, the chemistry is immediately obvious as Grace introduces Mamrie and offers her a Bloody Mary with unwashed celery. An hour of funny questions, quick quips, and hilarious anecdotes about gender-neutral dogs then ensues. One of many highlights: Mamrie tries to get Grace to name five \u003cem\u003eBeatles\u003c/em\u003e songs, and in response to Mamrie’s hint, “You need this right now” (suggesting The Beatles’ “Help”), Grace responds, “Do they have a song called ‘Deodorant’?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCheck out \u003cem\u003eNot Too Deep \u003c/em\u003eor any of Grace’s hundreds of videos on her YouTube channel, \u003cem\u003eitsGrace\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e",

Giannoscoli\u0026rsquo;s (Alex\u0026rsquo;s full last name) work on DSU definitely put me in a different atmosphere from first listen onward: at home in a suburban neighborhood on the midwest enjoying some time alone or at a backyard house show with best friends on break from school. Though I can never make out what Alex wants to thematically project in his songs (in my defense, Alex himself has stated in past interviews that he doesn\u0026rsquo;t see why people would try to make a concept or theme out of his own music as his writing is almost completely ambiguous and vague enough that it\u0026rsquo;s pointless to come up with a specific \u0026quot;meaning\u0026rdquo; of an Alex G song), I cannot give less of a shit.

The pacey Californian, somewhat affectionally referred to as “Landycakes,” once grabbed 20 goals in 25 games in a season, a season that inspired then-Bayern coach Jürgen Klinsmann to bring Donovan in on loan.

But there’s an argument to be made for Claudio Reyna, Clint Dempsey, Tim Howard, and several others when it comes to best. There is no argument for most important. Landon transformed the sport in this country. He is a huge reason why millions of Americans tuned in to the World Cup this summer, even if he was not in Brazil with the team.

    "title": "SHOW REVIEW: Future Islands @ the Wiltern (11/20/14)",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003eUp-and-coming synth-rockers Future Islands warmed up their audience with a massive dance party at The Wiltern on a chilly Thursday night. This marked the 20th night of the month-long event hosted by Red Bull’s #30 Days in LA with its mission to showcase new musical acts throughout venues around LA. Fans were greeted with a lively ambience with numerous minibars surrounding the lobby of a majestic theatre, while the actual venue was minimally populated with somewhat dull opening bands. As soon as the two opening bands finished, fans cut their chitchatting and rushed towards the stage. One man was clearly prepared for the party as he came dressed up as “Tin Man” from Wizard of Oz – also a song by Future Islands featured in their early albums. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"496\" data-orig-width=\"496\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a453449bbeded5b71a4f3393a887eec8/tumblr_inline_nfxzk2DbAb1qhakxc.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a453449bbeded5b71a4f3393a887eec8/tumblr_inline_pk1wxx2JDP1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"496\" data-orig-width=\"496\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a453449bbeded5b71a4f3393a887eec8/tumblr_inline_nfxzk2DbAb1qhakxc.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs roadies began to set up for the main act, hardcore fans immediately noticed that these men were the actual band members minus singer Sam Herring who was most likely behind curtains practicing his notable dance moves. All four members finally conjoined and began their upbeat set with “Back in the Tall Grass” off from their most recent album \u003cem\u003eSingles\u003c/em\u003e. Sam ordered everyone to stop playing towards the beginning of the song, as he was definitely not enjoying the build-up. Everyone applauded and cheered as they decided to restart their opening song with a more intensifying force. Sam finally juxtaposed his dancing along to the music as he swayed his hips and arms in a very seductive manner that drove the audience significantly wild. His dynamic style of dancing made his shirt tear apart which he did not notice after two songs. Meanwhile, Tin Man was unfortunately trapped behind the second section of the general admission area in which he later attempted to get closer, but was unluckily stopped by security.\u003cbr/\u003e \u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"370\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/173474d6ac0bcd59691eef3709f5a43b/tumblr_inline_nfxzi6vXlT1qhakxc.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d86107c9a0a695cd7e5c35162c02d40/tumblr_inline_pk1wxx5HC21qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"370\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/173474d6ac0bcd59691eef3709f5a43b/tumblr_inline_nfxzi6vXlT1qhakxc.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe dance party continued with full force as the band played every song from their recent album. Songs such as “Doves” and “A Dream of You and Me” made the audience jump repeatedly until their utmost energy was then transformed into a surreal mosh-pit with their hit-song “Seasons (Waiting On You)”. During this song, Herring roared as if he was trapped in a sea of despair portrayed by the melancholic lyrics. Similarly, in the song “A Song For Our Grandfathers”, Herring gazes at the ceiling with an extended arm as he reminisces about his own grandfather. The audience is able to detect his sorrow and stand paralyzed until the very end music note of that song. The celebration is however brought back to life by their continued set infused with an array of synth beats and groovy bass lines - a staple of Future Islands’ music.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"369\" data-orig-width=\"490\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8154e376d7eee45afb93aff1aba603d3/tumblr_inline_nfxzmdlJiq1qhakxc.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8154e376d7eee45afb93aff1aba603d3/tumblr_inline_pk1wxyrt501qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"369\" data-orig-width=\"490\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8154e376d7eee45afb93aff1aba603d3/tumblr_inline_nfxzmdlJiq1qhakxc.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA sense of climax and closure finally wrapped up the band’s live performance as balloons fell from the ceiling decor of The Wiltern. A total of 14 songs were played which made fans feel satisfied and head towards the exit. The band was however not ready to leave and came back up on stage with 3-song encore that kept the party going past midnight. Future Islands left the stage after almost a two-hour set filled with non-stop dancing triggered by the electrifying beats that have caused their success to keep growing due to their spirited musicianship.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003ePhotos \u0026amp; Words // Michelle Preciado\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

The messy haired musician strolled about on stage like a cowboy accompanied by fellow The Babies member, Justin Sullivan on drums. His curly locks thrashed about as he wailed on his guitar for songs such as “Harlem River.” The lyrics of his slower songs echoed some common/played out folk music stereotypes such as wandering, traveling, and homelessness, and it was glaringly obvious that Morby drew much inspiration vocally from Bob Dylan but that didn’t down play the skill Kevin Morby had as a folk artist. Though some of his set ventured into predictable grounds (I mean he had a harmonica neck holder at one point, seriously?) the saving grace of Morby’s performance were his jarring solos on every other song, and I found myself shamelessly banging my head whilst he shred his way into experimental folk rock territory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"375\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d176b7406293e66f6dd8939339f9285b/tumblr_inline_nggacwwqgP1qhakxc.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0babe07e5051d2672fad9ebd273d3cea/tumblr_inline_pk2sr4PR721qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"375\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d176b7406293e66f6dd8939339f9285b/tumblr_inline_nggacwwqgP1qhakxc.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eFollowing Kevin Morby’s onslaught on the folk genre and the El Rey audience alike, I waited anxiously for Angel Olsen to take the stage. I was curious to see how Olsen would follow such an upbeat performance, because everything I had heard from her was slowly paced and her music often approached very dark themes. To pass the time between sets I struck up a conversation with a rad dude from the crowd named Alex from Costa Mesa. In our conversation I mentioned that I typically enjoyed punk or any dance inducing music and that folk wasn’t my genre of choice. He told me he had seen Angel Olsen twice live, and he assured me that her performance would be special.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"667\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e96c3ecbfca86b269bb982ab5db6bae3/tumblr_inline_nggaewfgPZ1qhakxc.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/76dfeb5b95f9e9aa3ac687b536142937/tumblr_inline_pk2sr5SSnl1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"667\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e96c3ecbfca86b269bb982ab5db6bae3/tumblr_inline_nggaewfgPZ1qhakxc.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter much anticipation the red curtains of the El Rey slid open to reveal the headliner. I immediately felt like I was taken back to my high school’s prom night (or an even cooler prom honestly) as Angel Olsen appeared in a shiny black gown and began her set with “Free”. Drenched in colored flood lights and in the presence of her eclectic and talented band, Olsen continued delivering both old songs and her newer hits off of “Burn Your Fire for No Witness.” Everything Olsen sang she sang with a sly smile on her face, and every instance of silence between songs was down played by Olsen’s enchanting banter with the audience. She proved her almost humble and even shy demeanor when she giggled with us and told stories, before getting back to the confident self behind the vocals as she belted out the peaks of her songs and demonstrated her vocal range.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"375\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aaea72783082ad0155b983a1ef3f8717/tumblr_inline_nggaglz6Ac1qhakxc.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/60449e61d335a844a201b3a10aab213f/tumblr_inline_pk2sr5fM6s1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"375\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aaea72783082ad0155b983a1ef3f8717/tumblr_inline_nggaglz6Ac1qhakxc.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the song “Lights Out”, Alex leaned over to me and asked if I was enjoying the show. When I agreed that the set so far was bad ass he elaborated on his opinions on the genre. ”It’s like a romance movie versus an action movie,” He said, ”Punk shows are fun but this hits a different note.” I realized Alex was right as I found Olsen transcending her recordings and wooing me over to the folk rock scene. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"667\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/19992bc15fea3105be1db7cdc066e5da/tumblr_inline_nggahzWsx81qhakxc.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/90621a92cbf0de5fd4953c7f2f8979c4/tumblr_inline_pk2sr5vdzv1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"667\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/19992bc15fea3105be1db7cdc066e5da/tumblr_inline_nggahzWsx81qhakxc.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eTowards the end of her time with us, Olsen’s band left her on stage for a few solo songs. Olsen prefaced her mini solo set by telling the crowd how hard it was for her to play the next song when she was having such a good night. In turn she stuttered and laughed through the lines “Everything is tragic, it all just falls apart” but slowly and surely she rose to the dark tone of her song “White Fire” and the room was full of a brief sadness. Olsen and her band returned for and encore and concluded the early 80 minute performance with a hopeful rendition of “Windows,” the closer song of “Burn Your Fire for No Witness” though she remained physically static throughout most of the show her voice was able to permeate throughout the room for a unforgettable set. \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eI couldn’t believe it at first considering Kevin Morby’s stellar performance, but Angel Olsen exceeded every single one of my expectations, as she stole the show (and possibly my heart.) I would recommend anybody with even the most remote interest in American folk or either act to go check them out. Kevin Morby proved himself as a solo artist and Angel Olsen in particular was an immensely humble performer that deserves absolute respect. If I had to sum up Angel Olsen’s performance in one word I would find it difficult to use any other adjective than “charming.” \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eBy: Jeffrey Brownell (Beverly the Intern, on Coffee Talk, Sundays at \u003cspan class=\"aQJ\"\u003e6-8 PM\u003c/span\u003e)\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e",

Don’t let Joe Newman’s warbly, comical voice mislead you—this album is heartfelt and serious, at times even suspenseful and jolting. Sensitive, slow melodies are shaken up with gripping, nervous climaxes. The album takes you on a bittersweet, reflective journey up and down the winding, mysterious hills of a land they call Nara. It is an emotional journey— pasts are confronted, memories are reinterpreted, and sacrifices are made.\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe album intro alone is a musical journey. It begins with a whirling sound bath, pulsating with heterophonic, rhythmic, syllabic vocals reminiscent of Philip Glass’ “Music in Twelve Parts.” The vocal layers bleed and swirl until finally lo-fi lyrical vocals kick in, sounding like a long-lost cassette demo. The song conjures the feeling of a suspenseful, exotic circus. Layers of sound accumulate to thrilling heights. Would this song perfectly soundtrack a David Blaine escape trick? Yes. And that (probably) is a compliment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e“Arrival in Nara” is a tearjerker, a campfire nightcap, a goodbye prayer fit for a melancholy film scene where a wise and beloved elder quietly passes, or a widow mourns. It’s sung softly and sweetly— rawer than Alt-J’s more stylized musical concoctions. The follow-up track, “Nara,” is at once whimsical and eerie, playful and serious. Cirque du Soleil music composers, take note. At first Nara seems to be a magical, glittering realm, but beware of monsters lurking around the bend… we remain in Nara for ten more tracks. Or, arguably, nine: “Left-Hand Free” is the album’s black sheep (or Nara’s golden egg?), sandwiched smack in the middle of an otherwise cohesive narrative. This marks the first musical shift from ethereal, twinkly, free form soundscape to radio-polished, blues-rockin’ indie-soul. “Left-Hand Free” is a temporary free pass out of the Nara fantasyland, back to Planet Earth, where hits are manufactured. And on Planet Earth, the song happily fills the void left by The Black Keys’ latest departure from blues-rock into folky jingle-pop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eNow, back to the land of Nara. Snuggle up with alt-J’s soft side on the tracks “Pusher, “ “Garden of England,” “Choice Kingdom,” and “Warm Foothills.” If you like Antony and the Johnsons or Bon Iver, you will like “Pusher.” “Garden of England” is rose garden teatime music— a weaker strain than Mark Mothersbaugh is serving, though still pleasantly palatable. If you want to go on a coming-of-age, find-your-true-self-and-the-meaning-of-life pilgrimage, you will bring the song “Choice Kingdom” with you, if not in headphones then in spirit. “Warm Foothills” will make you want to fall in love, cozy up in a log cabin, and crunch around in piles of autumn leaves. Don’t feel bad if “Warm Foothills” is the amuse-bouche that leads to a nostalgic listen of your old Feist album.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eA few musically exploratory tracks are “The Gospel of John Hurt,” “Every Other Freckle,” and “Hunger of the Pine.” If you wish Yeasayer could soundtrack James Bond, give “The Gospel of John Hurt” a try. If not, go right to the standout track, “Every Other Freckle.” It sounds like Sufjan Stevens having a bad trip, which, as it turns out, is perfect. Speaking of psychedelics, put on the orgy scene from Zoolander, press mute, and play “Hunger of the Pine” (\u003ca href=\"http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Falturl.com%2Fiar9o\u0026amp;h=RAQGP4Ml5\u0026amp;enc=AZPONygTO1W3jXzk3afYAqKLzRwrWvSlKM414oe8xgqlkqE2n5Nxdyi120mRN6RBfaUP7kM00xk7M_NHJGb--09YML3jXVp-lbmogY67h4q2fGx9hcEvul9cSnfd9l3DTuZLpzKMhPeWLxfbcTTPi_CUnES0Gh3nQ9UlK0BeW_2ZWQ\u0026amp;s=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://alturl.com/iar9o\u003c/a\u003e). In this track, Nara becomes Wonderland, and you a walk a mile in Alice’s shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThere is a little something for everyone on this album. After a successful debut album, this second release from alt-J is just as confusing and pleasantly surprising as one would expect a second album from a new artist to be. With one hit already under their belt, they have loosened that belt a couple notches and taken full creative liberty. Besides “Left-Hand Free,” the only hits alt-J seems to care about are acid, not the Billboard charts. This is All Yours is an artistic, colorful flight of sound, with the inevitable compromise of Hit #2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e~Lauren Levy \u003c/p\u003e",

As three performers who have been honing their craft for almost 20 years, the show was a flawless (or at least just made funnier by any flaws) hour of comedians bouncing joke after joke on one another with a reparté that only comes with practice and the natural chemistry.  With the audience suggestion “unplugged”, Parham, St. Clair, and Mantzoukas launched into an hour-long scene that natural tangents aside, felt like a cohesive scene and a perfect example of long-form improv. The show then culminated in an audience Q\u0026amp;A, which led to the improvisers critiquing and joking about the show, something that is usually left unsaid. \u003cem\u003eMantzoukas And…\u003c/em\u003e is a monthly mainstay at UCB Franklin and a must-see for any improv fan.

The podcast also employs a cast of guests on each episode such as Amy Schumer, Chris Hardwick, Damon Lindelof, Adam Scott. \u003c!-- more --\u003eIn one episode the show even booked Vanilla Ice to explain just what was going on in his head when he filmed the critically panned “Cool as Ice.” The podcasts go about the task of deconstructing choice scenes and making sense of often nonsensical plot developments. On the latest full episode, Scheer and three guest star comedians, Rob Huebel, Chelsea Peretti and John Flynn debate the merits of “LOL,” a 2012 vehicle starring Miley Cyrus as a rebellious teen. The four tackle scenes in the film for almost an hour, commenting on the oddities not addressed throughout the plot. Their calling out of the strangeness of key scenes such as when Cyrus undresses and showers in the presence of her mom, played by Demi Moore, without explanation and another in which her friend fingers a raw chicken while on Chatroulette (“She is putting a camera into a raw chicken’s body cavity. That’s serial killer shit,” one comments) provide most of the fun in the podcast. Other segments include “second opinions,” in which Scheer reads out passionate five-star reviews of the films from Amazon.com users and show recommendations about whether or not to watch the movie under review. The films discussed on the “How Did This Get Made” may not be fun to watch, but the show certainly makes them fun to discuss.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By\u003c/i\u003e: Alexa Lee, UCLA Radio DJ (04/26/16)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDisclaimer: This is not an album review. Frankly, I find Lemonade’s visual and musical content so rife with emotional, historical and socio-political significance that trying to write a review that does justice to all the rich, nuanced points of the album without it being a thousand pages long or an incoherent mess of my emotions seems beyond by writing capability. This is an opinion article specifically addressing the way Beyoncé uses the intensely personal experience of infidelity in marriage as a vehicle to give voice to the black American woman, as well as other silenced, trapped communities.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn Saturday night, April 23, Beyoncé unleashed her visual album Lemonade to the world. This 57 minute, twelve track narrative chronicles the artist’s navigation through her strained bond with her husband, with the different stages of her journey often coinciding with the stages in the Kübler-Ross model of grief (denial, anger, etc.). However, interspersed amidst lyrics so intimate they can only be interpreted as directly written to Jay Z are broader but equally provoking messages acknowledging and challenging the history of oppressing the self.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe film includes excerpts from a 1962 Malcolm X speech on protecting black women, as well as footage of the mothers of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown. These portions of Lemonade, rather than contrasting Beyoncé’s emotional vulnerability, indicate that the struggle Beyoncé feels is analogous to the inherited, internalized struggle of black women everywhere. Beyoncé offers viewers a window into the hidden depths of her psyche. We are given privy to her search for resolution in the face of being cheated on. We are exposed to memories and emotions that, prior to this album release, only Beyoncé had felt and understood. But as the narrative expands to encompass the stories and images of other women, black families, southern American homes and communities—I could go on and on—it becomes clear that Beyoncé is doing more than just telling the story of her own marriage: she is telling a universally understood story of loss that reverberates across all human lives. She tells a story that is hauntingly intimate yet still evokes closeness and association in listeners. By oscillating back and forth between a private confession narrative and a narrative that represents the voices of all black women, Beyoncé reveals a unity between the two that transcends the individual. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLemonade draws upon parallels between relationship issues specific to Beyoncé and the universal feeling of visceral, disappointed pain, particularly amongst African American females. Ultimately, the effect of this comparison creates a harmonious dialogue between the experiences of the individual and the larger collective human experience. Beyoncé’s album demonstrates that the emotions that feel most personal and unique to us are what connect us to and resonate with the souls of all humans.\u003c/p\u003e",

Their ethos calls for an intimate venue – or at least one that is compact – where it seems incredibly possible that you might bump into them after the show. That is not to say the small venue went without grandeur. Decorated with hand-painted murals and marked with ‘safe-space’ notices, the intimately-bared personality of the Che Café lent weight to the emotive connection between the music and the venue.\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eEskimeaux played the entirety of their new EP, Year of the Rabbit, in which Gabrielle Smith displays her delicate craft in songwriting. The concert had an atmosphere of collaboration, Frankie Cosmos’ Greta Kline joined Eskimeaux on stage to assist with background vocals, as Gabrielle Smith would do for Kline later on with synth and vocals. After the crowd shouted requests for a favorite off of their 2015 album O.K., Smith obliged, ending their set with the song “Broken Necks.” The culmination of romping drums and wavering vocal lines filled the space where all the youthful confessionalism and nostalgia goes, akin to the last night out over summer. Purely sincere and sweet, the set ended with the social and spiritual proclamation that “nothing in this world is holier than friendship.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrankie Cosmos took the stage to play a set centered around her latest album release, Next Thing. Sporting a shirt which read “Small Size But Big Dreams,” which she said got from a rest stop, Greta Kline spoke with an endearing sense of humility and congeniality. She imparted a similar impression in her vocal delivery, though seemingly demure, there was a quality sense of self-assurance. With their songs existing as short-form bursts of energy with ever-fluctuating paces in tempo and rhythm, the audience had to get all of their dancing out in quick intervals. Airy synths worked to extend and draw out, while tight snare hits acted as punctuation. On songs “Tour Good” and “Outside with the Cuties,” Kline seemed to reflect on the experience of touring and songwriting with lines like, “I haven’t finished this song yet / will you help me fix it?” In those moments it was clear the concert experience was not just for the audience to soak in, but was also becoming an evolving part of Frankie Cosmos’ art. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the midst of all this, a promposal was made for two young audience members via Kline.

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By\u003c/i\u003e: James Wilson, UCLA Radio News DJ (04/25/16)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRace, and the politics and injustices that go with it, has forever been an issue in the American spectrum of politics. In recent months, the Black Lives Matter movement has sparked into popularity and notoriety across the nation. Through U.S. media, especially online social network sites, Black Lives Matters has brought heavy attention to the issues held between individuals of color and police forces across the nation. So what exactly is the Black Lives Matter (or BLM for short) organization? BLM was originally founded after George Zimmerman\u0026rsquo;s acquittal for the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old African American. Black Lives Matter became public through the use of the social media hashtag #BlackLivesMatter, and was co-founded by three black community organizers: Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi. Black Lives Matter has drawn inspiration for its organization from the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960’s, the Black Power movement, the 1980s Black feminist movement, Pan-Africanism, Anti-Apartheid Movement, Hip hop, LGBTQ social movements and the Occupy Wall Street movement of 2011.\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo what is Black Lives Matter standing up and protesting against? Black Lives Matters mainly organizes protests around the deaths of black people caused by law enforcement, as well as broad issues like racial profiling, police brutality, and general racial inequality in the United States criminal system. Some examples of BLM activism have been stopping Black Friday sales, shutting down train stations, and becoming a fixture on the presidential campaign trail by calling out political figures to take action. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e In terms of organization, BLM is not one single coordinated effort. Instead, it has a model similar to that of many organizations involved in the Arab Spring. BLM is a decentralized network without a formal hierarchy or structure, composed instead of smaller subgroups located throughout the country, connected to one another through communication over social media. This benefits the organization by giving each subgroup the ability to decide the issues it wants to tackle, especially issues more prevalent in their communities. These smaller groups are similar to UCLA’s Undercommons, where in the members have access to a country wide network, yet have the freedom to make their own unique impact on their community. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo how does music connect to the Black Lives Matter movement? The fact is that music is essential to the goals and ambitions of BLM. Protest songs have been used to rally support and energy since the Labor Union songs of the 1930’s. In today’s culture, protestors within the Black Lives Matter movement turn to several forms of protest music. They use both protest songs of the Civil Rights Movement and hip-hop and R\u0026amp;B that address more contemporary issues. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA perfect example of such a demonstration of music in protest occurred on July 28th, 2015, in Cleveland, Ohio, where a Black Lives Matter conference was being held at Cleveland State University. The events grew intense when police officers arrested 14 year-old Jonathan Walsh for allegedly being intoxicated on a bus and allegedly having an open container with alcohol. Walsh was taken into custody by police, much to the dismay of the activists nearby. Many of the BLM activists believed Walsh was being arrested unnecessarily. When they voiced their concerns, officers proceeded to pepper spray the crowd, causing more confusion and anger amongst those gathered. The growing crowd continued to peacefully exhort authorities to release the young man. Seemingly out of nowhere in the midst of all the intensity the crowd broke into a spontaneous rendition of Kendrick Lamar‘s “Alright” off of his album “To Pimp A Butterfly.” The crowd erupted into joyful dance and song, chanting “we gonna be alright” continuously despite confrontation by police. Not long after the incident began, Walsh was released to the custody of his mother, and the crowd dispersed, having accomplished its goal (James).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003en the example of this protest, Kendrick Lamar’s “Alright” serves as a tool to capture the crowds wound up energy and put it to use in a positive, peaceful manner. Despite a young man being arrested and members of the crowd being pepper sprayed by police, the crowd knows that they will be “alright” and that they will overcome. The protestors turn from being mad to being hopeful of change that they themselves may not yet be able to make. Protest music like Kendrick Lamar’s “Alright” sends a clear message of the desires of the group as a whole, and helps demonstrate a collective hope for change and improvement. Overall, the music helps gather protestors and prevent outliers from inciting violence or flaring tempers even more. Such a sense of unity and direction is essential when working with such a large group of motivated and charismatic individuals. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow has a single rapper been able to capture the hope and imagination of so may people? First, lets look into his history. Kendrick Lamar was born in Compton, California, on June 17, 1987. Lamar grew up around precarious street activity, which affected his family and friends. Yet Lamar was more influenced by street culture than harmed from it, as he continued to be a good student in school who loved art and music. Lamar began to write and perform rap lyrics at age 16, performing and writing more and more music until eventually meeting with   Dr. Dre in 2010 and jump starting his career into national fame. Kendrick’s humble roots from a low-income community and his authentic, down-to earth rap lyrics has led to his mass popularity in American culture that transcends race and gender.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have always been aware of Kendrick Lamar and the impact of his music, but never the core message of so many of his songs. Kendrick’s album “To Pimp a Butterfly”, especially the above mentioned single “Alright”, seeks to instill hope in spite of the troubling state of the relationship between America’s police forces and young black and brown men and women. As someone not of color, I have never sought such meaning from Kendrick’s work. But researching it now, I can’t help but admire the freshness it brings to the conversation of race in the U.S. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKendrick’s message is about finding the hope and positive influence for kids like Walsh, so that they don\u0026rsquo;t lose themselves to the streets and end up in situations like these where protests could develop and become violent. This protest was not violent, but I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that Kendrick would appreciate it if say, Walsh had been selling drugs and a protest for release via Kendrick’s message was used for \u0026ldquo;racial injustice\u0026rdquo;. The song is about hope. Hope for a future generation and nation. Not about being \u0026ldquo;alright\u0026rdquo; to do whatever they want and expect that playing the race card can solve the problem. Yet despite all this, Kendrick is courageous enough to start and continue the conversation about racism in America. As Tupac Shakur once asserted: “I\u0026rsquo;m not saying I\u0026rsquo;m gonna change the world, but I guarantee that I will spark the brain that will change the world.

EWBAITE represented the group’s well-thought out effort to connect back to their 90’s roots; the song “Back to the Shack” effectively acted as an apology for Weezer’s post-Pinkerton works, while “Eulogy for a Rock Band” addressed the theme of nostalgia, in which everyone knows that they their favorite rockstars were already are past their prime.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe White Album, however, turned this sentiment on its head.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhereas EWBAITE was somewhat shaky, with its fair mix of solid and not-so-solid tracks, The White Album or (Weezer) hits all of the right notes.  Its spirit and theme are explicit; the ocean sounds heard at the beginning of the opening song elicit feelings of summer and set the stage for the rest of the sunny album.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrimarily using SoCal beaches as their songs\u0026rsquo; settings, Weezer expertly navigates through the ups and downs of summer romances.  The first couple of tracks, namely “Wind in Our Sail” and “(Girl We Got A) Good Thing,” sweetly celebrate the “ups” of summer love, with Cuomo crooning about the prospect of having exciting adventures with his crush .  However, the album then devolves into the “downs” of summer love, with the edgier and darker “Summer Elaine and Drunk Dori,” “L.A. Girlz,” and “Jacked Up” recounting heartbreak. The final song, “Endless Bummer,” is a poignant album closer.  It reminds us the ephemerality of summer vacation, as well as our desire to go back to certainty and security after a few months of unrestrained freedom.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot only does The White Album act as a perfect metaphor of the evolution of the summer fling lyrically, but the music itself fits into the theme seamlessly as well.  Cuomo, Weezer’s primary songwriter, echoes shimmery 1960’s Californian sunshine pop in his composition of the record.  In a few interviews, in fact, he gives direct credit, citing influences as broad as \u003ca href=\"http://pitchfork.com/news/62916-weezer-announce-weezer-the-white-album-share-king-of-the-world-video/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Beach Boys\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/hrishihirway/song-exploder-weezer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eas specific\u003c/a\u003e as \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqAh1dQu_pg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea single track by The Left Banke\u003c/a\u003e.  Wherever he found his inspiration, it is clear that Cuomo \u003ca href=\"http://genius.com/Weezer-king-of-the-world-lyrics\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eput a lot of care \u003c/a\u003einto crafting The White Album, and it certainly shows; from beginning to end, the album is truly a pleasure to listen to.  Sonically and thematically, the tracks make sense as a coherent narrative, and with supremely catchy melodies and the dynamic guitar-work that call back to Weezer’s first two albums.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a Weezer fan who was too young to revel in the original The Blue Album and Pinkerton hype and instead grew up during the band’s “dark era,” I am absolutely ecstatic to report that The White Album is a fresh, 2016 spin on “old Weezer” that still manages to forge its own unique identity.  And with Rivers already alluding at an upcoming \u003ca href=\"http://pitchfork.com/news/63610-weezer-share-la-girlz-rivers-cuomo-says-hes-already-working-on-the-black-album/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e“Black Album,”\u003c/a\u003e it will be exciting to see where the group goes next.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDaaamn Weezer indeed.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By\u003c/i\u003e: Courtney Burness, UCLA Radio DJ (03/28/16)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe faces on NBC comedy are America Ferrera and Eva Longoria. Ferrera stars in \u003ci\u003eSuperstore, \u003c/i\u003ewhich follows the lives of retail workers in a giant megastore, while Longoria heads \u003ci\u003eTelenovela\u003c/i\u003e, starring as the star of a Latino soap opera star. It is incredibly rare even to have two women as the faces of comedy on a major network, and being two women of color is practically unheard of. The most important thing about these women being the faces of comedy is that their characters are well rounded, not stereotypes. Complex characters - people with flaws, who learn and grow and change -  are the key to really moving forward with representation on television and in other forms of media. Not just placing characters in roles as the \u0026ldquo;token,\u0026rdquo; but as a fully developed character. Having diversity on-air is important for the next generation. Kids need to be able to see their cultures and backgrounds represented in media in order to inspire them to \u003ci\u003ebe \u003c/i\u003ethe next America Ferrera. Another show that succeeds in doing diversity the \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; way in Brooklyn Nine-Nine, a FOX program. With multiple leads of color, they subvert stereotypes in race, gender, and sexuality, and the characters are still allowed to be funny. Racial and ethnic backgrounds are never used as punchlines; it deals with issues involving these topics through comedy but never makes jokes \u003ci\u003eabout \u003c/i\u003ethe issues. They\u0026rsquo;ve dealt with police brutality, sexual harassment, and homophobia and racism in the police force. This just goes to show that a show can have meaning, include a diverse cast, and still be funny. You \u003ci\u003ecan\u003c/i\u003e have it both ways. Obviously three is still a long way to go in terms of diversity and representation in comedy. However, it\u0026rsquo;s important to recognize when networks and show creators are making conscious efforts to include complex female characters, characters of color, and LGBT+ characters. Not just stereotypes. They are by no means perfect, but writers and creators can take a lesson from shows like \u003ci\u003eSuperstore \u003c/i\u003eand \u003ci\u003eBrooklyn Nine-Nine.\u003c/i\u003e Many people mistakenly believe the unfortunately common stereotype that \u0026ldquo;women aren\u0026rsquo;t funny.\u0026rdquo; The faces of NBC comedy and other leading ladies on different networks are here to prove them wrong.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Film Review // The Witch (2016) - Directed By Robert Eggers",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By\u003c/i\u003e: Anastasia Gershman, UCLA Radio Digital Press Member (03/09/16)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe Witch\u003c/i\u003e (2016 – dir. Robert Eggers) is a film that will find its way around and through any expectations that you have of it.  It may disturb you and ruffle your feathers.  It might tear away the veil of adulthood that normally keeps you from clapping your hands over your eyes and watching the scariest scenes through your fingers.  It won’t coddle you, coerce you or fool you into watching even when you feel uncomfortable.  If you want to leave the screening you won’t, because as much as the movie scares you – you won’t be able to leave until you know the truth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Christianity is not the hero of this movie, be forewarned.  \u003ci\u003eThe Witch \u003c/i\u003eis fiercely executed story about familial savagery and itchy paranoia. Set in 1630 Plymouth, it follows a Puritan family’s journey to a life at the edge of a looming wood where they are plagued by the machinations of the witch living in the forest.  But even that much is not certain.  The magic of the film is the building sense of psychological horror as family members question the nature of reality and find that their faith can’t give those answers.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore than anything else this is a movie about women and the relationships between them.  As eldest daughter Thomasin comes of age in this isolated backdrop, it appears that the entire family is cursed.  The corn is blighted; the goat’s milk turns to blood; the witch of the wood steals the baby of the family; and religious hysteria mires the family in the dark and dirty places that Christianity cannot reach. They beg God for his attention while they neglect each other.  A puritan family too extreme to share space with other puritans, their descent into madness is as sticky as it gets as they reveal themselves unable to handle challenges to their faith without drawing blood from one another.  Thomasin’s transition from girl to woman becomes the flame put to the powder keg of repressed sexuality and pent-up frustrations that are a necessary part of religious oppression.   Her family moves in tightening circles around her, unware that their plans to snuff her out might have the opposite effect of making her burn brighter and hotter.  There is a witch.  Make no bones about it and this is in no way a spoiler, there is a witch.  However, the work here might be to ascertain who the witch really is.  You have choices.  All of them are wrong and all of them are right.  That’s one of the things that make this movie so ferocious – you will get answers and still never be sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCast is outstanding with Anya Taylor-Joy becoming a star as she explodes into the role of Thomasin.  In a film populated entirely by standout performances, Harvey Scrimshaw as Thomasin’s younger brother Caleb \u003ci\u003eowns\u003c/i\u003e a role few would even attempt, with one scene in particular that will be seared into your memory forever.  The austere setting;  the building anxiety of religious paranoia;  the growing sense of sexual tension;  the antics of one big, black angry goat;  and the ongoing menace of the woman in the wood all come together in one terrifying package that will scare the daylights out of you if you are watching at all.  This is a fantastic example of empowered and powerful storytelling and the birth of a film horror classic.  Not for children, mandatory for adults.  Highly Recommended. \u003c/p\u003e",

Every month she hosts a charity show at \u003ci\u003eLargo, \u003c/i\u003ea historic venue in Los Angeles best known for its alternative comedy/music performances, live podcasts and improvised theater shows. Sarah’s comedy career has traversed an infinite plethora of genres and mediums; it should not be surprising that her guests (the “Friends”) range from various generations and styles of comedy. I have personally been to the monthly \u003ci\u003eSarah Silverman \u0026amp; Friends \u003c/i\u003eshow six times and here’s who I have been able to see over the course of these shows: Zach Galifianakis, Tom Papa, Doug Benson, Todd Glass, David Spade, Dana Carvey, Bo Burnham, Chelsea Peretti, Maria Bamford, Jerrod Carmichael, and Steve Agee. And the best part is, the line-up (besides Sarah of course) is not pre-announced, so you never know what you are going to get until you get to the show to see for yourself. Believe me, it is hard to be disappointed by these delightful surprises.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e            If you love comedy, music and charity, go to this show. If you want to experience an unforgettable night at one of the coolest and most intimate venues in the city, go to this show. I have brought friends, dates, younger cousins, and even my aunt; each time I shared the beautiful experience of synchronized laughter. Moral of the story: no matter who you go with and what your taste in comedy is, this show has something for you. Check it out, it is a blast.\u003c/p\u003e",

The band playing in front of it, however, could not be more different from its apathetic mascot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn February 9th, indie pop trio Jukebox the Ghost stopped by The Regent Theater on their U.S. tour. After launching into the timelessly punchy “Good Day” from their first album released nearly eight years ago, they continued their high-energy setlist with catchy, feel-good music.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eSimply put, the band is pure fun. Drummer Jesse Kristin would casually toss drumsticks in the air as he went to grab maracas instead; pianist and vocalist Ben Thornewill fully immersed himself into the ever-popular “Schizophrenia,” cocking his head towards the audience with eyes widened and eyebrows raised; guitar and vocalist Tommy Siegel cheerfully sang about an apocalyptic tidal wave engulfing everybody in “The Stars.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven if the song was about a break-up, as was the case for “Made for Ending” and “Sound of a Broken Heart,” Jukebox the Ghost remained upbeat in their performances, displaying an intriguing duality and contradiction between their wistful lyrics and bright sound.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eContinuing their trend of playfulness, in the middle of their set, the group brought out a “Wheel of Songs” to spin, featuring numbers that they don’t usually play on tour. For our show, the first spin landed on “Hold It In: Supreme,” in which the bandmembers switched instruments and then attempted to perform the entire song. The usual fan favorite “Hold It In” evolved into hilarious chaos, with Siegel looking particularly lost as he semi-randomly plunked at Thornewill’s keyboard. The second spin resulted in “Black Hole,” a lighthearted track that Jukebox the Ghost wrote for “The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show,” a children’s cartoon series.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe last highlight of the show was the band’s Queen covers. Giving us a taste of their HalloQueen show from last October, Thornewill and Siegel channeled their inner Mercury and Bowie in “Under Pressure,” doing a great job in paying homage to and emulating the vocals of their respective musicians. The group further showed off their theatrical ability, as they performed “Bicycle Race” as one of their encore songs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith more than ten years of recording and performing music under their belt, it is mystifying as to how the trio can keep up their energy as tour-centric band. However, from their silly Snapchat stories, to Siegel’s doodles posted on Twitter, to their playful live concerts, the band seems to find fun most everywhere in life — which I believe, is the true spirit of Jukebox the Ghost.  \u003c/p\u003e",

DJs feel the pressure to produce new tracks to remain relevant and in addition, the advent of social media requires that producers work at hyperspeed in order to feed the demands of attention-deficit listeners. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo what then is the problem with ghost producing anyway? This by no means a novel dilemma. Throughout history famous artists often take credit for another’s work. So long as these ghost-producers are getting compensated in some way, what’s the issue? Or should celebrity artists not be exempt from exoneration just because of their brand? What then constitutes a DJ’s authenticity if ghost-producing is considered acceptable? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn my opinion, people truly irked by the inauthenticity of ghostwriting/producing will find independent artists, while those unconcerned by this will blithely listen to their mainstream DJs, regardless if they have people working behind the scenes or not.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are then two stances one can take on this, as expressed by the following two insiders, both of whom have both worked anonymously for famous DJs. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I’m just a nerd standing up to the jock who stole all the nerd’s homework.”  -Mat Zo\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Nobody cares if it\u0026rsquo;s your track or other people\u0026rsquo;s track as long as the party is good.\u0026rdquo; -Tocadisco\u003c/p\u003e",

That (Ontario) is the province.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDo you still live there?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eI still live there, yes.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDid growing up there affect the way you make music now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eI don’t know if the city itself did. I think what maybe affected the way I make music for a little while was going to school for music, but the city itself, not so much.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDoes Hamilton have a developed music scene?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eYeah, they do, but it’s not like… It’s not like Los Angeles (laughs). I mean, it’s cool, though. There’s a lot of local artists and it’s cool because it’s a city where there’s a lot of… Kind of weird people doing weird art where the goal isn’t to make money or to be recognized. I think it’s more because people are compelled to. They play music just for the sake of being creative, so you get a lot of weird stuff. That’s what I like about the city, though, because there’s no other prerogatives in mind.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo you have a better idea of the type of people you’re interacting with?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eYeah, like you know their goal, and I guess it’s just to be creative.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo going back to your time at school, you have a background in jazz piano studies and spent some time in a Masters program for it. Does your background in jazz piano play a part in your current songwriting process?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eYeah, it does. In school, I learned what I feel like is one of the most valuable things, which is how to listen to music, lift the chords, and play them yourself. That’s how I started a lot of my own songs- it was by listening to other people and sort of learning the songs I really liked, and then it all kind of seeps in. Then I try those chords in a different way, or make it slower, or faster, so that plays a huge part in my creative process.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo it’s almost like remixing your faves?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eYeah! So it’s not recognizable that I’ve, like, totally ripped off somebody else’s song (laughs). But, you know, there’s so many other influences that come in. You can’t make it too close to the real thing.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrue, don’t want to get sued.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eOh my god, no.

What’s the creative process like when working with him?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003ci\u003eWorking with Jeremy is great. He’s really easygoing. There’s no ego when we’re in the studio and he’s willing to take risks. I think one of the most important things when working with somebody is that you’re both not worried too much about making something bad. I think in order to make something good, you have to be willing to kind of put yourself out there. You have to risk looking stupid or adding a stupid part, but you just can’t think of it that way. He’s really creative and willing to try different things to make a song work.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn that case, what’s the most “out there” thing that he, or you, have done when making a song?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn terms of “out there” stuff, I’m the more adventurous one when it comes to integrating samples and different, weird sounds. Jeremy is good at making something cohesive out of things that sound like a bunch of insanity, or things that are atonal. I’ll come back with a verse or a chorus that I’m really happy with, but I know it needs another part. Jeremy’s great at adding, like… a bridge. Or being like, “No, this should be the chorus.” He’s good at sequencing and coming up with different chord progressions. He’s a good finisher.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOh, so like a “closing paragraph” type of guy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003ci\u003eYeah, I’ll have a very strong idea. I’ll be like, “I’ve got a verse and a chorus,” but it’s only a minute and thirty seconds long. He’s really good at fleshing ideas out and making them actually finished songs, whereas I’ll have, like, ten ideas. And they’re… good, but just not done, you know?\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2296\" data-orig-height=\"1486\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/420ee9c6fd13de1c65bda372e28e2f77/tumblr_inline_o68av40w1U1qhakxc_540.png\" data-orig-width=\"2296\" data-orig-height=\"1486\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour music is very pop-oriented, but you also pull from more underground sources like footwork and the techno group Yellow Magic Orchestra. Do you have any aspirations for pop-stardom, or do you feel more at home slightly left of that field?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eI don’t know if people would, like, accept me as I was (laughs). I’m not glossy enough. I wouldn’t describe myself as being rough around the edges, but I think you have to have a certain degree of polish to be accepted by the masses. I don’t think that’s gonna happen for me, but you never know. I feel like unconventional pop stars were much more normal twenty years ago. People have gotten more conservative, you know? But, it’s hard to measure when you weren’t there living it. I guess you could look at the numbers; even the numbers for pop stars were different then than they are now. I always think about bands like The Art of Noise going number one on the pop charts. “Moments In Love” was a number one hit on the charts, which is crazy. I can’t think of that happening now. It just doesn’t seem like something that would happen in 2016.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour lead singles from \u003ci\u003eOh No \u003c/i\u003ehave a lot of aesthetic and compositional elements that are similar to freestyle music. That’s something I grew up listening to, and it’s a big thing in Southern California. You actually did a project with Morgan Geist’s The Galleria that was directly influenced by Freestyle, too, so would you say freestyle music is something that influences you in your own music?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eI really love where freestyle skirts the line with boogie. Like in Carmen’s “Time to Move” and “Throw Down,” you hear funk in freestyle. I love her, I think she’s one of my favorite voices. I’m not a freestyle expert by any stretch, but I do love those unconventional pop voices that are a bit rough around the edges. Madonna had that, too, when Jellybean Benitez was producing here early stuff like “Sidewalk Talk.” So I think I definitely am influenced by freestyle, and by boogie and funk and disco and all those genres that surround freestyle.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDo you have a favorite freestyle track?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eCarmen’s “Throw Down,” and I love Debbie Deb’s “Lookout Weekend.” So good. She’s got such a funny story. Morgan Geist actually schooled me on Debbie Deb. She was really self-conscious about getting her picture taken, so there’s not very many pictures of her at all. She was really young, so she couldn’t perform in the clubs that made the record a hit. Her record label treated her really weird; they had a stand-in Debbie Deb!\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"459\" data-orig-height=\"344\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKSC-8mxfXKI\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"405\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KSC-8mxfXKI?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou often talk about your wide range of influences when making your music, but do you have one particular record, album, or artist that you find yourself continually returning to for inspiration?

From that song, I got really into Kashif who produced “Love Come Down.” He has some really great tracks that sound kind of like “Love Come Down,” except it’s him singing. Same type of funky bass lines. And Prince, R.I.P. after the shitty news that came today. He’s a huge influence for me, as well. One of his first records especially, the self-titled record.

The NBA playoffs are upon us. Yes, our memories are still fresh from Kobe Bryant’s amazing 60 point swan song or the Golden State Warriors breaking the record for most wins in a season by reaching 73-9, beating out the 1995-1996 Chicago Bulls that went 72-10 while being led by Michael Jordan. However that was the regular season. Legacies are defined in the playoffs. Without further ado, here is our NBA Playoff Preview:\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEASTERN CONFERENCE\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1 Cleveland Cavaliers (57-25) vs. 8 Detroit Pistons (44-38)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePistons 3-1 In the Regular Season\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Detroit Pistons are a young team with a concrete identity lead by a brilliant head coach, however they lack the high end talent and experience to really make a deep playoff run. The Pistons are a team with an identity: the pick and roll between their point guard Reggie Jackson and their center Andre Drummond. This play has been near unstoppable during the regular season and they surround this play with 3 point shooters that gives them an extra option in case that play is shut down. Although, this is a 1-8 matchup, the Cavaliers could have some issue defending the Pistons due to not having the personnel to deal with Andre Drummond. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, Cleveland still has the more talented roster and arguably the best player in Lebron James who the Pistons cannot really deal with either. There are very few players that can make an impact on the game on offense and defense like a fully engaged Lebron James. Furthermore, Cleveland has a better defensive roster and they should be able to shut down the majority of what Detroit can throw at them. The Pistons have a huge coaching advantage in Stan van Gundy and I expect him to make some adjustments to make this series competitive but the talent disparity and Lebron James will be what ultimately helps Cleveland prevail. \u003cb\u003eCavaliers in 6.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e2 Toronto Raptors (56-26) vs. 7 Indiana Pacers (45-37)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToronto 3-1 in the Regular Season\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToronto has attained its largest win total in team history thanks to career years from the dynamic backcourt of Kyle Lowry and Demar Derozan furthermore their do it all defensive forward Demarre Carol is back from injury, and he should help shut down Indiana’s only really dynamic scoring threat in Paul George. The only issue with this team is the two early first round playoff exits that it has had the last two years and until they prove otherwise, questions regarding the team’s mentality will persist. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Pacers were lead dynamic wing Paul George, who was able to come back this season from a gruesome leg injury and cemented his status as a top 15 player in the NBA. However, the rest of the roster does not inspire confidence talent wise. Credit the coach Frank Vogel for creating a top 10 defense with the players he has, but the offense is near the bottom of the league with only really Paul George being able to create his own offense. The Raptors will be able to shut them down relatively easy and score by getting to the free throw line. However, because of the early playoff exits, the Raptors may drop a couple games due to lack of mental toughness to a team they should sweep with relative ease. \u003cb\u003eRaptors in 6.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3 Miami Heat (48-34) vs 6 Charlotte Hornets (48-34)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven Series 2-2 in the Regular Season\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn paper, this should be the closest series. The Miami Heat have come back from the dead with a revamped roster full of veterans and some surprising rookie contribution to become a dominant defensive team and a weird offensive team. They have Dwyane Wade still being star player he once, and dynamic center Hassan Whiteside tearing it up inside and blocking everything in sight during a career year. This team though, goes through scoring droughts that last not only minutes but can go on for whole quarters during which teams tend to catch up if Miami is ever ahead. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNo one had Charlotte pegged as a playoff team, but they have exceeded expectations with a roster full of awkward white guys and a fearless sharpshooting point guard in Kemba Walker.  Kemba Walker Has made improvements that has elevated him into the elite tier at his position. Nicholas Batum, their prized offseason acquire meant via trade, has returned to form as a shooter, passer and playmaker. They play conservative and disciplined defense along with a fun three happy offense that can win them games. However, the Hornets are inexperienced and many have never been to the playoffs. Overall the Heat core has made deep playoff runs before and young teams tend to suffer from stage fright. Those one to two games that Charlotte will need to acclimate themselves to a playoff environment is enough to of a disparity for the Heat what should be a tightly contested series.\u003cb\u003e Heat in 7. \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e4 Atlants Hawks (48-34) vs 5 Boston Celtics (48-34)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHawks 3-1 in the Regular Season\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis game is probably the most fun and interesting matchup of the first round in the east. Atlanta Hawks may have not been as good offensively this season as last, but they reinvented themselves having the second most stingiest defense behind the Spurs’ historical mark. They do not have a traditional rim protecting big, but Al Horford and Paul Millsap have been great doing that and guarding the stretch 5’s and 4’s that would give traditional big men trouble in today’s NBA. They have two amazing guards take turns being great, and they have a lot of depth in their defensive wings. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoston has been led by a genius coach in Brad Stevens and Isiah Thomas has had an all star season scoring the basketball. But outside of him no one is great at getting their own shots. Boston however has the best collection of tenacious perimeter defense and Jae Crowder has gotten healthy right as the playoffs have started to act as fulcrum defensively and offensively. The oddball collection of bigs that Boston however will not be able to stop Al Horford or Paul MIllsap which is why In the end, I think that Atlanta pulls it out. \u003cb\u003eHawks in 7.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWESTERN CONFERENCE\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1 Golden State Warriors (73-9) vs Houston Rockets (41-41)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWarriors 4-0 in the Regular Season\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Warriors just finished one of the most dominant regular seasons of all time and as mentioned in the intro setting the record for wins. They are deep, being able to play any style, but they really excel in a fast paced, crazy chaotic game. They have the reigning MVP in Stephen Curry, the greatest shooter of all time, Klay Thompson, another historical shooter and a cast of amorphous wings that can switch everywhere on defense, pass the ball well and hit the three. Finally Draymond Green is what makes them dominant in being able to defend all five positions, and acts as a release valve for Curry, rebound, pass, shoot; he is the heart and soul of the Warriors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Rockets returned their whole roster last year that got to the Western Conference Finals, but chemistry and effort issues doomed them to a bad start and underachieving all year. James Harden has been unbelievable on offense, but most of the role players have underachieved. Their defense has fallen off a cliff, but the athleticism and talent is still there. They like to play a crazy, chaotic game like the Warriors, but the Warriors just do it better. There is a chance that the athleticism and talent comes together to steal a game or two, but that probably will not happen as the rockets have proven time and again this whole season. \u003cb\u003eWarriors in 4.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2 San Antonio Spurs (67-15) vs Memphis Grizzlies (42-40)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpurs 4-0 in the Regular Season\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe San Antonio Spurs brought back their championship winning core from two years ago and added a star player in Lamarcus Aldridge. They reinvented themselves as less of a pass happy beautiful offensive team into one of the stingiest defensive team in NBA history. Kawhi Leonard has come into his own offensively and still is the most disruptive defensive player in the NBA. Parker, Ginobli and Duncan continue to defy Father Time and went almost undefeated at home. This is possibly one of the greatest regular season teams of all time, but they were overshadowed to an extent by the Warriors’ greatness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMemphis had a lot of bad luck this year. Their two best players have missed the majority of the season and they have had a record 28 players suit up for them this year. Tony Allen and Zachary Randolph have played great, but they are 2-14 in their last 16 games and do not stand a chance against the Spurs. Joerger, the coach has done an amazing job getting them into the playoffs, but they will not get very far. \u003cb\u003eSpurs in 4.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3 Oklahoma City Thunder (55-27) vs 6 Dallas Mavericks (42-40)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThunder are 4-0 in the Regular Season\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOklahoma City were able to make a comeback into the playoffs this year thanks to a mostly healthy season from Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, who provided transcendent offensive play. They have a great role player in Enes Kanter, Steven Adams to pick up offensive rebounds and Serge Ibaka who continues to defend at a high level, although his shooting has fallen off a bit. Their biggest issue remains scoring crunch time scoring as they run the predictable “give the ball to Durnat or Westbrook and watch them make something happen out of nothing” offense. Furthermore they are are guilty of not trying on defense for the full 48 minutes, but despit these shortcomings, OKC still won 55 games due to the sheer talent and athleticism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRick Carlisle has continued to do the impossible: he has taken a team of unwanted veterans and Dirk Nowitzki into the playoffs. Due to their age, the Mavericks play a very deliberate and conservative style that values every possession and reduces chaos when it comes to games. DIrk can still transcend on offense, but their defense has just not been very good this year. A young, athletic Thunder team should be able to run the Mavericks out of the building, but out of respect for the greatness in RIck Carlisle and Dirk, I predict only a gentleman’s sweep. \u003cb\u003eThunder in 5.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e4 Los Angeles Clippers (53-29) vs 5 Portland Trailblazers (44-38)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eClippers 3-1 in the Regular Season\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Clippers had another 50 win season even though arguably their best player, Blake Griffin, has missed 60% of the season. He returned recently, but has not looked the same. In his absence, Chris Paul kept the ship steady submitting an mvp-like season. Deandre Jordan has been dunking everything in sight and taking advantage of teams. JJ Reddick had a career year shooting, hitting over 200 threes and leading the league in three point percentage. Their wing play remains a question mark along with their bench, but the Clippers are talented enough to if things go their way, they should be making a deep playoff run.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePortland lost 4 starters from last years 50 win team, but kudos to them in finding a way to make the playoffs and nab the fifth seed. Damian Lillard has proven to be a superstar and taken all the snubs personally providing an amazing season. His backcourt mate CJ McCollum has become a great shooter and a dynamic of the dribble creator giving Portland two players who can carry an offense any given night. The coach Terry Stotts has been able to craft an offense behind these two dynamic players that is both fun to watch and is highly effective. However those two guards are not good defenders and will not be able to stop LA. \u003cb\u003eClippers in 6\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Yuen Woo-ping) I will admit that I was confused.  That was probably the part of me anticipating an earnest sequel to \u003ci\u003eCrouching Tiger Hidden Dragon\u003c/i\u003e (2000, dir. Ang Lee), tearing out her hair in disappointment and making as much of a protest as possible from inside an annoyed psyche.   \u003ci\u003eSword of Destiny\u003c/i\u003e is neither the high art experience that Ang Lee gave us in its predecessor in 2000 nor is it a high-camp homage to Kung Fu.  It’s a difficult film to define because it’s impossible to approach it without thinking of and referencing the first film, and the only thing that the two films have in common is the title. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eSword of Destiny \u003c/i\u003epicks up the story of Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) eighteen years after the events of the first film.  To protect the Green Sword of Destiny she leaves a life of solitude and picks up a band of misfit warriors who plan to help her save the world, basically. After that, it’s anyone’s guess as it what is going on.   As hard and cynical as this estimation might be, it’s also truthful and correct.  Michelle Yeoh and Donnie Yen (as Silent Wolf) are lovely in action. No two living Wuxia stars out there can rip out a Kung Fu battle the way these stars can with some notable exceptions (Jet Li?), but the fight scenes disappoint.  Choreography is decent but there cinematographer doesn’t seem to have a lot of reverence for the material or how magical these scenes can be in the right hands and shot through the right lens.  Connective tissue between actions sequences isn’t there, the film lacks story.  The loveliness of the original: the wind in the trees, the desert landscapes; the \u003ci\u003erealness\u003c/i\u003e of life lived as a dream – there is not a whisper of it here.  The narrative is close to non-existent and the piece feels like an opportunity lost. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are moments that work; Shu Lien’s moment of repose overlooking a misted valley is lovely.   A battle scene on an ice covered pond screams creativity and original thinking.  Pretty much every sideways glance from Donnie Yen toward an adversary works without having to add anything to it.  It’s frustrating that there wasn’t more material like this. The addition of a new sub-plot to accommodate two new young additions to the cast doesn’t help anything – the story is confusing and murky.  After taking it all in I found myself feeling taken advantage of.  It feels as if the film was made because filmmakers knew that people would see it, but that they didn’t particularly care \u003ci\u003ewhy\u003c/i\u003e people would see it.  The energy, pacing, story and beauty of the first film aren’t here, not even in an incremental amount.  Standing on its own it’s a below average Wuxia movie that doesn’t compel excitement or any kind of emotional reaction. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have a lot of admiration for filmmakers who embrace new media.  The fact that\u003ci\u003e Sword of Destiny \u003c/i\u003ereleased directly to Netflix and bypassed theaters seemed like a brilliant move. But it’s not going to last long if Netflix acquires high profile properties like this one without focusing on quality.  I came to this film with my heart open, and mid-way through I felt its doors slam shut.  If you love Kung Fu and were praying that this would be a spectacular fix, check out \u003ci\u003eThe Legend of Flying Daggers \u003c/i\u003einstead.  \u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "\"Not a Suggestion\" - why sexism in mainstream music needs to end",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By \u003c/i\u003e: Andy Talajkowski, UCLA Radio DJ (03/04/16)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I heard radio was participating in See, Recognize, Hear, a movement for female empowerment on campus, I rejoiced. At first I was excited because any active effort to promote inclusivity is dope as hell, especially in a space where I live and study. Yet the more I thought about how the campaign applied specifically to music, the more angry I became with the state of the music industry and the message perpetuated by mainstream music about how we see women. The blatant bigotry that exists against women in music today shows just how important this week is in making a platform to discuss narrow-mindedness and sexism within our culture.\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJust looking at the well known songs of the past year, the majority shamelessly drop sexist remarks. Nick Jonas thinks it’s perfectly acceptable to be a paranoid obsessive partner because, let’s face it, she’s just “too sexy, beautiful/​And everybody wants a taste.” Maroon 5 made the incredibly creepy metaphor of comparing women to prey and saying even if “you think that you can hide,” they will still hunt and eat you (gross). Drake preferred it when you waited at home for him like a “good girl” instead of doing things like not depending on him and controlling your own life. The Weeknd is “just tryna get you out the friend zone” because it’s not really worth it to have a relationship that doesn’t involve sex. And let’s not even get started on Meghan Trainor and “Dear Future Husband.” It seems the only functions women have in most popular songs is to either take care of their man or serve as objects of lust for the artist to fawn over. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe glaring problem with this message is that it maintains women should only be seen in relation to sex, and warps our perspective of how relationships are supposed to work and how women are supposed to be treated within them. Mainstream music loves to recycle the twisted romance tale where men continually fuck up and women are continually expected to forgive them and stay true to them because, apparently, that’s what love is. These alleged rules for relationships are reinforced again and again within the lyrics of popular music. And the more times we’re told this is how love is supposed to be, the more people will actually believe it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe issue doesn’t end with music - it extends to the artists themselves. It’s as grossly simple as this: Chris Brown physically assaults his girlfriend and we award him the Grammy for Best R\u0026amp;B Album, but when Kesha tries to sever her contract with her alleged rapist, we turn up empty handed. The fact is change within the music industry is not a suggestion. It is an extreme necessity. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m tired of women only being seen as bitches and hos and sex objects. I’m tired of artists profiting off depictions of women as malicious, subservient, and shallow. I’m tired of the double-edged sword of promiscuity, that awards men respect but makes women only seem undesirable. In short, I’m tired of mainstream music repeatedly failing to grant women a basic amount of respect and fairness, because the truth is it’s not that fucking difficult to do. Really.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA common method of dismissing the glaring problem that popular music these days is sexist and inexcusable is to claim, “it’s just a song.” As someone who loves and values music as an important aspect of my life and a part of how I define myself, I can tell you with confidence this is not at all “just a song.” Music and the arts in general serve as a mirror, and can show us who we are and what we believe. We can either choose to let it continue down a troublesome path, or use it as a space to express the change that needs to happen within society. It’s going to take more than a week, but we can use events like See, Recognize, Hear as a starting point to mobilize for equality. Hopefully in the future, music will reflect an environment where women are adequately and honestly portrayed as individuals beyond offensive and sexual stereotypes. \u003c/p\u003e",

Inside Union Nightclub it was darker, and then lighter, and not a single body danced. An earless creature might have guessed that Union crowds hate dancing… yet a creature with even the faintest aural faculties would have likewise been arrested on the spot. Somewhere on the stage behind a shroud of shadow Tim Hecker, the sound sorcerer, was testing his new album/spell Love Streams. It was working a sort of magic, because the crowd was stiller than doldrums, not bored but baffled––as is a bay abruptly aflood with glacial runoff (a delta’s birth). Something like sublime sonic subsumption. Obviously it was loud and I trembled from tibia to temple. Hecker also brought an atypical light show––no strobes, no seizures––just nine horizontal racks of extremely versatile, baseball-sized LEDs, variably hued to paint-palate harmony and pouring into the venue’s swampy haze. \u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"573\" data-orig-height=\"410\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d215114a568bc828e833ec25917fcd6e/tumblr_inline_o6bzh3HYHS1qhakxc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"573\" data-orig-height=\"410\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eLove Streams was released a day later, so lacking prior exposure to the album (didn’t hear the leak), I couldn’t deduce the set list, save a single and a few older songs. I suspected my memory of the music would be vague without tethers to familiar material, but a pristine listen was appealing. I was correct about forgetting a lot of specific sound, but the show’s visual aspect and general thrust left a potent impression to enhanced my later experience of the album. In a Rolling Stone interview, Hecker lists a few functions of the haze and rich LEDs, as directed:\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eat audience: hypnotic or “narcotic” openers of “third ears”\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eand away from artist: “to circumvent the silhouetted, hunched ego of the knob-turner”\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat the album, a chunk of scintillating sound, is encapsulated by darkness (opener “Obsidian Counterpart” and closer “Black Phase”) connects Hecker’s shadowy shroud to the work: the artist is hidden when the record spins and perhaps should be in concert as well. Concealed from the work, Hecker’s physical figure vacates an outlined space, which the work refills. You can bet that if possible, the reclusive Thomas Pynchon would erase \u003ca href=\"http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1902376_1902378_1902438,00.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehis rare youthful image\u003c/a\u003e from our brains and leave literary style as sole trace of his character. I guess to a small extent this is Hecker’s aim. Love Streams’ stylistic complexity reflects Hecker well enough––as is usual in his work, no detail is insignificant.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThus I wondered if the LEDs, a collaboration with visual artist Marcel Weber, were arranged to resemble a pattern of MIDI notes. Given the compositional methods behind this album, it’s not implausible: Hecker used Melodyne software to extract choral motifs from Renaissance church-music––Josquin des Prez pieces––and convert them into MIDI scores. Melodyne is apparently controversial and viewed by some as a plundering tool, but Hecker’s use of it is meaningful and constructive. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe celebrates technology’s expansion of creative endeavors. “Digital audio,” Hecker tells Rolling Stone, is “the great plastic sculptural medium.” Software like Melodyne and DAWs facilitate reevaluations of our musical past; computers are reanimating tools, by which the history of sound is rendered inexhaustibly malleable. The digital advantage is even too much: Hecker quipped in a FACT Magazine interview about the stress of choosing between “40 types of zithers,” all computer interfaces. To navigate this abundance he adheres to a method of “constraint… omitting… and putting on horse blinders.” This Cage-like hybrid of purpose and chance steers him from the unreasonable, unhealthy cathexis over perfection and originality. Idealists, with noses in the air and heads in the stratosphere will still scoff at anything less than “genius.” But critical consideration of artistic originality has broadened enough that an inspired invention is no more valuable than a warped, repurposed interpretation, perhaps even a serendipitous rehashing. Source is no richer than process and product, and all are mediated by factors we cannot know or change. There is no reason de Prez and Hecker shouldn’t share a page in a\u003ca href=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C4M0QR85L._SX258_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg\" class=\"hoverZoomLink\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e 22nd Century Eyewitness book about VOICE.\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"572\" data-orig-height=\"441\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/33a867d5ce984d6b8d4068823c52668c/tumblr_inline_o6bzhomuTt1qhakxc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"572\" data-orig-height=\"441\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf corporate use of deep analytics for profit is data-mining at its most industrial level, then Hecker’s rush into sonic information is its simple counterpart, the exuberant prospector. A reporter from The FADER brings up minimalism and Hecker quickly makes it clear that Love Streams is not ascribable to any minimalist school in particular: the album is not very minimalist besides its general adherence to one key and occasional limited note range. However, it is relatively minimal–– its content, relative to the profuse potential content it faced in production, is a lithe current through a sea of possible sound. That sea is knowable only in streams, for its whole is as daunting and excessive as a corporate data cache. It’s also minimal relative to his old work, and less full-bodied. Compare “Whitecaps of White Noise II” from Harmony in Ultraviolet with “Black Phase” and you will find the same note progression, treated in the former as a full-bodied chunk of sound and in the latter more delicately as a thin tonal line. In general Love Streams exhibits more space and restraint than Hecker’s last few albums, but his penchant for emotionally engrossing, climactic crescendos remains.  “Violet Monumental” is the most intense example of this: it ceaselessly ascends, stacking notes up like purple obelisk bricks. Here the near-homonym of violet/violent is important, as well as the phallic implications of tall, manmade structures. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHecker is no doubt aware of his compositional obsession with sonic climaxes and power, and addresses the subject in different ways: with Ravedeath, 1972, he interprets the musical “drop” as the crucial destruction of tension in sound waves and affective audience alike. Virgins asserts that truly political art (who could mistake \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tim_Hecker_-_Virgins.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe draped shape of Ali Shallal al-Qaisi on its cover?\u003c/a\u003e) should make no effort to ameliorate discontent if it seeks to promote material change. And Love Streams’ treatment of vocal pitch and its connection to puberty lends corporeal significance to the “drop.” “Castrati Stack,” the album’s lead single, is the most overt example: castrati were medieval choir boys, castrated to provide an ecclesiastical stock of permanent alto/soprano singers. The song is driven by a synth that hops between the same notes in different octaves like the tonal demarcations of maturity, yet floats continuously on boyish lamentations. The delicate and innately youthful character of the higher registers and the visceral power of low notes are dialectically related in the same way adulthood is often reflective of youth. Hecker brings up an old adage with The FADER reporter: “foster the child in you always.” So when “Voice Crack” follows spilling out of the tumult, there is no feeling of absolute transition, but of comfort; a calm acceptance diffuses into the garbled autotune. Every adult at some point sounded like \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR4ri3rpVZY\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSquidward’s clarinet\u003c/a\u003e, and this is a sort of beautification of the cracking voice. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhere the themes of puberty and the internet intersect, Hecker seems to strike a similar chord as Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never)’s Garden of Delete, released last November. Both artists (who are friends and occasional collaborators) advocate widespread use of digital audio editing technology, whether by established artists looking to diversify their sound or kids with a laptop and budding interest in music. They revere and fear the internet for its ability to educate or corrupt, and it’s no surprise that the Edenic myth is pertinent to Lopatin and Hecker’s work. Its relevance to Garden of Delete is pretty clear, but Hecker doesn’t incorporate it explicitly. A quote from the FADER interview, though,  could link them: “you need to step back and garden, but not that fruit tree. Take care of your carrots or something.” He’s talking about foregoing reliance on brute sonic force and being attentive to more important details––but we could easily apply this to the societal obsession with the Fruit of Good and Evil, sexual knowledge and its convoluted online presence. Taking care of your carrots means assigning less disturbing gravity to, if I may be permitted to use a not-so-inclusive metaphor here, the moment one’s voice and balls drop. Love Streams flows naturally, beautifully––as the varied emissions of puberty should feel.\u003c/p\u003e",

Yndi Halda is a band that has extreme emphasis on the instrumentals so to but it simply, this song is epic! I want to describe them as the rock version of Sigor Ros. \u0026ldquo;Together Those Leaves\u0026rdquo; starts off real chill and relaxing but when you get to the end of the 5 minutes, you feel like you\u0026rsquo;ve just trekked the trail of your life time.

Uptempo, super groovy, great hooks with a late nite feel. 80s inspired with modern flare. Solid production/mixing as well. Lovespeake is a brand new artist who\u0026rsquo;s released two other singles, \u0026ldquo;DNA\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Dreamer.\u0026rdquo; Both are pretty decent, so if you like Tightrope I\u0026rsquo;d check em out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eShining Bird - Helluva Lot EP\u003cbr/\u003eRecommended Song: River Mouth\u003cbr/\u003eGenre: Indie Rock\u003cbr/\u003eAnother great band!

One of my favorite things about this band is how deep the vocals are. But even more than that, their music has this sense of simplicity to it that gives it such a sweet sound.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eElvis Depressedly - Holo Pleasures / California Dreamin\u0026rsquo;\u003cbr/\u003eRecommended Song: Slip\u003cbr/\u003eGenre: Lo-Fi, Pop\u003cbr/\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve always loved Elvis Depressedly\u0026rsquo;s lo-fi sounds and he nails it again with his newest single \u0026ldquo;Slip\u0026rdquo;. Don\u0026rsquo;t know if his new album is being released via Orchid Tapes as well\u0026hellip;but hopefully yes because that label is great. Anyway, listen to this song if you want to feel like an emotional artist trying to sing the feels away.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eLeyya - Spanish Disco (out May 20)\u003cbr/\u003eRecommended Song: Butter\u003cbr/\u003eGenre: Dream Pop\u003cbr/\u003eI really enjoyed this track - it starts off dissonant, slow, and dreamlike and picks up to a catchier upbeat rhythm when the beat drops. The mix of experimental electronic and more typical pop rhythms makes this weird enough to be interesting but still easy and fun to listen to.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eEd Tullett  - Fiancé\u003cbr/\u003eRecommended Song: Saint\u003cbr/\u003eGenre: Electronica/Folk\u003cbr/\u003eThis album is a weird mix of genres but Tullett succeeds in luring the listener into his strange haunting world. Every track is a sort of dreamy electronic soundscape supplemented by unexpectedly folk-ish vocals. Some tracks are more folky and some are more purely electronic, but the album is still cohesive and lovely. Really, really great album and definitely worth a listen.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eTacocat - Lost Time\u003cbr/\u003eRecommended Song: Dana Katherine Sculy\u003cbr/\u003eGenre: Garage Pop Punk\u003cbr/\u003eTacocat remind me alot of the Go-Go\u0026rsquo;s but with more of a garage rock/pop punk sound. Their lyrics are genuine and funny and feminist (see the ode to Scully from the X-Files, \u0026ldquo;Dana Katherine Scully\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;Men Explain Things to Me\u0026rdquo;), but there are really sweet melodies here too. This is a really fun, catchy record that Burger Records fans will probably like even though Tacocat is on Hardly Art. My other favorite tracks are 4 (\u0026ldquo;I Hate the Weekend\u0026rdquo;) and 11 (\u0026ldquo;Night Swimming\u0026rdquo;).\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eCate Le Bon - Crab Day\u003cbr/\u003eRecommended Song: Love in Not Love\u003cbr/\u003eGenre: Experimental Folk/Country\u003cbr/\u003eThe entirety of Crab Day had me questioning whether I actually enjoyed what I was listening to, yet its appealing eccentricity kept me captivated throughout the album. Cate Le Bon\u0026rsquo;s high, haunting vocals are set against a disjointed experimental country influenced sound. If Nico and Hank Williams collaborated on an album, and then that album took some weird psychedelics, Crab Day would be the result. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if this ends up on a future Wes Anderson soundtrack. Give if a listen if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for something delightfully weird.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By\u003c/i\u003e: Anastasia Gershman, UCLA Radio Digital Press Staff (04/26/16)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1024\" data-orig-width=\"693\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/47d322636b379f3d4d1f6ec62486b582/tumblr_inline_o69e95h64H1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1024\" data-orig-width=\"693\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eLast Saturday night the plan was to run out to the local mega theater, put down the forty dollars it would cost for the two of us to see JUNGLE BOOK, and try not to look longingly at the folks passing by with their eighteen dollar Raisinets and twelve dollar waters.  It’s a pretty standard Saturday night for those of us who love movies and who also like to go to really nice theaters.  But after a long week of lines, traffic and annoying miscommunication, I just couldn’t bring myself to hit the mega movie branch near me.   We regrouped and impulsively I picked a small Spanish film that was playing at the local Laemmle.  It looked fun.  It was playing in a theater made for movie heads.  My companion gave the idea a thumbs up and off we went.  Now you know the story of how I came to see the sweet, lovely, and utterly funny slapstick comedy that is *MI GRAN NOCHE (2015 – D. Alex de la Iglesia).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009A film set on the set of a New Year’s Eve television special gone terribly wrong, MI GRAN NOCHE functions as an ensemble piece that extracts a large part of its humor from Spanish pop culture.  Helmed by a sociopathic seventy-year-old pop singer determined to stay on top, the cast ranges from a Justin Bieber knock-off whose compulsive pelvic thrusting in any situation or circumstance becomes a bad joke gone good.  Add to this a beautiful jinx; a mob of striking television workers; a riot outside in the parking lot; a celebrity assistant gone berserk; two gold-diggers with a uniquely gross plan for a big payday; and a psychotic superfan determined to end the night with a bang.   All of this taking place on a production set where the extras have been held for over two weeks without a break or even sleep – makes for some great and outrageous comedy.  Spanish singing star Raphael plays the sociopathic Alphonso – which I only divulge so those who might choose to see the film can look up his career on Wikipedia before they go.  If you don’t understand who this singer is in the context of Spanish pop culture, some of the humor might be lost, and it’s honestly too good to miss.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The story is brightly paced and enacted. The script buzzes with sharp, insightful jokes as well as expertly executed slapstick and bawdy humor.  Definitely not for children but a dirty and ribald roller coaster ride for adults.  This piece falls into a really interesting subset of Spanish comedy/satire that takes on ideas about contemporary media practices, the nature of celebrity, fandom and the changing economic landscape of the already economically devastated Spain.  It also delivers on dirty jokes, alternative sexuality and the isolation of lonely people in an increasingly impersonal world.  It’s a lot for one hundred minutes, but director Alex de la Iglesia puts it together beautifully.  Raphael stands out as an artist unafraid to take a shot at his own public persona, and Blanca Suarez shines as the unbelievably pretty, clumsy and shockingly unlucky Paloma. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009JUNGLE BOOK will be around in theaters for a few minutes more.  *MI GRAN NOCHE, on the other hand, will probably last another weekend (maybe two) in U.S. theaters.  If you want to try something different, beautifully done and off the beaten path of the movie megaplex, please check this one out.  Absolutely worth the cost of admission and then some. \u003c/p\u003e",

Their self titled debut album is one of the best albums of 2011 and it was during that year that true college rock (what we now call indie rock) ended.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI didn’t remember Yuck being so garage rock-like so I was rather surprised when I first listened to Stranger Things. It sounded like the band was going down the route of teenage riot rock, similar to the likes of Burger Records artists. But when I got to the third track “Like A Moth”, I was immediately reminded of what drew me to their debut album. Yuck has a knack for writing songs that have a mellow rock base, almost like a modern The Smashing Pumpkins.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e“As I Walk Away” reminds me so much of Fleetwood Mac. While the vocals don’t have the Stevie Nicks power chords, the female vocalist does have this mysterious draw to her voice that works so well with soft pop rock that Fleetwood Mac owned. The reverb on the guitar on this track give it a bit of a psychedelic sound.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStranger Things is definitely a strange album. It has music ranging from soft pop rock to teenage riot rock. Personally, I’m a fan of the more mellow tracks on this album, which is what I gravitated towards. But, Yuck stays pretty true to their sound on their debut and it’s impressive that even with the six year gap, they can maintain that distinct quality about their music. What I love the most about this album is that you can hear how each song is carefully crafted. With every layer of sound, there is intention behind it. This album almost makes time stand absolutely still and throw you back to the good old days of college indie rock.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFavorite Tracks:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike A Moth\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m Ok\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs I Walk Away\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDown\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSwirling\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYr Face\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By\u003c/i\u003e: Alison Chi, UCLA Radio DJ (04/19/16)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBack in March, Night Moves finally released their second full-length Pennied Days via Domino Recording Co. The Minneapolis-band finally reappeared after the four year gap between the release of their first album Colored Emotions, which came out in 2012. Since then, they’ve been keeping it relatively low-key, mostly playing shows around Minnesota and other Midwest cities.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI first heard this band back in 2013 and from the moment I heard them, I fell in love. Needless to say, I’ve been waiting for Pennied Days for years and now that it’s finally here, my heart is soaring. To be honest, I was scared about this album because my love for Night Moves had cultivated for three years and I was afraid that I’d be disappointed. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince Colored Emotions, Night Moves’ lineup changed slightly with Mark Ritsema leaving the band to pursue is own project Suzie; however, he is still featured on Pennied Days. Night Moves released their first single “Denise, Don’t Wanna See You Cry” in January and I was thrown aback. The single is a lot heavier on the synths than I had remembered and it was so clear that there was a darker and more serious sound than before. This single was a signal that Night Moves had evolved their sound into something bold and exhilarating.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eSongs like “Border On Border”, “Kind Luck”, and “Hiding In The Melody” are reminiscent of their first album. I found that “Kind Luck” was definitely more soulful but Night Moves still rocks their tint of psychedelia into the track. “Border On Border” has been a fan favorite for the longest time and it is, in my opinion, a song that really shows how innovative Night Moves is as a band. I remember first hearing this song on their KEXP session, and it was that song that made me fall in love with the band. For me, the studio version on Pennied Days sounds too polished and I prefer the rawer sound that was in the KEXP session.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DehwuNPFs1DE\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ehwuNPFs1DE?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut besides bringing back their classic sound, Night Moves also has new sounds that they’ve been working with. I found “Carl Sagan”, “Leave Your Light On” and “Staurolite Stroll” to be particularly memorable. “Carl Sagan” was the second single released from Pennied Days and it hits their older sound better but as with “Denise, Don’t Wanna See You Cry”, this song clearly shows how they’ve evolved. Lead John Pelant is the main mastermind behind all of Night Moves’ tracks, and it’s obvious that he spent the last three years perfecting Night Moves’ new sound. I was genuinely surprised by “Leave Your Light On” because it has such an earthy and pure sound. Of all their tracks, I think “Leave Your Light On” is one of the most honest and stripped down songs. It’s refreshing to say the least and so well executed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter listening to Pennied Days in full, I can safely and happily say that Night Moves is still one of my favorite bands. Their sound is unique beyond description — there truly is no other band that sounds like them. Pennied Days was released on March 25, 2016 and I remember running out of my brother’s house to go to the Amoeba in SF to buy it. I now, proudly, own both Night Moves albums and I couldn’t be happier.\u003c/p\u003e",

Active since 2002, Krgovich made a name for himself as a songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and vocalist of indie pop groups NO KIDS, GIGI, and P:ANO. He’s now found success as a solo artist blending R\u0026amp;B, soft rock, and sophisticated pop.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Hills develops this genre morphing even further, incorporating lush strings, horns, and jazz guitar into sleek pop and late-night R\u0026amp;B melodies. Krgovich’s vocals are front-and-center, which he delivers with sublime sensitivity, predominately clear and soothing with aptly timed crescendos. The songs can be divided into three groups: upbeat, adult alternative pop à la Prefab Sprout (“The Place Goes Quiet,” “Mountain of Song,” “Out of Work Jazz Singer”); spacious and refined ballads (“The Hills,” “Sunset Towers,” “Written in the Wind”); and atmospheric, string-based instrumentals (“Backlot Detail,” “Rock’s Detail,” “Moon Detail”). The delicate, downtempo tracks are spaced evenly, helping to accentuate the quality songwriting on display in the pop-oriented songs. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eThroughout the album, Krgovich wrestles with the contrasting beauty and darkness of the enigmatic LA sprawl. He paints the lyrics with urban ennui, somber loneliness, chance encounters, and portraits of the city. The themes are relatable to anyone seeking beauty, meaning, and one’s place in metropolitan society.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUltimately, The Hills is a companion album to On Sunset, but it’s anything but an afterthought. The care that Krgovich and his team put into crafting the album is evident both in the individual songs and the overall aesthetic. Although some listeners may be turned-off by the multiple instrumental tracks, I think they deepen the scope of the album, and thus I’d recommend listening to each song in order for the full effect. If that\u0026rsquo;s not your style, The Hills still contains a few gems that are worth singling out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e7.5/10\u003c/p\u003e",

Behind bandanas and blistered toes, it was clear that this venue contained the most diverse lineup and audience of the entire 72 hours. In a perfectly arranged spectacle, the stage cleared from the rambunctious Matt \u0026amp; Kim balloon-poppers to 100 BPM ravers shuffling to Major Lazer. But right as the sun was collected behind the desert landscape, the best performance of Coachella history moved the crowd to emotions they didn’t know they are capable of feeling. Sia proved that the best Coachella performances don’t arise from Vegas-Style light shows and cameos by guest artists, but instead, the raw talent that can only be delivered through in the moment scenes of vulnerability by live performance actors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSia’s 13-song hour set wasn’t meant to entertain or evoke good vibes. The performance opened up our childhood wounds, forcing the audiences’ hidden fears and memories to be brought to the frontal lobe and be recognized. This journey forced us to confront the thoughts we try to forget, proving that the human experience is meant to be painful and shared. Sia tells the story of childhood abuse and feeling trapped by her father, but rather than showing it through her own perspective, she shifted from the view of her father as a child experiencing a neglected upbringing to her own childhood and adult self desperately wishing for reconciliation. As the first song, “Air” belted through Sia’s lungs, the Coachella audience immediately knew that this would be the most liberating experience of pain and pleasure. In just an hour’s time, Sia was able to demonstrate the complications of a father-daughter relationship and the meaning of forgiveness. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn true Sia fashion, her face and body was covered in dark shadows, hiding behind the exaggerated sharp lines of her girly-bubble dress and rigid black-and-white short wig. This minimalist feature only heightened the entire performance as the infamous dancers who appear in her music videos- Maddie Ziegler, Paul Dano, Gaby Hoffman, and actor Kristin Wiig (who played Sia)-  were shown on the main screens in similar attire in pre-filmed videos, while the live dancers performed simultaneously in unison to the movements on the screens. Kristin’s acting range impressively left the audience speechless as she portrayed every emotional extreme of the set from bliss to devastation, where at one point she was left sobbing and shaking uncontrollably. Meanwhile, as the pre-filmed videos appeared on the big screens, the dancers took to the stage in a contortionist method of extreme flexibility and perfectly synched movements for the entire hour, portraying the notion that life moves quickly and pain can be endless. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe audience was left standing in tears as a collective body of conflicting emotion. The character development was so perfectly built during the entire performance through the shared views of Sia’s father and herself that it was painful to decide which character was the protagonist or villain, making it so that when the lights finally dimmed to the darkness on stage and the characters took their final bow- we will spend the rest of our lives deciding. \u003c/p\u003e",

A born musician if there ever was one, Kline began uploading songs under the name Frankie Cosmos in mid adolescence before releasing her debut LP \u003ci\u003eZentropy\u003c/i\u003e in 2014. The album made waves in the indie world, notable for its heartfelt and graceful songwriting. Two years and one EP later, a bolder, more confident Kline has pushed her craft to new heights on \u003ci\u003eNext Thing\u003c/i\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike \u003ci\u003eZentropy\u003c/i\u003e, the album clocks in at less than thirty minutes, but it would be nothing short of tragic to fault it on its length. The songs all hover around two minutes long and incorporate clean, well-structured melodies that surround Kline’s delicate vocals with fitting guitar, keyboard, bass, and drums. The music’s brevity has prompted some to label her a minimalist, but I think this misses the mark. Kline’s music isn’t purposely short, as if the original songs were longer and the group tried to cut them down. Rather, they’re exactly as long as they need to be, as the ideas and emotions that inspired them demand. Consequently, the album offers an incredibly rich listening experience. The power of each song is tangible. I often found myself double-checking the track length, wondering how I could be so blown away by such comparably short recordings. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKline’s maturity and poise throughout the album is striking. Full of meditations on vulnerability, stinging regrets, and a promising future, \u003ci\u003eNext Thing\u003c/i\u003e excels at transforming everyday experiences into elegant sketches of humanity. Delicate and melancholic when it needs to be, energetic at other times, the album feels like a splash of cool water on the face – refreshing, serene, alive. Kline writes candidly, with just a pure desire to share her life through music. Regardless of the listener’s age, it’s hard to pass through the album without feeling emotionally connected to her in some way – a rare feat indeed. Penetrating, unassuming, and beautiful, \u003ci\u003eNext Thing\u003c/i\u003e delivers on all fronts. For music fans, nothing could be more rewarding than witnessing a true artist hitting her stride. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e9/10\u003c/p\u003e",

The whiny vocals and poppy-Phoenix sound of their debut actively irritated me, and their image seemed almost indistinguishable from some of the other indie-pop bands like the Neighbourhood or Walk the Moon that were blowing up a couple of years ago. However, lead singer Matty Healy’s charismatic press bites intrigued me, and I’m down for any and all attempts to combine 90’s R\u0026amp;B, emo, shoegaze and “John Hughes movies”. Not only does Healy actually pull these different sounds together organically on \u003ci\u003eI Like It..\u003c/i\u003e, but he does so with wit and heart, making it one of the most ambitious pop records released this year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eHealy has been pretty open in the press about his struggles with depression and drug abuse, and he touches on these topics in most of the tracks here. “She Lays Down” is an empathetic portrait of his mother, who suffered postpartum depression after his birth, while “Nana” is an ode to his grandmother in the wake of her death. On “The Ballad of Me and My Brain” he imagines trying to literally find his brain, opening with the line, “I think I’ve gone mad/isn’t that so sad?”. Lead single “Love Me” is a tongue in cheek look at the almost One-Direction-level of fame the band struggled with during the making of the record: “You\u0026rsquo;ve been reading \u0026lsquo;bout yourself/ On a plane, fame for a change/ Caught up in fashion, Karcrashian panache and a bag of bash for passion/You\u0026rsquo;ve got a beautiful face but got nothing to say.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eClearly, the 1975 have plenty to say. But their message falls to connect on a couple of tracks, which are just not on par with the rest of the album musically or lyrically. Two of the three instrumental tracks don’t really go anywhere and “This Must Be My Dream” and \u0026ldquo;Paris\u0026rdquo; are predictable and dull synth pop retreads. However, most of the record is definitely worth a listen (especially “The Sound” and “Somebody Else”).  I recommend it to pop fans or anyone who enjoyed Carly Rae Jepsen’s “EMOTION”-  \u003ci\u003eI Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware Of It \u003c/i\u003ewears its heart on its sleeve and transcends genre.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e8/10\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By\u003c/i\u003e: Sophia Forino, UCLA Radio DJ (03/07/16)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLast Sunday I found myself flocking back to the venue that, at this point, may be considered my home away from home, The Observatory in Santa Ana. I was there to see The Drums in their first of two nights playing at the venue. While this was my fourth time seeing them this year (they seem to be on the same festival circuit I am on), I am constantly reminded of why I love them the second they step onto the stage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause I was a little tired and not in the mood to be standing on tip-toe or get lost in densely-packed pit, I decided to lay low and check out the venue’s new side balconies to watch from above. My plus-one and I got great standing seats right along the railing of the balcony, giving us a fantastic view of a show and the audience. To me, it was even more amazing because at my 5 feet 2 inches, it is rare that I ever actually get to \u003ci\u003esee \u003c/i\u003ea concert, so I will definitely keep these balconies in mind for future shows.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e As soon as The Drums came on stage the atmosphere in the room completely changed. I have never seen an audience scream or reach towards the stage so enthusiastically. Part of it might have to do with leading man Jonny Pierce’s eerie and drawling voice and lyrical yet seance-y dance moves but it seemed as though every person inside the venue knew every word to every song they performed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey opened with “Bell Laboratories” a strange song that seemingly repeats the line “get back in the car but I ran so far” and immediately segued into one of my favorite songs “I Can’t Pretend”. They continued with some of their most popular songs such as “Money,” “Days,” and “What You Were”. \u0009\u0009One of the downfalls, I felt, in this set was that they played too many of their better-known songs in the beginning and end rather than dispersing them throughout the entirety of the show. By the middle-end, I felt almost a boring lull as they played too many consecutive, lesser-known, slow ballads. The rest of the crowd, however, didn’t seem to mind for they never stopped singing along and pushing each other to get to the front to possibly touch Jonny’s hand (another perk of watching from the balcony). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Overall, The Drums put on a fantastic show as they always do. They have such a dedicated fan base (especially in Southern California) that induces an energy and electricity during their shows. Even if you had no clue who the band was, experiencing the crowd who worships them will leave you with a lasting impression that The Drums are a band to look out for. While they definitely have made some big moves from where they were a few years ago, I have no doubt that The Drums will continue to rise and bring more ear traffic towards the Surf Pop genre in the years to come. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Burger Records is a label that constantly adds to their artist roster and continuously puts out releases from up-and-coming artists and LA favorites including FIDLAR, The Orwells, The Growlers, The Memories, and many many more beloved acts. Hosts of the show, Joe and Issa, never fail to provide listeners with new and exciting Burger signees and affiliates to check out with packed weekly playlists that will have you jumping up and down your seat for two hours straight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks to Joe, Issa, and UCLA Radio Alumni Jake Hook who started Burger Radio U about a year or two ago, UCLA Radio has established a unique connection with Burger Radio U that brings in fantastic acts into the station nearly every week. Acts who have guested the show in the past for an in-studio performance include Colleen Green, The Memories, Part Time, Franky Flowers, Vision, and L.A. Witch to name a few! Just this past weekend, Joe, Issa, their interns Nicole and Kyle, and all BRU listeners were treated to a special acoustic set from Kera Armendariz of Kera and the Lesbians!

Last week I casually started with their new release Painting With, and quickly realized the atrocity I had committed by ignoring the literal dozens of times I had been recommended to look them up. Attempting to define Animal Collective as a genre is ambitious to say the least; they’ve been called everything from freak folk to experimental pop to unconventional psych-rock. I won’t attempt to label them as anything but profoundly weird and extraordinarily catchy. Painting With starts off strong with the oozing, energetic pop single “FloriDada” that instantly caught my attention. From there the album goes down a bit of an experimental rabbit hole, but manages to pull back up with track “Bagels in Kiev.” Ending on a high note with “Recycling,” I finished my Animal Collective experience with a satisfaction I rarely get from listening to an entire album. Given this is the tenth album put out by the music group, I admit there’s plenty of material I haven’t listened to that might affect my opinion of Painting With; many Animal Collective fans have found themselves to be rather disappointed with the new album, claiming the originality and creativity of their previous work seems to have vanished. Given the most intriguing part of Animal Collective could be that, in the words of critic Jamieson Cox, “nothing about their artistry felt predictable or stable,” I can concede that Painting With might feel a bit safe. The group said they was influenced by the Ramones while creating the album, which shows in the short two to four minute songs that deviate from the convoluted, drawn out tracks some fans may be used to. Listening with a fresh ears, however, I thoroughly enjoyed the new release, and consider it a perfect recommendation to that one quirky friend who knits their own clothes and likes taking psychedelic drugs. For those who may be doubtful, I encourage you to take a chance on Painting With - you may be pleasantly surprised. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Although she did not perform, her presence sent a powerful message - punk isn’t dead. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The punk scene, since its inception in the 1970s, has evolved rapidly, and more recently moved into more than questionable territory. With Green Day and Blink 182 ringing in our ears, many of us are wondering if the dumbed down, commercialized pop punk tracks of late have led us to a point of no return. Considering parents used to send their kids to mental institutions for sporting spiked hair and safety pins, the fact that 5 Seconds of Summer thinks they’re “punk” is rather distressing. I, myself, have had a share of modern punk experiences I’d rather forget. Growing up near 924 Gilman, considered the home of pop punk, there were many times I’d stand in the venue on a Friday night, listening to white suburban boys scream into the microphone and tell their parents to fuck off, usually while the parents were in the crowd, capturing the entire performance on a camcorder. As I watched the “You don’t get me, Dad!” declaration of teenage angst, I often wondered to myself, “What the fuck are these kids even complaining about?”  \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Punk has continually served as a space over the past several decades where musicians could voice their opinions against unjust economic, political, and social climates. The Sex Pistols stood up for the overburdened working class; straight edge took on the drug epidemic of the 80s; the D.C. scene protested against racism and apartheid; Jello Biafra asserted the importance of freedom of expression; riot grrrl fought the patriarchy. Again and again, movements within the punk scene dragged different issues into the spotlight and refused to stop until everyone got a glimpse. Yet now, when there seems to be an overwhelming abundance of things wrong in the world (i.e. the refugee crisis, the NSA, police brutality, religious intolerance, income inequality, immigration, Donald Trump - need I go on?) the fact that All Time Low exists seems to show punk indeed has lost its ability to confront society and all its bullshit. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYet right when it seemed all hope was gone, three members of the band Pussy Riot were arrested for performing a punk prayer against current Russian president Vladimir Putin in Cathedral of Christ the Savior. The group was already known for their public punk protests, but after being sentenced to two years in prison for what many considered to simply be an exercise of free speech, they became internationally known. Widespread outcry against the unjust ruling morphed into protests across the world. For what seemed like the first time in decades, people mobilized over music. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The significance behind Maria Alyokhina’s visit is that she proves there’s still a place in music to have a voice that’s punk and political. While most mainstream “punk” seems to have become apathetic, there’s many still fighting to maintain its revolutionary qualities. The fact that punk can make the president of Russia shit his pants means it still has a fighting chance to continue in the 21st century. \u003c/p\u003e",

The name itself is based on the condition of synesthesia where a person experiences multiple senses at once, such as seeing different colors while hearing different types of music. The songs seem to take after this condition, blending R\u0026amp;B elements, electronics, and a more sophisticated sound with their established retro indie aesthetic. This seems to have been a focus of the group, with Spies commenting “We wanted to destroy the barriers between all the things we keep separate in our daily lives.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe result is 9 well-crafted, self-contained modern pop songs – sharp and punchy, bright but not blinding. The electronics compliment the guitars, drums, and vocals in subtle, exquisite ways. Beautiful melodies and climaxes appear in the midst of rolling soundscapes. At times groovy and danceable (“Oil Show”, “Milky White”), mellow and serene (“Butter”, “Separate”, “Fancy Cherries”), catchy and infectious (“Juicy”, “Come and Go”), no one theme dominates the album. Instead, the grandness of the songs is well met by subtle arrangements that let Ellison’s radiant vocals shine true despite the varying emotional palette.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough not particularly revolutionary, \u003ci\u003eSynesthetica\u003c/i\u003e nevertheless is a wonderful addition to the sophisticated, modern indie pop canon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRating: 8/10 \u003c/p\u003e",

Although indie-electronic music, as Bear Hands’ genre is loosely described as, is not the type of sound I typically gravitate towards, I had high hopes for You’ll Pay For This, the group’s first LP release in two years. But sadly, the lead singer’s angsty tone coupled with the overall aggressively techno backing music created a listening experience that was uninspired and distasteful.\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst off, the mediocre lyrical content. Eleven out of the twelve songs are defiant odes to rebellious, controversial youth. The one song that diverges from this theme is “Like Me Like That,” and it is about a girl who loves the narrator because he is a rebellious, controversial youth. And while I can certainly appreciate music written about nonconformity and the struggle of finding oneself, the lyrics of this album are largely repetitive and flat. (“Making love is fine/but all I want is to forget/how old I am” is a line from one of their singles “2AM.” Well Bear Hands, all I want is to forget how uninspired your writing is.) Ultimately the messages of the music come across as merely whiny. But perhaps even more embarrassing for Bear Hands than their lyrics is their lack of impact on the listener. Thrashing drums and slamming electric guitar chords are intended to startle, but the different hooks and melodies muddily blur into one another throughout the album, making it so that no song truly stands out. Conversely, “The Shallows” and “Purpose Filled Life,” which appear to be the designated slower, emotionally meaningful songs, are quietly soft but without soulful depth. Only “Winner’s Circle” exists clearly in my memory, and that’s because that is the track I found most unpleasant to hear. This album manages to be a disagreeable experience while one listens to it, but still forgettable and insignificant in the long run.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs I read over my review, I almost feel guilty for how strongly negative my opinion of this record is. I will say that if someone is a fan of Hippo Campus or Grouplove, but wishes that these bands would incorporate more garage pop punk vocals like those of Blink-182, this could be the album for that person. In another attempt at positivity, I will also say that You’ll Pay For This has the potential to be a great soundtrack for a young adult indie movie, one in which the protagonist is a frustrated skateboarding teen trying to “take down the system” and “live in the moment.” But until that film is produced, I will not be listening to Bear Hands’ newest LP anytime soon.\u003c/p\u003e",

The first single “Spirits” off the album is the now notorious song that has taken over my daily focus. I have quite literally have had Strumbella “spirits in my head” from this song. This is the kind of song (and probably album) that before you know it is going to follow you everywhere and have you singing to yourself without you noticing. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo be honest, I didn’t know the Strumbellas before stumbling across “Spirits,” which might make it seem kind of peculiar why I am so excited for the album if I haven’t been a long-term fan anticipating it. Since hearing “Spirits,” and instantly having it stuck in my head, I have gone back and adventured through some of the Strumbellas other music. Everything I’ve heard has made me happy and want to dance around a little bit. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou may be wondering, who are the Strumebellas and why should you care? Well, let me tell you a little bit more about who they are and what makes them special. They are a six-piece band straight out of Lindsay, Ontario (Canada). Their first EP was released in 2009 and since then they have continued to expand their fan base. They began in Canada and quickly spread across North America. As a testament to their talent, they won six awards on their second (and most recent) album \u003ci\u003eWe Still Move On Dance Floors\u003c/i\u003e, including a JUNO award! The Strumebellas exemplify the magic that can happen when six talented musicians come together to create something special. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you haven’t noticed yet, I’M EXCITED FOR THIS FRIDAY! Keep an eye out for the release :)!\u003c/p\u003e",

Having drawn artists like Rødhåd, Hot Chip, Four Tet, and Marcel Dettmann – among others – to Los Angeles in the past, Prototype is a massive force to be reckoned with in the city’s electronic scene. Where a large majority of LA’s electronic shows are thrown out of warehouses, Prototype operates out of the Arts District’s Lot 613. The space offers the best of both worlds in that the legal and permanent nature of the venue allows for an impressive sound system to be set up, while the energy remains that of an underground warehouse party.\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe outdoor area, as expansive as the indoor space, helps contribute to this effect and provides a respite from the unrelenting techno like that which was spinning on Saturday night. The outdoor bar and food vendor were a nice contribution to the space. The venue’s geographic placement amidst a plethora of warehouses contributed to the venue’s refreshing energy of a warehouse/club hybrid. The dark club was permeated by dim light reflecting off of the disco ball and from a few light-filled balloons that ravers tossed around the crowd. The balcony at the back of the venue offered a nice perspective on the large space and was a calmer oasis for those that didn’t feel like battling the massive crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/israelvines\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIsrael Vines\u003c/a\u003e filled up the enormous venue over two hours. His set was indicative of and influenced by the long career he’s had in electronic music, from the Detroit rave scene all the way to his contemporary collaboration with Kit Geary under the alias KGIV.

Klock’s phenomenal set was nothing short of the brand of techno that the Berghain resident has become so known for. The prolific artist has put out releases on Bpitch Control, Rekids, Klockworks, and Ostgut Ton. With about an hour left in the set, he mixed in his seminal track Subzero, marking his dissent into a very strong final hour that kept the venue packed until the lights came on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrototype brought the proper warehouse vibes and unbelievable energy all night.

The Roxy is quite a small venue for the power their\nmusic brings from the stage.

The album is constructed as a single song, though it is not as much a song so much as the totalization and exploration of the object, the machine itself. Matmos programs, sequences, beats and applies the washing machine to orchestrate the sonic capabilities of a single electronic appliance. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt times there’s the cavernous and ringing gong of metal, the percussive hits of clanking machinery, the glitch patterns from a soundboard, and even the sloshing of water in a rinse cycle heard in the mix. There is little tonal sweetness to be grasped from the album, with the exception of the occasional play with the electronics of the machine. This allows for the more immediate and percussive elements to dominate. Now and then the cacophony of metal fades gradually, drowning into a synth landscape, only to supplanted and swallowed again by the machine. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe album draws on the practice of musique concrète, the process of recording, sampling and manipulating raw sound material. Of course, this material is all from a single place, the Ultimate Care II. One of musique concrète’s pioneers, Pierre Schaeffer once said, “one might say that the origin of this music is also found in the interest in ‘plastifying’ music, of rendering it plastic like sculpture.” In this case, the sculptural form of the music is already assembled in the washing machine, and it is Matmos who are using their music to deconstruct the appliance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe allure of \u003ci\u003eUltimate Care II\u003c/i\u003e rests in the “machine-made-instrument” mystery. Because the sounds all have a source, the listener has the puzzle of trying to reconstruct the washing machine from its sonic remains. It’s a task not without reward. By the end, \u003ci\u003eUltimate Care II\u003c/i\u003e is working in full force, the album becoming a machine all its own.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Show Review // The Growlers @ The Observatory (02/15/16)",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eReview By\u003c/i\u003e: Sophia Forino, UCLA Radio DJ (02/28/16)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis Valentine’s Day weekend, the Growler’s returned to their home at The Observatory in Orange County (also home to their ever-growing festival Beach Goth) to deliver two sold-out shows during their “Smile Now Smile Later” winter tour. Having seen the Growlers about 10 times already, as many of their local Orange County fans have, I arrived at the show with relative expectations of a colorful and eclectic crowd, an undulating pit of tightly condensed teenagers, and a slightly sloppy, though always great, performance. Unsurprisingly, the show was filled to capacity with OC residents of the “underground”; pierced teens and young adults in patched and pinned denim jackets were densely dispersed throughout the loving couples composed of guys, gals, and the in-between. However, I was pleasantly surprised when the Growlers’ came on stage and gave a lengthy, tight, and seemingly sober performance. More on that later.\u0009\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eUpon walking into the venue, like with all Growlers shows, I did some exploring to see what fun stuff they had laid out for us fanguys and gals. After taking a pic with my boo in the yellow, hand-painted, wood cut-out heart advertising the tour (a marketing dream!) with, not to mention, set up photoshoot-style lighting (an Instagram model’s dream!), I ventured over to the Mexican corn and fruit-cup carts and didn’t buy anything because of its poor person unfriendly prices. Inside the Constellation Room (a room that holds smaller shows) I was confused to see several blow-up mattress-type loungers facing a half-assed held up white sheet showing a screening of the film “La Bamba”. However, upon cuddling up on one and catching the plane crash scene and, subsequent, death scene of Ritchie Valens and Buddy Holiday (so romantic, I know), I realized it was it was a pretty cool and unique idea to screen a movie and offer luxurious comfort for one’s horizontal body, especially at a concert. With the exploring and cuddling out of my system, I made my way towards the main stage, caught the end the opening act, Johnathan Richman (of the Modern Lovers) and Tommy Larkins, and awaited the Growlers. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike I said, this was a Growlers show unlike any I’ve ever seen. While the Growlers aren’t ones to play the same exact songs at every show, throughout the set they performed songs from the deep inner depths of their discography that I had never even expected to hear live such as, “The Moaning Man From Shanty Town”. They even whipped out an unexpected “beach gothy” cover of The Shirelles\u0026rsquo; “Mama Said” (Mama said whaat?). Of course they played the hits such as “Humdrum Blues,” “One Million Lovers,” and “Going Gets Tough”; it is easy to tell they are crowd favorites when suddenly your view is blocked by the endless screens of recording and snap-chatting cell phones (tsk tsk). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Beyond that, they truly sounded better than ever. Ever-present where the same silly stage antics — strange noises and tacky ironically-done crowd interactions — that make us love them, yet there was a noticeable absence of frequent lyric blunders and messed up time changes. Brooks Nielsen even hit the high note on “Wandering Eyes,” which I am sure made all the ladies and gentlemen swoon. Overall, it was definitely the best Growler’s show I have experienced and I give them mad credit since they are pretty much touring 24/7 and don\u0026rsquo;t even have time to surf the waves their songs are about (a California crime). Maybe it was because they were back at their home venue that made them sound so damn great. Maybe it was the saturated Valentine’s Day love in the air. Regardless, I left that show in such a swell mood that I wasn’t even fazed when I realized my car had been towed. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

I’ve always found their lineup to be eccentrically electronic with a couple of folky, spiritual bands to mix it up a little.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy relationship with music festivals have been relatively finicky but what I appreciate most about Lightning in a Bottle is its emphasis on a wholesome and environmentally friendly experience. A huge part of this festival is definitely its focus on getting in touch with your own spirituality and overall human goodness. This year, the festival is featuring all sorts of activities and performances besides music such as the Temple of Consciousness and The Learning Kitchen, places where you can enhance your own mental, emotional, and physical well being.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn extremely important part of Lightning in a Bottle is its focus on being environmentally conscious, their ethos. They’ve implemented a Green Report, which includes workshops on being more green and a speaking panel that’ll encourage attendees to live more sustainable lives. Lightening in a Bottle will also be using solar lights wherever possible and using more environmentally friendly lighting. Finally, the festival wants its attendees to not only feel inspired at the festival but to also inspire them to make a big difference in their own communities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis year’s lineup definitely features some huge acts such as Chet Faker, Grimes, Jamie Xx, Cashmere Cat, and Tokimonsta but there are definitely a couple of hidden gems in the lineup. I didn’t really find a pattern to the stages but for The Woogie stage, it’s a lot of house and EDM so if you’re into that, The Woogie stage is the place to be. Personally, I was really feeling the Lightning Stage and a couple of acts on the Thunder Stage. But all in all, the lineup looks pretty solid with some smaller acts that’ll definitely surprise you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe beauty of Lightning in a Bottle is the whole experience. I remember watching one of their promotional videos last year and you can feel the love and spiritual loving that flows throughout the festival. I love that this festival focuses on being environmentally conscious, promotes human balance and well-being, and even provides great music.

The Levitation group is partly responsible (along, of course, with\nSXSW) for making Austin one of the prescient music communities in the US. This year the\nfestival lives up to its ever-growing standards and providing fans with historic heavy-hitters and\nvigorous newcomers. That the festival has grown to its current size in less than a decade (the first\nfestival was 2008) mirrors the growth of Coachella. If you can make it to Austin for the\nweekend, then I urge you to go and celebrate the golden age of festivals at Levitation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re limited to buying one day and you want the most for your money, I suggest\ngoing on Friday. Slowdive and Brian Jonestown Massacre will attract huge crowds of\nshoegazers. Nicolas Jaar is known for amazing performances. Also watch out for Mild High Club\nand Twin Peaks. However, if you know what’s good for you, then go see Brian Wilson perform\n“Pet Sounds” on Saturday! (It recalls Roger Waters performing “Dark Side” at Coachella 2008\nwho booked by Coachella before they reached a ten-year-tenure.) Personally, the Sunday line-up\nis a little more stale to me. Magic Wands’s goth pop will be groovy and Quraishi’s mesmerizing\nrubab playing is an essential for any self-proclaimed hippie or cosmopolitan. Needless to say,\nWeen is a big deal for a lot of people and if you’re one of them you will want to be there.\n\u003c/p\u003e",

Aaron Maine cites electronic and pop music as newer influences towards the making of “Pool” and it definitely shows. While this marks a significant change in sound in comparison to Aaron’s discography before “Pool”, it certainly is a wonderfully crafted addition to the mix that complements Aaron’s previous works very well. “Pool” expresses optimism and melancholia both to a great length - anyone can choose to dance to or simply ponder alone on the drive home and still be satisfied with their listening experience.

I get roughly 80+ submissions a day, from PR agencies to labels to managers to bands themselves. Second, I am a radio DJ. I showcase some of the best music that exists and with that, how music impacts my life so much. My show this quarter \u003ci\u003ePillow Talk\u003c/i\u003e is centered around music that have very specific meanings to me and the people in my life. Third, I simply love music. I love finding bands and musicians that don’t get mainstream attention and hope that my roles as a blogger and DJ can help them find the attention and love they deserve. It is magical how a song and band can mean so much to a person.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, my interactions with other personnel is strictly web-based and I have few interactions with other people face to face. But I am still aware of the harassment and potential job threats that come with the music industry. I was especially livid when I read the part about Cascine’s project manager, Andi Wilson, getting harassed at SXSW because I’ve corresponded emails with her before. It was rather unbelievable that she was just trying to do her job and had to deal with sexual harassment at the same time. And when she said, “You can’t name names. Your reputation gets tarnished,” it really struck a core with me: why do women have to prove their capability in the industry? Men can go around and sexually harass women until an actual army of women stand up and confirm these assaults. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s no question that having connections in the music industry is vital to survive — it’s just part of the job. So when men flaunt their connections in order to receive sexual favors from women, what are we suppose to do? Our careers depend on these connections but we have to forego our bodies and our own peace of mind in order to do something that we love so much. As Haithcoat states, “men in the industry often dangle their connections and power as sexual carrots, with the implicit understanding they\u0026rsquo;ll be yanked away if you refuse their advances.” Women are being silenced and threatened by men of power who know far too well that they are putting us in such a difficult position to be in. And yet, people still blame women for being complacent, still blaming women when they are the victims. At point can we blame men? Never? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs much as I love music, I cannot see myself working in an industry where complacency is necessary to even have and keep a career. In my own experience, after a publicist and I became friends on Facebook, he has persistently asked me out for coffee to the point that I gave in at one point and said yes. But my mind started reeling: I barely knew who he was and yet he kept asking to meet me. I asked a male friend of mine to come with me to the meeting because I was just that paranoid. In the end, I cancelled because I just couldn’t go through with it. While my story is minimal, it still puts me on the edge as to how shady the industry can be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat is infuriating is that men think that this is their industry and that women are there to be slabs of meat that are there for men’s own sexual pleasure. This, then, makes women question their own capabilities. What are we suppose to think when we only got our jobs because someone with power thinks that we’re cute, that we’re there just to give them an extra ounce of pleasure in their lives. Why should my career be built upon someone’s unsolicited crush on me? Women are constantly trying to do their job and battle off men and sexual assaults and the real question is why this is the norm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSexual harassment in the industry is covered up when the women are working behind the scenes. Publicist Heathcliff Berru had been sexually harassing women for years but only recently, he was called out for his gross misconduct. Dirty Projectors’ Amber Coffman tweeted about how Berru had grabbed her ass and bit her hair after minutes of meeting her. After that, Best Coast’s front woman Bethany Cosentino also spoke out about Berru sexually harassing her. These sexual harassment stories are only brought to light when well known women, who have a face and voice in the industry, speak out about the outrageous mistreatment of women. Once again, it takes a literal army of women to just take one disgusting sexual predator down. Why is it that one man’s words are worth more than one woman’s words?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs UCLA celebrates Female Empowerment week, I challenge you to question the sexualization of women in the industry. The media specifically focuses on the aesthetic appeal of female artists rather than their actual talent. The industry capitalizes on society’s apparently inherent need to degrade women to just their looks. It’s so much worse when women don’t have a face or voice to fight back, and the final result is how silenced and trapped we feel.\u003c/p\u003e",

The last time I listened to this band was when their second album \u003ci\u003eThe Orchard\u003c/i\u003e came out and that was in 2010 when indie pop fervently scaled the music industry with the likes of Vampire Weekend and Two Door Cinema Club. When the band released the first single “Water” from \u003ci\u003eNeed Your Light\u003c/i\u003e, I felt like they had evolved in their sound: it sounded more synthesized and more electropop-y. I completely skipped over \u003ci\u003eBeta Love\u003c/i\u003e because it was so heavily drowned in electronica. With \u003ci\u003eNeed Your Light\u003c/i\u003e, Ra Ra Riot brings back bit of the indie pop rock that I loved in \u003ci\u003eThe Orchard\u003c/i\u003e and even a bit of the orchestral sound in their first album \u003ci\u003eThe Rhumb Line\u003c/i\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut when I hear \u003ci\u003eNeed Your Light\u003c/i\u003e, I feel a little…stuck in all its pop sounds. At some points, I even feel like I’m listening to a Carly Rae Jepsen album when I’m looking for more of their indie pop rock sound. Songs like “Absolutely” and “Foreign Lovers” just have such a standard formula for happy go-lucky songs that seemingly sounds great to any one but no actually distinguishable qualities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, there are some serious gems on this album like “Instant Breakup”. It could be that I just really like sad songs…but the electropop on this track has this fantastic quality of keeping the track lighter in the beginning and when it hits the chorus, it morphs into this dark entity that really gets at the heart of what the track is about. I also love the mix of pop with the orchestral strings, adding so much more depth and contrast into the track. Another one of my favorites is “Suckers” which has a much darker electropop sound compared to the rest of the album. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, I think \u003ci\u003eNeed Your Light\u003c/i\u003e was almost a redemption album. Ra Ra Riot definitely returned back to their roots and what I do like about this album is that it is definitely experimenting with the balance between electronica and actual instrumentation. This era of music rides so much on experimental music and Ra Ra Riot is experimenting with releasing a hybrid sound.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFavorite Tracks:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWater (feat.

Three years since they played probably the best show a band has ever bowed out to. Three years since I wondered if my parents would be ok with me spending all my teenage savings flying out and somehow finding tickets to said show. Three years since I instead stayed up all night at home, alternately crying and wanting to jump for joy to the online live stream. Because, let’s face it, LCD Soundsystem were the greatest band ever for the short amount of time they existed. It’d be a waste of online space to even begin getting into the specifics of this. Though we were all happy that Murphy had the wisdom to leave his greatest ever party a little early (he’s producing, making his own coffee beans, writing, and DJing a lot now, and he seems really happy), April the 2nd, 2011, was a pretty sad day for a lot of people, marking the end of one of the most emotionally resonant, funky, loud, funny, cool bands we’ve ever known.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Long Goodbye \u003c/em\u003ecollects the entire three-hour show that James Murphy and all his friends played not long after dropping their last album, \u003cem\u003eThis Is Happening\u003c/em\u003e. Murphy was forty years old when he decided to put LCD on hold — he admitted to being a “spectacular failure” until informally starting the project in 2001 with “\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOH1vhgdqYQ\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLosing My Edge\u003c/a\u003e\u0026ldquo; — and wisely wanting to quit while he was ahead, he put on a fairly spectacular series of shows at New York’s Terminal 5 and Madison Square Garden, aided by nearly every musician he’d ever worked with, Arcade Fire, Reggie Watts and a \u003cem\u003eload \u003c/em\u003eof other wonderful people. I’ve never seen a show where a group of people played any more lovingly than this, nor an audience as gratefully ecstatic. You can see all the results in the equally wonderful documentary “\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0-s1XkvWzM\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eShut Up And Play The Hits\u003c/a\u003e”, and listen to them here. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA five-LP set clocking in at over 187 minutes, it’s a big deal, but a big deal totally worth your time. There’s everything here, from the pyrotechnics of “Dance Yrself Clean,” “All My Friends”, to a perfect rendition of the whole of “45:33,” Harry Nilsson covers, and the heartbreaking closer “New York, I Love You, But You’re Bringing Me Down” (which will probably make you cry). Everything in between is pyrotechnically spectacular, and a worthy memory of the last show of [one of] the greatest band[s] ever.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGRADE: \u003c/strong\u003e9/10\u003c/p\u003e",

While her style may not innovate or deviate extremely strongly from what previous artists have done, her vocal execution and the simplicity of the backing instruments create an atmosphere that is wholly soothing and enjoyable to listen to on its own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe album begins with the slow-paced and nostalgic \u0026ldquo;Honeymoon.\u0026rdquo; As an introductory track, it lays the groundwork and tone for the rest of the album. While the songs themselves may differ in terms of style, the overall instrumentation (Foy singing over sparse beats) and general framework does not. With this, Lyla Foy is able to venture into new genres ranging from the electronic with \u0026ldquo;Feather Tongue\u0026rdquo; to the more country influenced with \u0026ldquo;Rumour.\u0026rdquo; These stylistic changes all provide minor, but welcome, changes of pace to the album that allow for greater depth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, the consistent choice in a somber tone also means that the strength of most of the songs comes out of Foy’s singing ability and vocal melodies. Fortunately, Foy proves herself to be an extremely capable singer and her whispering, almost longing, vocals are the highlight of the album. The only problem with this is that some of her vocal work reach such highs that some of the more subdued sections of the album can feel like it drags at times. Combined with the slower tone of most of her songs, this can be an annoyance, especially towards the end of the album where the listener has been listening to the album for nearly 30 minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIndividually, each song is strong and has merits on its own. But as an album, the monotony of the songs can take its toll. Putting the instrumentation on the forefront more often would definitely help, but despite this, the album is still definitely worth listening to and has plenty of emotional melodies and strong vocal work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecommended Tracks: Honeymoon, Impossible, Feather Tongue\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGRADE:\u003c/strong\u003e 8/10\u003c/p\u003e",

Frusciante not only created every sound heard on the album, but he also produced it as well as created the cover art. This album takes a step far away from his previous solo albums, adding all the elements he once kept separate together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe opens with falsetto and synth, pushing the listener to the border between pleasure and discomfort. The first track harshly transitions into the second (as do most of the transitions on the album), “Sleep,” filled with overlaps of his voice in falsetto and lowered pitch. The song starts off slowly but then suddenly quickens the pace, going back and forth between the two throughout the song. Like most Frusciante songs, the lyrics are a jumble of poeticism that have to be read and reread, listened to and re-listened to multiple times to even grasp slightly what he was attempting to say. Yet, somehow the combination of words he uses works well to create a beautiful song.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the album continues, it hits its high point with the fifth track, “Fanfare.” Frusciante takes us back in time to 80’s synth pop with the still complex yet meaningful love-story lyrics. The song transitions smoothly into the voiceless song “Cinch,” which consists of distorted guitar arpeggios and drum beats that are often paired together unorthodoxly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEnclosure,\u003c/em\u003e like most of Frusciante’s other solo albums, is a beautifully chaotic mess, with lyrics that can make your mind go crazy from trying to figure out what he is trying to say. Ultimately, the focus of this album is on the music rather than lyrics and vocals. Yet, amongst the mess, he managed to create a beautiful art piece that pushes his own limits of creativity, closely approaching the line of insanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecommended Tracks: Sleep, Fanfare\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGRADE:\u003c/strong\u003e 8/10\u003c/p\u003e",

With bands like Unknown Mortal Orchestra, Diiv, Night Beats, and Blonde Redhead, this festival was not one to miss!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e The cloudy and dusty day in Mecca started off with a bang, and despite the long line of late campers and anxious festival-goers, everyone was pumped and excited to get started. The long line of cars was alleviated with free energy drinks, and everyone was friendly and clearly stoked.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eAfter passing through security, people were eager to get to the stages.  Bands  Church of Son and LA Witch opened the show on the party stage, while Froth got the crowd going the Moon Stage with their psychedelic lo-fi set. Next came bands like Mr. Elevator along with Fever the Ghost and Night Beats. The local LA dudes from Mystic Braves then played a great set, and the sun set to the sounds of Unknown Mortal Orchestra.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e Between sets festival goers could catch a bite at one of the many food trucks there, and relax by the lake. On-site shops offered festival goers small trinkets for sale, and you could grab a tie-dyed dessert daze shirt at the merch table. The VIP section was super chill and included hammocks and tee pees where you could catch a drink and relax in between sets. \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003eEven with all those amenities, it’s easy to get tired at an all-day festival in the desert. However, even late into the night, the slightly drunk, dusty, and happy crowd’s energy was not lost, even with Liars playing a set until 2am. After the set, desert dazers could become desert dwellers and stroll back to their snuggly campsites. Needless to say, happy festival goers probably needed all of Sunday to recuperate. Until next year, desert daze!\u003c/div\u003e",

Chad VanGaalen delivers us his new LP \u003cem\u003eShrink Dust \u003c/em\u003ewhich is made up of twelve different and unique tracks. The intriguing illustration on the LP cover was created by Mr. VanGaalen himself, which is rare to hear nowadays. The artistic ability shown on the cover already sets him apart from other artists attempting to make it in the music industry. Along with his graphic art, his ability to produce genuine music is evidently portrayed when listening to all twelve tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen first listening to this album, I thought some of the songs could have been selected to be featured in \u003cem\u003eGarden State\u003c/em\u003e, an indie film written and directed by Zach Braff. This is a compliment considering that \u003cem\u003eGarden State\u003c/em\u003e’s soundtrack consists of impeccable artists like Coldplay, The Shins, Simon \u0026amp; Garfunkel, Frou Frou, Iron \u0026amp; Wine and many more other artists. Speaking of The Shins, a listener can definitely hear an influence of the band on \u003cem\u003eShrink Dust\u003c/em\u003e. The album may sound a little depressing to some but once you meticulously hear the details of the album, you can most likely appreciate the diversity of sounds such as hints of psychedelia, folk tunes, and intensely deep lyrics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first single from \u003cem\u003eShrink Dust\u003c/em\u003e is “Where Are You?” which has a steady, walking-tempo beat associated with a somewhat distant voice. My favorite track from this LP is “Lila” because of its potential to be played in an awesome film about someone’s struggle to become a better person and he or she is attempting to get someone. Somewhat of a cliché movie but it would have to be authentic in order for this song to be featured in the film because this whole LP is filled with authenticity, true feelings, and creativity. The song “Lila\u0026quot; has faint whistling throughout the song with repetitive singing “Lila’s” and it just grabs your heart. I would recommend this album for those who enjoy film compilation music and road trip songs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecommended Tracks: Frozen Paradise, Lila, Where Are You\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGRADE: \u003c/strong\u003e7.5/10\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"http://cdn.antiquiet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/beck-morning-phase.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eBy: Joe Ackerman\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eIt’s been nearly six years since Beck Hansen last put out an album, but it’s not like he hasn’t done anything since. There’s been a whole album written just in sheet music, time putting in producing work for Charlotte Gainsbourg, Stephen Malkmus and Thurston Moore, collaborations with Philip Glass and Jack White, and most importantly, three (two of them 15 minutes long) singles from last year that sounded as interesting as anything he’d done before. For someone who grew up in the poorer parts of Los Angeles and made a living working at video rental stores and singing Mississippi John Hurt songs on crowded LA Metro buses (just try and listen to his first few albums, released everywhere from random cassette tapes to K Records, and ranging from the insane and unlistenable to the totally brilliant), it’s pretty incredible how far Beck has come - from those first tapes to the insane and MTV-friendly noise of \u003cem\u003eOdelay\u003c/em\u003e, to the surprisingly emotional \u003cem\u003eSea Change.\u003c/em\u003e That someone so utterly crazy and brilliant, in no way suited for this world, can be something like an outsider national treasure, is quite amazing. The problem with \u003cem\u003eMorning Phase\u003c/em\u003e, out now on Capitol Records, is that it’s safe and predictable in a way those songs absolutely weren’t, and sounds like Beck retreading old territory. \u003cem\u003eMorning Phase \u003c/em\u003eis, by Beck’s own admission, \u003cem\u003eSea Change Part II.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eMorning Phase \u003c/em\u003eisn’t a bad album by any means. It’s permeated by string arrangements conducted by Beck’s father, David Campbell, which make you think about Serge Gainsbourg, and the most beautiful parts of \u003cem\u003eSea Change, \u003c/em\u003eand production that puts the music somewhere into the ethereal. It’s full of Beck’s voice, which seems to get more angelic every year. This is all good. But there’s also the problem that from the start of the album - from the slowly strummed chords and bells that come in a few seconds into “Morning,” Beck’s ghostly vocals and harmonies, impressionistic lyrics, and its feeling of utter, irreversible heartbreak - it all sounds almost exactly like the same heartbreak he told us about twelve years ago. The whole thing is something that sounds like an artist who’s perfected his form, but sadly got a little boring. That isn’t good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eOn the good side, songs like “Morning,” and the single, “Blue Moon,” have all of the sadness and tenderness of \u003cem\u003eSea Change, \u003c/em\u003eand the album moves as a kind of cathartic whole, the opposite of the paranoid manic ironic hyperactive funk of Beck’s albums in the 90s. \u003cem\u003eMorning Phase \u003c/em\u003eshows Beck as a really, really talented artist who’s probably one of the greatest songwriters in the world today. The problem is that when all that’s said, the album doesn’t really do any of the things that put Beck there in the first place: it isn’t surprising, or funny, or even that weird. Even after multiple listens, the tracks seem to fade into one another; maybe that’s part of the album’s lonely, rejected unity, or maybe it’s just the sound of someone who needs to start having fun making music again. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eListen to \u003cem\u003eMorning Phase \u003c/em\u003ea few times, because it truly is a stirring, emotional experience. But once you’ve done that, listen to “I Won’t Be Long” and “Unfriended” from last year, and you’ll know you’re listening to the real Beck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003eRecommended tracks: Morning, Blue Moon, Unforgiven\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p2\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGRADE: \u003c/strong\u003e6/10\u003c/p\u003e",

It seems an apt analogy for the album itself - the songs are a tangled mess, but colorful enough to encourage a second listen. Liars fumble around on the tracks, mixing punk with loops and electronic beats. \u003cem\u003eMess \u003c/em\u003emakes a fine addition to dance-punk, but not without hiccups. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e Harkening back to The Revolting Cocks’ precedent, the album successfully mixes ominous vocals (see “Mask Maker”) and synths. Slower tracks, like “I’m No Gold” are minimalist, something that spans the entire album. They enter Fuck Buttons territory often, though not with great élan. As a band famous for morphing through genres throughout their discography, the product can often be challenging to traditional expectations. \u003cem\u003eMess \u003c/em\u003eis no different. Without the full frontal anger blasting from some previous albums (\u003cem\u003eLiars, They Were Wrong So We Drowned)\u003c/em\u003e, something else more articulate comes out here, though muddled by a confused artistic narrative. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e Wresting with that confusion is becoming, though, in listening to the album: each new song is another exploration on the same subject, and in doing so, \u003cem\u003eMess \u003c/em\u003ebecomes aesthetically cohesive without being boring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e Watching the official video for “Mess on a Mission,” one gets the sense that the Liars are using their music as a platform to show what a mess everything is. They cross through the ruins of an urban apocalypse, a Mayan temple, a castle, some patrician event, rob a bank, and finally get on stage with varying weapons. Angus’ pleasantly grating vocals are expected, but the whole point of \u003cem\u003eMess \u003c/em\u003eis that it’s within a different context, framed to diluted beats.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003eRecommended tracks: Mess on a Mission, Mask Maker, Vox Tunded D.E.D., Pro Anti Anti\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGRADE: \u003c/strong\u003e7.5/10\u003c/p\u003e",

Honestly, the album sounds like even they’re a little bit taken aback that they’re still doing this. It’s funny, when I first heard that they made a new album, I had gotten them confused with The Incredible String Band, one of the bands who played Woodstock. These guys aren’t the most relevant people in the world, having peaked in that weird mid-90s nostalgia movement that saw their particular brand of Blues Traveller meets Phish neo-hippieisms chart alongside the swing revival and third-wave ska bands. But if you’re jonesing for some crusty old psych jams and for some reason feel like \u003cem\u003eEurope ’72\u003c/em\u003e has worn its welcome, and for some even stranger reason you don’t want to put one of their older albums on, I mean, it’s not like \u003cem\u003eSongs In My Head\u003c/em\u003e is… there, I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the songs here are passably enjoyable feel-good flower-power jams. “Colorado Bluebird Sky,” a laid-back bluegrass track, starts things off pretty strong, evoking the feeling of a sunny afternoon sitting on the porch and just soaking it all in. “So Far From Home” is another vaguely bluegrass type song, though remarkably more contrived-sounding, and letting a very strong stench of Jimmy Buffett seep into the mix. The rest of the album, however, is pretty much saturated with this old-dad-in-Birkenstocks-dancing-awkwardly giddiness and it makes it hard for anyone that isn’t a dedicated String Cheese fan to stomach the whole album. “Let’s Go Outside,” which bewilderingly has a kind of Lenny Kravitz/Red Hot Chili Peppers vibe to it, is so misguided and terrible, no one should ever listen to it. The vibe spills over into the tracks preceding it and following it, and then makes a return on the disco-tinged “Rosie.” Honestly this would be understandable if the Incident had first come out in 1972, but their first album came out in goddamn \u003cem\u003e1993\u003c/em\u003e. Kim Gordon is older than any of the band members.  Even stranger, the Incident is generally known for alt-country, not this weird old-white-guy funk they’re trying to pull off. It would be fine if they went for that the whole way through, but with the exception of “Colorado Bluebird Sky” and the artificially sappy “Struggling Angel,” that influence is barely present.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI don’t want to meet the person who says that they really enjoyed this album. Not because I look down on them for their taste in music, but because I can only imagine that they’d be so unbearably earnest and bursting with optimism that I’m not entirely positive my innate cynicism could survive the encounter. And I kinda need that if I want to continue being a music critic. \u003cem\u003eSongs In My Head\u003c/em\u003e, however, will likely be nobody’s favorite anything. More than likely, it’s just an excuse for the band to tour again, and if I know my hippie jam bands, any excuse to do that will be jumped at without a second thought. And it’s clear that a second thought was never cast upon any of these songs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecommended Tracks: Colorado Bluebird Sky, Betray The Dark, Struggling Angel\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGRADE\u003c/strong\u003e: 5.6/10\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"http://i57.tinypic.com/2i1ggoy.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirst time I heard “Take Me Out” was on a compilation album that a local CD seller gave me as a purchase gift, along with three other albums I bought from him, “Take Them On, On Your Own” by BRMC, “Room On Fire” by the Strokes, and “Up the Bracket” by the Libertines. And Franz Ferdinand’s recent tour stop at the Wiltern marks my sixth time of seeing them live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile post punk revival and garage rock scene may already be viewed as pre-2010 nostalgia acts, Franz Ferdinand in their latest album “Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action” has made a firm statement of their determination to revisit that path. The two-hour performance at the iconic Wiltern mingled older hits that were warmly responded by the audience, with some of my favorites off the new album, “Evil Eye”, “Love Illumination”. Franz Ferdinand’s live shows have always been vigorously invasive and energy-fused, and tonight it was no exception. Alex Kapranos kept dropping the Los Angeles name and he was obviously satisfied by the thunderous cheers and applauds from beneath the stage. When it came the unsettling intro of “Take Me Out”, it seemed that not a single person in the venue could keep their feet on the ground. The quirky guitar riffs and super danceable bass lines have already become the Scotland outfit’s most identifiable trademarks. For tracks off their more electrified album “Tonight: Franz Ferdinand”, the sexy beats seemingly synchronized with the pulses, alerting the audience of the upcoming danger. The main set, as always, ended with an amazing drum outro by all four member’s joint efforts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eKapranos shortly returned to the stage for a solo intro of “Jacqueline” before joined by his bandmates again. The 2004 hit was allegedly about the Glaswegian poet Ivor Cutler and his affection for the 17-year-old Jacqueline, but it also featured a sense of hopeless hedonism with the lines “it’s always better on holiday/ so much better on holiday/ that’s why we only work then/ we need the money”. Highlight of the night was definitely when they brought out the opener Cate Le Bon for an astonishing rendition of “Call Me” by the new wave pioneers, Blondie. Apparently Debbie Harry handpicked Franz Ferdinand to do a cover of this track for the 2009 war child charity album, and they debuted the live version at that year’s NME Awards with La Roux collaborating on vocals. The song “This Fire” probably has their most candidly revolting lyrics, “this fire is out of control/ we gotta burn this city/ burn this city”. I guess it’s hard to ignore the political nuance when their name was taken from a figure so closely tied to the world war. Is the insurrection coming? When the audience were still chanting the “This Fire” slogan, pretty ironically, Franz Ferdinand then played “Goodbye Lovers \u0026amp; Friends” and called it a night. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWritten by Mengqiao\u003c/p\u003e",

Following in the footsteps of melancholy musicians in miserable places - The Smiths, for example - Protomarty successfully translates Detroit into an album. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e The songs are grungy, angry in the way that people who have been angry forever are, and garage-y without devolving to cliché. It’s taut and controlled post-punk that dabbles in reverb. Before the barrage of bass and guitars becomes overwhelming, they get reeled in to reveal surprisingly excellent lyrics: Joe Casey’s moans about shitty people, a shitty city with a shitty mayor, and shitty days are rousing and insightful. In fact, the album is rife with cultural references (not the Girls kind, the literature/arts kind): barfly dads die under Casey’s vengeful, unromantic pen; \u003cem\u003eHangover Square \u003c/em\u003einspired “Maidenhead,” the first song on the album — setting a good precedent. “Shit goes up, shit goes down,” the song starts, aptly describing the tempo of the album. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e While previous Protomartyr discography is straight punk, \u003cem\u003eUnder Color of Official Right \u003c/em\u003eis more mature, thoughtfully exploring minimalist punk roots. Instead of falling into the trap of sophomoric rock, Protomartyr rises from their punk roots into something more elevated, more adult in expressing antipathy. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"p1\"\u003e Some songs are less enthusiastic about “dead moods” while others are enthusiastically hateful. Lethargic vocals top perfectly lo-fi post punk - imagine a drunk (on mid-shelf whiskey), contemplative re-exploration of their \u003cem\u003eNo Passion All Technique\u003c/em\u003e.

Yes, that’s forty-five albums (look here: \u003ca href=\"http://ingridsuperstar.bandcamp.com/music\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://ingridsuperstar.bandcamp.com/music\u003c/a\u003e). Fresh out of a creative New York family of artists and actors, Frankie Cosmos makes homemade music that’s washed in sorrow and modern-day confusion, hope and determination to make things make sense. Equal parts K Records and Moldy Peaches, \u003cem\u003eZentropy\u003c/em\u003e - recorded with Kline’s boyfriend Aaron Maine (AKA Ronnie Mystery) - comes just after the death of her beloved dog, Joe Joe.

Recorded in Manhattan’s Business District, it’s also a departure from the 4-track cassette tape sound of her previous (nearly) fifty albums, with the sort of production that’s listenable and exciting without being too clean or grandiose.

The first opener, Marriages, is a shoegaze act signed to Sargent House, a label usually known for hosting math rock bands. The second opener, Earth, is a veteran band best known for their pioneering work in drone doom, but has recently transitioned to a sound influenced by country, rock, and jazz. The headliner, Deafheaven, is a band hailing from San Francisco whose sound defies easy classification. They incorporate an interesting mix of shoegaze, black metal, and post rock, especially in their latest album, Sunbather, which received numerous accolades in the year-end lists of 2013. When you put all three of these bands in the same venue, the results are interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eMarriages opened with “Ride In My Place,” the first song off of their latest EP, Kitsune. While it was clear that the majority of the crowd was at the show for either Earth or Deafheaven, Marriages held their own. Their performance was solid, and their atmospheric, hazy music had the crowd entranced. As following with the tenets of shoegaze, their sound was characterized by significant distortion, a common element between all the acts that night.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNext up was Earth, who in any other context would likely have been headlining the show. Though their set was over 45 minutes long, they only played a few songs, which should not surprise an avid Earth listener. They opened with some new material, the sound of which surprised me since I was used to their drone material off of Earth 2. Instead of heavily distorted, sludgy riffs, I was met with a variety of bright, major chord riffs through a guitar that had made use of a phaser effect. While their newer sound is a significant departure, it was still quite compelling, and the crowd was thoroughly enjoying their performance. For their last song, they played the first song frontman Dylan Carson had written for the band. While it was of their earlier sound musically, the Carson still utilized the same guitar setup which resulted in an interesting hybrid of their new and old sound.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, Deafheaven came on. Admittedly, this was the band I was most excited to see. The last time I had seen them, they were opening for Boris shortly after the release of Sunbather. The rest of the crowd was palpably excited as well. They opened with “Dream House,” the first song off of Sunbather. After that, they proceeding to play the entire rest of the album. It was an experience that can only be described as surreal. Deafheaven displayed a clear mastery of their material, allowing them to adapt Sunbather into an almost entirely different experience than the recorded album. Some of the slower, plodding parts were cut short in order to deliver a supremely paced musical experience. Though they had some technical difficulties about halfway into their set, they quickly recovered and never lost energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe crowd was surprisingly energetic, with a sizable mosh pit forming almost immediately. Though it had not even been a year since I last saw them, it was clear that Deafheaven had significantly improved their live performance. Frontman George Clarke exhibited an immense stage presence, while also forming an intimate connection with the audience. Their entire set proved to be unlike any other show I had been to. At the end of “Pecan Tree,” just when I thought it was over, they returned on stage for an encore of a song from their earlier album, Roads to Judah. After that concluded, I was left in awe, pondering how it was possible for a group to transform an album so much from its recorded iteration to a live performance.\u003c/p\u003e",

His bluesy, raspy voice appears untouched so that the flaws and manipulations he places within certain songs are clearly evident. In some songs, such as the last track “Dead Weight,” a female voice is added into the background to balance out his harshness with a smoother voice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe album begins with only Jack Berry’s voice describing his mind that will not stay still. When his voice cuts out, hard guitar melodies come into play, starting the album with an intense hard rock sound. It continues on with hard blues rock until the seventh track, “Substitute,” which constitutes roughly the middle of the album, where is slows down to a more mellowed blues song.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMore than just blues is incorporated into \u003cem\u003eHeathen Heart\u003c/em\u003e, however. About two thirds of the way through the second track, “Two Steps,” there is a guitar solo featured with psychedelic elements, adding a slight variation from the rest of the album. Following the deviation, he jumps directly back into blues rock in the catchy song, “Kiss Like.” Here the similarity to The Black Keys is evident, with changes in voice projection level. The song itself is a rollercoaster, going from just his voice with a light guitar in the back to him shouting and a full band in play.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough it is evident that Berry has not yet reached the level of The Black Keys or Jack White, he successfully encompasses all the characteristics of blues rock ‘n roll, and even throws some soul into the mix.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRecommended Tracks: Two Steps, Kiss Like\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGRADE: \u003c/strong\u003e7/10\u003c/p\u003e",

He has toured internationally as a member of Wilco. He has shown his undeniable prowess as a jazz guitarist and his intuitive musicality and versatility as a collaborator with everyone from Deborah Holland to Mike Watt. And yet, in the back of his mind through all of those projects, there was the constant lingering idea of an album that would combine sensual soundscapes with the classical romance of the Great American Songbook. It was an ambitious idea that Cline doubted would ever come to fruition, but nevertheless he had already come up with a name for it: Lovers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor all the venues that Cline has performed in, he was the first to acknowledge the poignance that UCLA’s Royce Hall held for him. Being a Los Angeles native and the son of UCLA alumni, Cline had set foot in Royce many times throughout his life. Never had he thought that he could draw a crowd there, especially with his own music and for what he referred to as “a Saturday night of almost nothing but ballads”. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe night was opened by Big Lazy, a three-piece rock outfit whose blend of grit and cinematic instrumentals was a seamless introduction into the grander epic that was to follow. While the idea for Lovers first came about in the ‘80s, it was clear as the performance unfolded that this was the culmination of decades of collaboration and absorption of music from all generations and corners of the emotional spectrum. In addition to featuring original material, the group also performed material as varied from the Rodgers/Hammerstein classic “I Have Dreamed” to a stunning reimagining of Sonic Youth’s “Snare, Girl”, each song adding another layer to the music’s statement of affection for humanity itself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver half of the group onstage had also been involved in the recording of Lovers, including Cline’s wife Yuka C Honda on keyboard and synthesizer as well as his twin brother Alex Cline on drums. Notably absent from the stage was Julian Lage, who contributed acoustic and electric guitar to the album. Lage had been touring with the group but due to unexpected weather conditions he was forced to miss the performance, replaced instead by Los Angeles-based guitarist Ethan Sherman. Another key player onstage was Michael Leonhart, who served as conductor throughout the night as well as performing on trumpet and flugelhorn. It was off the stage, however, that Leonhart may have made his largest contribution to the project. As Lovers was coming together, Leonhart was Cline’s frequent collaborator who was critical in arranging and orchestrating the pieces to fit the scope that Cline had envisioned for it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"719\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2f45ef2a88106f6b6495d930eb34ec71/tumblr_inline_oojfn9M7Az1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"719\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen surveying the nineteen musicians who had gathered on the stage, the setting was impressive both in its breadth and its variety. The standard string and brass instrumentation was compounded by a timbrally expansive woodwind section as well as a harp, synthesizer, drums, vibraphone, and of course electric guitars. While a less-knowledgeable observer could have mistaken the elaborate selection of effects pedals at Cline’s feet as being contradictory to a night of intimacy and romance, anyone who is familiar with Cline’s work is well-aware of the innovative and tasteful way he uses pedals to enhance a musical experience without ever overshadowing the grander narrative. While Lovers may have spent decades germinating within the confines of Cline’s own imagination and ambitions, the final product and performance were clearly larger than any one man or one story. The result was a stunning display of tenderness and passion set to an ensemble that even upon the first listen already felt both timeless and revolutionary all at once. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"853\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/eb8e9321d0814fba6566fffd89688736/tumblr_inline_oojfnl3rsw1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"853\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By: Garrett Laird\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date: 4/11/17\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to stem cell treatment, people want immediate therapies; they want a chance. The promise of stem-cells is a tantalizing one. With it could come solutions to major diseases such as cancer and birth defects, both of which can be caused by defunct cell differentiation and division. But with such potential, many worry about the viability of this strategy and the bioethical implications of introducing these cells into patients. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday, there is a rise in unregulated stem cell clinics. Most are for-profit and they don’t always play by the rules. \u003ci\u003eThe New England Journal of Medicine \u003c/i\u003erecently published case studies I researched\u003ca href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/15/520118310/3-women-blinded-by-unproven-stem-cell-treatments\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e on NPR\u003c/a\u003e about three women blinded by treatment for macular degeneration from a clinic in Florida. With the hopes of restored vision, these women underwent hugely unregulated stem cell injection. It’s on the FDA to facilitate these practices and crack down on those who are putting patients at an unnecessary risk. With the visibility of these cases, it is surprising that they are still sitting this one out. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother case of macular degeneration therapy in Japan reported more promising results. No further deterioration in the patient’s vision was observed after treatment. The difference here is that Japanese researchers used induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells in a carefully designed study. In Florida, however, adult stem cells from fat tissue of the patients were injected. After stem cells age, they become more and more specific to cell types. IPS cells, however, can differentiate into any tissue in the body. Therefore, this makes them an excellent candidate for treatment. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGreat controversy lies in the use of human embryonic stem cells. Their extraction results in the death of the embryo. As such, the issue lies in the viability of the living organism as becoming a full grown human. The potency of this particular study, however, is that these are iPS cells which come from any cell in the body and can be coaxed into having embryonic stem cell-like differentiation potential. While the research community is making great strides in side-stepping the embryonic stem cell issue, their understanding and facilitation of this therapy is hugely underdeveloped. This is why patients are not receiving these injections more frequently. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\nTo be sure, iPS cells are still new in development and application. Genetic factors associated with the converted cells still present a great level of uncertainty. Yet what this situation offers is a wide ranging social, medical, and economic study of how new technologies and treatments present important and new challenges. Health regulators keep a keen eye on clinical trials and medical developments, yet rising numbers of stem cell clinics are able to evade regulation. This is generally because guidelines and rules concerning these treatments are not yet in place. And thus, people are willing to undergo treatment under assuming pretenses, whether this be in the United States or in other countries. The danger here lies in the quality and safety of care.\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Carner originally garnered attention among certain circles for the feature of his track “Florence” in an iPhone commercial and his connections to fellow UK artists Archy Marshall (aka King Krule) and Rejjie Snow, but it is with this album that Carner establishes himself as a powerful up and coming force in the UK rap scene.\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor starters, what makes a rap album a good rap album? Is it a particularly infectious beat produced by a DJ with a name reminiscent of my personal favorite backyard condiment, a 16 bar count hard enough to drop, or spitting about coming from the bottom and finding yourself on top? While all those can, and certainly are, elements of a number of great rap albums, Carner employs a different tactic. Instead of speaking through elements of grandeur, the main thematic elements utilized are innately personal - from his loving relationship with his mother and his tumultuous relationship with his father, to simply messing around with friends, and the loneliness that comes from wishing for someone who is no longer around. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGSkqM5Cd8zw\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GSkqM5Cd8zw?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe subject matter is at its heart fundamentally sentimental and the instrumentation throughout reflects this. Instead of relying solely on catchy hooks and a repetitive downbeat (not to say that the beat underlying a number of tracks is anything but infectious, which most certainly is the case with the hard-driving “NO CD”), Carner makes use of limited, and at times acoustic, instrumentation to create a musical soundscape that draws the listener into his own world, but on his own terms. Perhaps what works best for the album and helps in creating an enveloping and cohesive personal world in \u003ci\u003eYesterday’s Gone\u003c/i\u003e are the moments when all instrumentation and musical elements are absent. Throughout the album, Carner brilliantly interweaves samples of field recordings and spoken word that, instead of detracting from the more musical aspects of the rest of the album, manage to create a narrative framework that gives a greater sense of depth to the songs surrounding them. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs for the the music itself, it is anything but lacking. Right from beginning, with the gospel inspired track “The Isle of Arran” to the Velvet Ground B-side reminiscent stylings of the closing track “Yesterday’s Gone,” Carner draws upon a number of genres to craft an album that never lets the listener become accustomed or weary of his noteworthy offerings. It is Carner’s ease with which he so freely experiments with music - from shifting genres to interlinking together personal pictures of his life and his music - that makes this such a great rap album. He allows us a uniquely personal glance into his life that is deeply intriguing and engaging, while never allowing us to grow tired of the sounds that constitute his world.\u003c/p\u003e",

In the video, he can be seen performing a stripped-down version of the song on the instrument that Sisay has treated as his solace ever since it was given to him by his father at the age of three: the piano.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome of his deepest fears, struggles, and his methods of coping with them are underlined in the song within the lines, “Usually I\u0026rsquo;d run home, and tuck the issue under/Oh, sleeping with my worries/I didn\u0026rsquo;t really know what that lump was, my luck.” Sisay explains that he’s usually one to toss his issues to the side, causing them to gather together and cause a “lump” he’s unable to get rid of.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe also explains the alternative meaning to this relentless “lump”. Back in 2011, he discovered a mysterious lump in his throat that persisted after an illness, but the physicians he sought after were unable to find the cause of this lump. After his mom passed away with cancer in 2015, and his father’s death in 1998, this “lump” has been something Sisay has taken seriously health wise, hence his reasoning for including it in an already very emotional piece.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Blood On Me,\u0026rdquo; the second song in the eccentric album, takes a more visual approach to presenting another one of Sisay\u0026rsquo;s internal struggles, his battle with sleep paralysis as a result of guilt that has manifested for quite some time. His sense of imagery and descriptive language can be noted throughout the entire song, adding all the more to the intense and emotive vibe the dark piano and fast-paced background music evoke: “I get up, they\u0026rsquo;re at the edge of my bed/Yeah, how did they find me, find me?/They said there\u0026rsquo;s somethin\u0026rsquo; bleedin\u0026rsquo; in me/Somethin\u0026rsquo; screamin\u0026rsquo; in me/Somethin\u0026rsquo; buried deep beneath.\u0026ldquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen asked to explain \u0026quot;Blood On Me\u0026rdquo; in more detail, Sisay says, \u0026ldquo;I write things like a movie scene. I kind of see the camera angle, and there is someone sort of shaking me out—a Birdseye view of my bed. So there is that thing of someone there to save you from yourself. Or to wake you up out of the dream. It’s like a dog chasing its tail. You never really know where it ends.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom song to song, Sisay’s beautiful runs, musical riffs, and heart-wrenching lyrics that speak of his struggles with his sleep paralysis, grief over the loss of his father and mother, his inability to reach out to his physically disabled brothers, and his internal emotional and physical struggles are what makes this album absolutely unique and haunting. With the help of his glorious piano-playing skills and eccentric instrumental ballads, Sampha has created an album that will no doubt keep audiences on an emotional rollercoaster for years and years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eFavorite Tracks:\u003c/b\u003e “(No One Knows Me) Like The Piano,” “Under,” “Plastic 100 C”\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By: Sam Blake\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date: 3/29/17\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eArt and artists influence how our cities evolve. Over the last several months, I\u0026rsquo;ve been studying gentrification for my Master\u0026rsquo;s in Public Policy capstone project. My group and I have read hundreds of pages, created a survey, and administered it to over 40 small business owners, and conducted 15 interviews with economic and community development advocates, political staff members, real estate developers, and academics. The best, most truthful answer I can give to the simple question of \u003ci\u003eWhat have you learned?\u003c/i\u003e is: \u003ci\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s complicated\u003c/i\u003e. I\u0026rsquo;m writing a Master\u0026rsquo;s thesis on this stuff, so obviously there\u0026rsquo;s more to be said than what can fit in a blog post. I\u0026rsquo;ll take this opportunity, then, to focus on something my team hasn\u0026rsquo;t delved into much, but about which I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking quite a bit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, I must define gentrification. It is the process wherein the \u0026ldquo;desirability\u0026rdquo; of a neighborhood grows and thereby increases demand from people to live and work there. I don\u0026rsquo;t believe that gentrification is inherently bad, and I like this definition because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t presuppose as much. What is bad about gentrification is the potential outcome of this increased demand: land values increase, rents rise, residents and sometimes businesses are displaced because they can no longer afford to pay, and the cultural and historical fabric of a neighborhood is replaced by sterile corporate franchises more beholden to their shareholders than to the communities they have entered. This is a worst-case scenario; there are many outcomes in between, some of which are highly attractive. In the life of a neighborhood, growth and development are important, and stagnation is unhealthy. Finding the right balance between growth and preservation is the challenge. The degree to which the government ought to intervene, especially on the commercial side, is unclear: one\u0026rsquo;s answer depends largely on one\u0026rsquo;s views on the proper role of government and the value one places on the free market. So, yeah: \u003ci\u003eit\u0026rsquo;s complicated\u003c/i\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eArtists are often the first movers into a downtrodden neighborhood, attracted by the low price per square foot, and perhaps by the unvarnished and therefore untarnished look and feel of the place. Someone may open a café with an affordable rent to serve these artists coffee at an affordable price. And so begins the growth of \u0026ldquo;desirability.\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Boyle Heights, a predominantly Latino neighborhood east of downtown LA and the focus of my capstone project, an \u0026ldquo;anti-gentrification collective\u0026rdquo; called Defend Boyle Heights organized last July to protest an artist nonprofit. One might not associate an artist nonprofit as an evil gentrifier, but protesters were upset that the nonprofit did not acknowledge that it was part of the problem. They have demanded all new art galleries to leave the city and let the community decide how to use the property. \u003ca href=\"http://defendboyleheights.blogspot.com/2016/07/defend-boyle-heights-statement-about_6.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t need more galleries,\u0026rdquo; they chanted, \u0026ldquo;We need higher salaries!\u0026rdquo;\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnderlying this battle is another one of the ugly faces that can accompany gentrification: a colonialist, privileged kind of occupation that extends the historical threads of inequity like racist lending practices.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI love people and I love cities and I love art and I love culture. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to destroy anybody\u0026rsquo;s home and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to stifle anybody\u0026rsquo;s creativity. What is the right thing to do?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eComplicated, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs my group finishes its work and submits our recommendations to our client, a local economic and community development nonprofit that seeks to build sustainable, resilient communities, I suppose the actual best answer I\u0026rsquo;ve arrived at is: \u003ci\u003eit\u0026rsquo;s complicated, but it\u0026rsquo;s possible to find the balance between growth and preservation\u003c/i\u003e. It requires awareness and empathy from all sides, especially from those moving into a new place. Enter with a paint brush, an outstretched hand, and a mindset that appreciates what has come before you, and you are more likely to be met with a community willing to share its easels, shake your hand, and appreciate how you can contribute to the ongoing growth of the neighborhood, together.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By: Bethany Rennard\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date: 3/23/17\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFollowing the November presidential election, I made a promise to myself to increase my efforts to support good journalism and be more socially and politically informed. I have found in the subsequent months that one of my favorite ways to consume news is through podcasts. In my trek from my apartment to class, I can learn about anything from the \u003ca href=\"http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/church-sanctuary-part-1/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esanctuary movement\u003c/a\u003e to the role of \u003ca href=\"http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/10-the-satire-paradox\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epolitical satire\u003c/a\u003e. One of the staples in my podcast consumption is \u003ca href=\"https://getcrookedmedia.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCrooked Media\u003c/a\u003e, a progressive independent media company started by three former staffers from the Obama White House. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough I love all of the podcasts produced by Crooked Media, my current favorite is \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/pod-save-the-world/id1200016351?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePod Save the World\u003c/a\u003e, a foreign policy show hosted by Tommy Veitor, former National Security Spokesperson and Assistant White House Press Secretary. Each week, Veitor interviews a foreign policy expert and breaks down the core elements of their work or area of expertise in an accessible way. As someone with limited foreign policy knowledge, I have found the podcast to be a perfect balance of entertainment and education, and always look forward to the weekly release of new episodes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe past week’s episode (released 3/15/17) was especially interesting because Veitor interviewed Glenn Greenwald, a journalist and author best known for reporting on classified documents released by Edward Snowden. Greenwald came on the show to rebuke and respond to criticisms of Snowden made by Veitor and Ben Rhodes in a previous episode. As someone actively forming my own opinions about where to draw the line between ethical and unethical surveillance, I found this episode to be especially informative \u0026ndash; particularly because Veitor and Greenwald were often presenting strong but oppositional arguments. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne argument I found particularly compelling was Greenwald’s assertion that we should distinguish between the ethics of Snowden leaking classified information and the ethics of Snowden leaving the country. When thinking about the case in the past, I had often thought of the two decisions as integrated, assuming that Snowden’s choice to seek asylum in Russia was, at least to some degree, indicative of the morality of his motives. However, I think an argument can be made that Snowden’s choice to avoid prosecution by fleeing the country was fueled by a desire for personal preservation rather than evidence of malicious intentions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother point that intrigued me was Greenwald’s adversarial approach to journalism. When Vietor highlighted the fact that a number of intelligence officials have negative views of Greenwald, the journalist asserted that an independent, free press is supposed to question and antagonize the government, and therefore ensure that the country avoids excessive concentration of power. As critiques of the news and media are more prominent now than ever before, I find it fascinating to consider when (or if) journalists are intended to have positive rapport with the government.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost of all, I loved this episode because it modeled the importance of engaging with those who are ideologically different. Although Veitor and Greenwald were aware that they held different beliefs, they were able to engage one another and critically consider views opposite to their own. In an increasingly partisan and polarizing political landscape, I think conversations such as this are vital now more than ever before.\u003c/p\u003e",

Slightly differing from \u003ci\u003eFUTURE\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003eHNDRXX\u003c/i\u003e expresses Future’s Jimi Hendrix influenced persona who is courageous to sing with auto-tune and create hit-maker catchy beats. From beginning to end, Future discusses love and relationships with women, but from “My Collection” to “Sorry,” he transitions from being a conscious player to an apologizing ex-lover. Contrasting from his other albums, \u003ci\u003eHNDRXX\u003c/i\u003e is somewhat apologetic and accepting of one’s mistakes rather than being depressive or raging towards an ex.\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“My Collection” starts off at a confident level where Future raps about an ex, saying, “She got a few athletes on speed dial/I’m tryna get the case dismissed before I see trial.” He makes it clear that he had a lot of women in his life and keeps his past relationships as his collection. More of his savage mode continues with “Comin’ Out Strong,” featuring The Weeknd. Both hit-makers show off their strength facing with challenges from opponents or most probably haters. “Lookin’ Exotic” furthers Future’s point to prove his power, which he uses to spoil his women with luxury. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe climax of Future’s love for women starts with the upbeat track “Incredible.” He sings, “I was havin\u0026rsquo; trust issues/But I\u0026rsquo;ve been havin\u0026rsquo; way better luck since you/I know it\u0026rsquo;s true love with you,” showing how his new girl is not like his past relationships and how she is the reason this new relationship is “incredible.” He uses the same upbeat rhythm and singing with “Testify” and “Fresh Air,” questioning his girl’s love and attachment for him with lines like, “So you wanna fall for the bad guy?/So you wanna fall and get mad high?/Confess your love for me, testify.” In “Fresh Air,” he sings, “Sand touch your toes while you cookin\u0026rsquo; breakfast/Pacific Ocean out the backyard lookin\u0026rsquo; sexy,” almost painting the scenery of a refreshing new love for his listeners before moving on to the complicated side of his relationships with “New Illuminati.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Selfish,” featuring Rihanna, once again proves that instead of moving on from a toxic relationship caused by both sides’ selfishness, Future finds himself and his girl going back to the broken relationship and getting together for one last time. Reflecting on his consciousness towards his mistakes, Future ends the album with the outstanding track “Sorry,” co-produced by the prodigy beat-maker Metro Boomin. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter showing off his savage rap star persona with \u003ci\u003eFUTURE\u003c/i\u003e, Future justifies that he has multiple personas in him that can create the most ratchet and dirty rap album as well as the most melodic and dramatic mainstream album. The result of this merging of personas is the great Future Hendrix and two number one albums in two consecutive weeks. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eTop Tracks\u003c/b\u003e: “Sorry,” “Comin Out Strong,” “Testify,” “Incredible,” “Selfish”\u003c/p\u003e",

When she first spoke to the audience before the first set of the evening, the venue was very empty, even for an opening act. It was clear that Cosentino wanted this event to be a huge success, so the small initial crowd size was a little unnerving.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSide Eyes began playing precisely at 7:15, right on time according to the set schedule posted on Best Coast’s Twitter account earlier that day. I routinely checked this schedule throughout the night to see who would be playing next, and without fail, every band began playing either on time or early, which felt like a rare treat. Most of the concerts I’ve been to that included multiple acts on a shared stage were marred by delays and long intermissions as tech transitioned from one band to the next. At this event, each band played their set, which ranged from 15 minutes at the shortest (Side Eyes) to 35 minutes at the longest (Best Coast), and then the curtains were closed for 15 to 20 minutes while the technical crew prepared for the next band. Meanwhile, an ensemble of DJs played during each intermission period to maintain the crowd’s energy. This event was clearly well planned and well-rehearsed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned, Side Eyes opened for a somewhat small crowd. I’ll admit, their vibe was a little strange. I\u0026rsquo;d summarize their sound as a barrage of guitar and whiny vocals. The main thing I took away from their set was that their bassist looked like Beetlejuice and the hot pink patent leather boots that the lead singer was wearing are the coolest pair of shoes I\u0026rsquo;ve seen in a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNext on the bill were The Regrettes. This band really impressed me. Before that night I had never listened to their music, but I’d consider myself a converted fan after seeing them play. The strongest song of their set, in my opinion, was “Seashore,” which lead singer Lydia Night dedicated to Donald Trump, the first of many disparaging song dedications that were to occur throughout the night. The band’s sound intermixed an appealing sample of pop with an angsty punk undertone. I was digging it, and so was the crowd. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"4032\" data-orig-height=\"3024\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/be3c597c2b6d8a8906a94a0b60cfc11a/tumblr_inline_omua7eRcjq1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4032\" data-orig-height=\"3024\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter The Regrettes came Lovely Bad Things, who regularly tour with Best Coast. They opened with “Space Waste” before transitioning to “I Just Want You to Go Away,” which was fittingly dedicated to Trump. They closed with a new song that had “never been performed live,” a nice treat for the audience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNext up was MUNA, who recently finished performing with Grouplove on the Big Mess tour. “I Know A Place” felt like an appropriate opener - its lyrics about finding safety and acceptance in the face of adversity seemed to serve as a reminder that Planned Parenthood, although under threat, has a loyal group of supporters who believe in its cause. Lead singer Katie Gavin briefly shared a story of an instance when she and a friend turned to Planned Parenthood in a time of need and then followed the visit with breakfast burritos. The personal story and inclusive lyrics were a nice change of pace and functioned as a much-needed reminder of why this event was occurring and why it’s important to support organizations like Planned Parenthood. On a sidenote, I was really impressed with how well Gavin danced in stilettos and a special award should be given to the band for ‘Best Overall Hair.’\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCosentino returned to the stage to introduce the next band, Veruca Salt. Cosentino stressed that Veruca Salt was hugely influential on her during her teenage years. Louise Post and Nina Gordon were the only two members of the band present, and the duo played a set of five throwback songs. The punk-pop band seemed like a cohesive addition to the lineup, and although their music is from a different alt-rock era, it didn’t seem out of place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNext up was Grouplove, the apparent crowd favorite of the night, as many of the event’s attendees were wearing Grouplove t-shirts. They carried off of Veruca Salt’s pseudo-punk energy by opening with “Borderlines and Aliens,” followed by a high-energy cover of the Beastie Boys’ “Sabotage.” They then slowed down to play “Heart of Mine” off of their most recent album before finishing off the set with fan-favorites “Ways to Go,” “Tongue Tied,” and finally, “Colours.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"4032\" data-orig-height=\"3024\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7bf7e1f84e48a4b56fc5a2d320be35f0/tumblr_inline_omuaea6SqE1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4032\" data-orig-height=\"3024\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eBest Coast was last to take the stage, opening with their hit “Boyfriend,” to which many attendees immediately started singing along. Cosentino later welcomed Liz Phair to the stage, and the two played a couple of songs together. Cosentino told the audience she “felt honored” to be able to say that she’d played a set with the acclaimed songstress. The band then continued to play a number of songs before finishing with “California Nights,” and bidding everyone goodnight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, the Don’t Sit Down Benefit was defined by the three following ideas:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1. Stick to the schedule.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2. Planned Parenthood is important, we can’t afford to lose it, and\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3. Fuck Donald Trump.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was impressed with how coordinated and organized the event was run, and left the night feeling good about whatever monetary contribution I made to Planned Parenthood by attending the event as well as motivated to continue vocally opposing Trump and Republican lawmakers who threaten similar institutions. I’d say that Cosentino can rest assured that the event was successful.\u003c/p\u003e",

data-orig-height=\"360\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eFilm composer Hans Zimmer’s highly-anticipated Hans Zimmer Revealed tour kicked off in Los Angeles at the Microsoft Theater on the cool evening of April 14th, 2017.  With 10 total dates of this special tour set through May in North America, including two Coachella Festival dates, Zimmer prepared a concert showcasing his career-spanning repertoire riddled with guest performers and contributors.  The result was a symphonic rock concert, with more emphasis on the former than the latter, that would please both young and old fans of Hans Zimmer.  The reimagined performances of his scores stayed true to the original recordings for their respective films, but added some rock/pop elements to make the show more engaging and appealing in a live setting.  More into that later.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"2448\" data-orig-width=\"3264\"\u003e\u003cimg

data-orig-width=\"3264\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eTHE SETUP\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis concert was far from just simply a conventional 40-piece classical orchestra setup.  Including Hans, over 50 performers graced the stage.  At the very back on an elevated platform was a 16-person half male, half female choir.  In front of them was a 19-piece orchestra, with a 10-member string section (4 cellos, 6 violins/violas), and a 9-member brass horns section (As per Hans’ style, many French horns).  And, as expected from Hans Zimmer, the percussion section sat in front of the orchestra, with 4 total members serving various duties on drumset, timpani, and xylophone/vibraphone/glockenspiel.  At the very front was Hans and his frontline, including two violinists, one cellist (rocking an electric cello), an upright bassist, three electric guitarists, a bass guitarist, a flutist, and a computer musician (a la Jonny Greenwood style).  Hans often switched between playing banjo, acoustic upright piano, synth, Spanish guitar, and even timpani, a true testament to his musicianship and versatility.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTHE MUSIC\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOK, this is probably why you’re reading this article, because you’re a Hans Zimmer fan.  Yes, he does play your favorites.  Yes, he does them justice.  What’s interesting to note is that this concert isn’t just seeing Hans Zimmer conducting an orchestra replicating his complex soundtracks.  It’s seeing him play with his band and watch how he arranges his soundtracks in a live setting.  Most of the tracks he performed were suites dedicated to each film, finely arranged to transition between the most famous pieces out of those soundtracks.  The setlist is posted at the bottom of the article.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOftentimes you’ll see a description that’ll say he’ll play “reimagined” scores.  Yes, they’re reimagined, but nothing in the likes of Spinal Tap experimenting with cosmic jazz odysseys where it’s odd and strange (I’m looking at you, Herbie Hancock and your classical improvisation endeavours.).  Instead, what he’ll do is he’ll add pop/rock instrumentation into his arrangements to make them more engaging.  For example, when he plays Stay from Interstellar (arguably the most famous and beautiful track from the score), he has the slide guitar play the main melody instead of how the organ and harmonics did in the original Interstellar soundtrack.  He also adds a steady drum pulse on the toms to maintain the pace of Stay, which actually explains why the percussion section is in front of the choir and orchestra: Hans doesn’t conduct them, they just rely on listening to the drummer.  Other examples include the incorporation of a rock drum beat to Inception’s The Dream is Collapsing and Mombasa.  Depending on the piece and arrangement, Hans will throw in the occasional guitar and rock drum beat to pieces that have less defined pacing to make the music more engaging and memorable in a live concert setting (because rock concerts are the only type of concerts worth remembering, right?), but still maintain the true spirit of the original soundtracks that fans have grown to love.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The musical guests are worth a mention.  Many friends and peers of Hans’ appeared in the concert, often introduced by Hans where he would give a personal anecdote and affirmation of respect for them as musicians.  The most significant guests were Lebohang Morake, known as “Lebo M.,” and Carmen Twillie, the original singers from the Lion King soundtrack recordings.  As Hans put it after their surprise appearance, “You may hear the Broadway shows\u0026hellip;but those are all other [singers and actors], this man is the true Lion King!”  Acclaimed composer James Newton Howard also appeared on stage alongside Hans during his Dark Knight Trilogy sequence, where Hans described how he couldn’t have written Bruce Wayne’s sequences without him for Christopher Nolan’s series.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Highlights include The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, Interstellar, Rain Man, Lion King, Pirates of the Caribbean (featuring the talented Tina on cello), Crimson Tide, The Da Vinci Code, Sherlock Holmes, Man of Steel, and Wonder Woman.  Hans truly brings his music to life but manages to arrange them in such a way to create an immersive and energetic live concert experience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"2448\" data-orig-width=\"3264\"\u003e\u003cimg

data-orig-width=\"3264\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eTHE VISUALS\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m one who normally closes my eyes roughly 57.3% of the time at a concert to listen and absorb the music being performed, but I found it difficult to do this time around with all the visual components this show incorporated.  Hans’ live show uses complex lighting adjustments and effects to create an even more immersive concert experience.  Since film rights are a pain to attain, Hans often has visual graphics interspersed with footage of his ensemble members playing their instruments to replace what potentially would have been clips from the films he worked on (Interstellar’s sequences contained a starry field with art deco-style gold buildings, while Man of Steel’s graphics were colorful lines that simulated the motion of flight).  Hans Zimmer’s excellent use of spotlights are another worthy note; often, drummers would be highlighted by having three spotlights pointed at the same drummer but alternating between lighting, creating a quick motion effect that accentuated their complex solo patterns.  The result, overall, is an intensely visual spectacle as much as it is an auditory one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1532\" data-orig-width=\"2720\"\u003e\u003cimg

data-orig-width=\"2720\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eVERDICT:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHans Zimmer’s pieces are difficult to play in a live setting due to their versatility in instrumentation and complexity in composition, but who’s better to arrange them for a live setting than the master composer himself?  Through Hans Zimmer’s impeccable ear, the audience is able to hear his career come to life as a result of his hard work and dedication to music.  His career highlights fans have come to know and love will be done justice and tweaked with some rock elements to create an immersive and energetic experience.  People coming in expecting a film concert are going to get what they expect plus much more: a symphonic rock concert calling back to Hans’ early days as a new wave post-punk musician, but staying true in homage to his success as one of the most important film composers of the modern era.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSetlist: \u003ca

It regulates cycles of sleep and wakefulness by inducing drowsiness, when it is released in the brain. It is also synthetically produced and used medically as a sleep aid. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDr. Marina Popovska-Gorevski, Dr. Margarita L. Dubocovich, and Dr. Rajendram V. Rajnarayanan found that two carbamate compounds, carbaryl and carbofuran, mimic the chemical structure of melatonin. This allows them to attach to melatonin receptors in the brain, producing the same drowsy effect on the human brain as a release of melatonin. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eConcern already exists regarding the medical use of melatonin, with research showing that exposure to melatonin in excess of the amount produced naturally in the brain can create a heightened tolerance to its effects. This means that people who take melatonin to help them sleep actually end up less able to sleep on their own, as their brain does not naturally produce enough melatonin to have an effect on them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCarbamate compounds are found in many commonly used insecticides, including Temik, Sevin, and over 190 other chemicals registered for use in the United States. Though many of these products have been shown to be highly toxic to humans and other animals, this is the first evidence of their adverse effects on the healthy function of basic regulatory processes.\u003c/p\u003e",

They released over ten EPs, albums, and singles since July 2016, with yet another EP set to release in May of this year. Their latest release, \u003ci\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://highsunn.bandcamp.com/album/u-stole-my-heart\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eu stole my heart\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/i\u003e, is truly representative of the band’s unusually frequent, yet quality content that is consistent in form (quick paced romantic surf pop tracks) and intended function (making me cry, at least in my head). The album opens with “Hold Me Tight,” an ode to adolescent obsession fueled by a heavy beat and lead singer Justin Cheromiah’s hollering vocals. It effectively characterizes what is to come: synthesizers, harmonic \u003ci\u003eoohs \u003c/i\u003eand \u003ci\u003eahhs\u003c/i\u003e, and a hauntingly relatable level of angst.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second track presents elements that return to High Sunn’s base, but with a heavier emphasis on instrumentation — specifically percussion — and developing a unified atmosphere. The album continues with a flowing stream of twinkling guitars, soft electronic bumps, and hopeful requests for the affections of a universal crush. Said requests come to represent different forms of desire, with tracks such as “smol doggo” cheerfully imagining an outing to Chinatown contrasting with “spit on me,” a masochistic plea for physical contact, whether mutual or otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DKhNlR-Qwhvs\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KhNlR-Qwhvs?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite these contrasting themes, the base sound of the two tracks remains the same, creating an empathetic listening experience that encapsulates young love: confusion and a lot happening at once, despite the general sentiment remaining the same. High Sunn continues with this pattern, taking short breaks to slow things down in tracks such as “In Your Bed,” which centers around melancholic intimacy over a fluid, synthetic beat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\nThe album ends on a similar note with “Taste My Sadness,” which features a glittering piano and sweetened vocals from Cheromiah that softly sigh throughout the four-minute track. It’s a proper summary of High Sunn’s usual thematic focus: love, loss, and lots of tears, all placed in a scintillating and dreamy pop package.\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

The album can be seen as one of the most solid works from Sean, as the self-explanatory title of the album suggests he has become one of the greatest rappers of his generation. The album is a declaration to all the people who disregarded his talent back in the day and a praise to all the supporters who believed in his talent and perseverance. In every sense Dark Sky Paradise could be seen as a stronger album, but \u003ci\u003eI Decided.\u003c/i\u003e is definitely a more meaningful one, speaking about how Sean became famous and how he cares more about the respect he receives from his loved ones than the money he makes. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStarting with the lyrics \u0026ldquo;Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back,\u0026rdquo; in “Bounce Back,” Sean suggests that every success starts with a loss and the important thing is how a true champion handles that loss and uses it for greater accomplishments. The Metro Boomin collaboration also had an impact to make it a hit way before the album dropped. He teams up further in the album with his superior Detroit native, Eminem, and claims that to be at the top one does not need help from others in “No Favors.” Starting from “Light,” featuring Jeremih, Sean talks about seeing and using your inner potential. The album moves from coming out strong from your losses to finally bossing up in the big league. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom “Owe Me” to “Voices In My Head / Stick To the Plan,” we see Sean  questioning his past relationships and his present realizations about his inner self. He says, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m hangin\u0026rsquo; halfway off the balcony,\u0026rdquo; acknowledging it isn’t only about money, sex, or power but about reality, relationships, and respect throughout his career. The distinction of these particular songs can also be seen musically with more mellow beats and singing. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSean creates another strong hit track featuring Migos with “Sacrifices,” where he says, \u0026ldquo;I came a long way from that Marvin and Chardonnay,\u0026rdquo; rapping about his first official platinum track and how he has made many sacrifices to be where he is right now and improve his music. With “Bigger Than Me,” Sean sums up the overall message of the album, saying his job is not done now that he is at the top and he should and will continue giving back to the people who look up to him and have supported him to be here. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\n\u003cb\u003eTop Tracks: \u003c/b\u003e“Bounce Back,” “No Favors,” “Halfway Off the Balcony,” “Sacrifices,” “Owe Me”\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By: Conner Lund\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date: 3/30/17\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe “American Health Care Act,” the proposed healthcare bill championed by House Speaker Paul Ryan, has seen its demise after the bill was pulled per Trump’s request, leaving doubt within the GOP party now struggling to find a silver lining.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe bill, set to replace Obamacare, had devastating consequences for many Americans. Shortly after the bill was made public, the nonpartisan \u003ca href=\"https://www.cbo.gov\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCongressional Budget Office\u003c/a\u003e released a \u003ca href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52486\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ereport\u003c/a\u003e that put the bill under scrutiny. The report found that 24 million more Americans would be uninsured by 2026 under the proposed bill. In total, 52 million people could be uninsured by 2026.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Ryan stood alone at the podium, it was clear that he was disappointed in the GOP and the White House for not agreeing on the future of healthcare, something the party and Trump had expressed as one of the first and most pressing issues facing the new administration. Now the Republicans are struggling to regain their legitimacy as a legislative force after their first attempt at governing ended so abruptly; starting with a loss means it will be an uphill battle to unify under differing conservative ideals. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile Ryan was certainly passionate about the new bill, many conservatives and liberals alike were not. The CBO findings proved to be quite alarming to middle and lower-class Americans, as well as the elderly. Planned Parenthood would have seen harsher restrictions and regulations regarding public coverage, while the top tenth of a  percent of earners with an average income of $3.9 million or more would have seen an average tax cut of $207,000 a year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore worrisome is the backlash the Trump administration is facing after Trump’s repeated claims that repealing Obamacare would be one of the first measures of his presidency. Now, Trump must somehow explain the GOP implosion after their first major act came to such an abrupt ending with so much backlash. While under fire, Trump cited the Democrats as the reason the bill was pulled.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile Ryan, the champion of the bill, seemed passionate about what this could mean for Americans, it was clear that he stood alone. During the press conference after the bill was pulled, Ryan defeatedly said that if the party couldn’t agree on a new alternative to Obamacare, then Obamacare would stay as “the law of the land”.\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By: Alex Ivanova\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date: 3/24/17\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI fully attribute my English fluency to Sesame Street, Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood, and the various programs that aired on PBS when I was a child. Growing up in a Russian-speaking household, television was my only real exposure to the English language until I started school. Ultimately, public broadcasting meant being able to assimilate into the culture and language of this country, even if my household was of a different one. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor many children like me, PBS and other local public stations were especially influential to our education. A major facet of public media is its commitment to early learning, as seen with the Ready to Learn initiative in the early 1990s, which was later reauthorized by the No Child Left Behind Act in 2002, and renewed in 2010 for another five years. This partnership between the U.S. Department of Education, Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and countless other public media sources meant that “high need” children (children of immigrants, children with low access to educational resources, low-income families, disadvantaged minorities, etc.) would have access to content to expand their math and literacy skills \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLiteracy in a nation is more than just a positive - it is necessary and vital to a nation’s economic stability. A one percent increase in literacy scores ultimately results in an eventual two and a half percent rise in labor productivity, and a one and a half percent rise in GDP per person (C.D. Howe Institute). Despite this, in 2015, only 34-percent of  eighth grade students performed at or above the proficient level, declining two percent from 2013 (National Assessment of Educational Progress).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePresident Trump recently proposed massive budget cuts for our domestic programs— namely cutting agency funds for the arts, humanities, and public media. White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney defended the proposal, saying, “Can we really continue to ask a coal miner in West Virginia or a single mom in Detroit to pay for these programs? The answer was no. We can ask them to pay for defense and we will, but we can\u0026rsquo;t ask them to continue to pay for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.” Yet public media only costs approximately $1.35 per citizen, per year, according to CPB President and CEO Patricia Harrison. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe benefits of public broadcasting certainly outweigh whatever potential benefits can result from allocating those funds to increasing the defense budget yet again. Ultimately it is only a disservice to educating our children and providing information to all citizens, both in urban, rural, and disadvantaged communities. The benefits of the Ready to Learn Initiative are not unfounded. Over a fourth of the money funding the initiative went to researching its success, and ultimately, the results supported that public programming increased literacy skills when comparing a group of at-risk students who viewed various PBS shows, and control groups of students who did not. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, the majority of viewers were children from economically disadvantaged families, the majority of which were making less than $50,000 a year. In a recent Washington Post publication entitled, “Public Broadcasting Shouldn’t Get a Handout from Taxpayers Anymore,” Howard Husock claims that minorities can “find what they are looking for” on private media and major cable outlets, claiming that “public media today looks far too much like a niche programming service for a left-leaning, upmarket urban constituency.” In some ways, his article is valid. Public media often does serve a niche market, with many viewers moving towards the private media industry to find programs that cater directly to them. It is important for public media to broaden its focus now more than ever when competing with other forms of media, especially as the internet becomes more and more influential on consumer tastes. We cannot, however, expect this to be a reality if we diminish public media’s already low funds exponentially by defunding them entirely. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump’s call to zero-out public media funding is frightening, especially to the vast amounts of disadvantaged communities who depend on it. However, it also serves as a wake-up call to public media outlets to adapt to growing demands as competition with private markets increases, and they cannot depend simply on their role as a public service to convince a conservative government to allocate funding to them.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By: Angel Aparicio\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date: 3/20/17\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn March 4, President Donald Trump set off yet another media firestorm when he seemingly out of the blue tweeted that former president Barack Obama had Trump Tower’s “wires tapped” before his winning the presidency. “Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!” the president tweeted, before continuing to post, “Is it legal for a sitting president to be “wire tapping” a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!” and, “How low has President Obama gone to tap my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe claims were largely unsubstantiated, as Trump has yet to offer any evidence, but speculation has focused on a Breitbart article published on March 3, the day before Trump’s respective tweets, that outlined the steps conservative radio host Mark Levin claimed then-President Obama took to bug Trump Tower. This begs the question of whether Trump trusts far-right news outlets over the United States government intelligence community, as the POTUS has offered no evidence or retraction for the claims despite government agencies acknowledging there is no proof. Furthermore, the tweets mark the first time a sitting president has made such an explosive, unsubstantiated claim against their predecessor. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTwo days later, Sean Spicer, White House press secretary, did little to assuage the situation when he said he would “let the tweets speak for themselves” at a press conference. Nearly a week later, on the 14th, Spicer offered slight clarity on what exactly the president meant by those claims, saying Trump did not literally mean wiretapping; rather, he used the word to mean surveillance in general. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis mirrors the behavior of other governments under “strongman” leadership, like Rodrigo Duterte’s government in the Philippines, which has defended his bombastic claims of murdering drug dealers by stating his claims were rhetorical, and not meant to be taken literally. And though Trump has not explicitly doubled down on wiretapping specifically, he says his administration would be “submitting things before the committee very soon,” apparently referencing the House Intelligence Committee. Though no evidence has been presented or made public, Trump remains steadfast and seemingly confident in his accusations. Either a sitting president had a presidential candidate’s headquarters bugged, or a sitting president is slipping into paranoia and being fed misinformation - only time will tell. \u003c/p\u003e",

It is important to be conscious of all the information and influences that we constantly take in everyday, especially with the internet. Often times people can be misguided or misinterpret the things they see or hear. For example, a person can become misguided in trying to determine what success is by coming across a “successful” person’s Instagram page. The vision for Nü Indigo is to share mentorship experiences from people who have developed an artistry within their craft to foster a better understanding of success.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow do you spread your good vibes and make radio a shared experience if you’re on air by yourself addressing an audience you can’t see?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI once heard that you become the average of the five people you spend the most time with. This is why I make an effort to be around people who are positively aspiring and actively making their visions come true. I figured Nü Indigo could be a good platform to share the experience of being around these types of individuals with others. Even if the audience can’t be seen, I believe there are many values that the audience can draw from these conversations. Music and hearing a message are among the few things in the world that can put a person in a better feeling place regardless of where they are. Hearing a certain song or message can completely change the course of a person’s day. Therefore I try to use that power of music and message to improve any listener’s day, even just by a little.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1367\" data-orig-height=\"2048\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aa4dd6a9acc5ed97cb94f0a1faf1862e/tumblr_inline_omzj4pyG8c1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1367\" data-orig-height=\"2048\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eTalk about one of your favorite guests you’ve had on the show so far.

Off the top of my head, the ones in particular that stand out would have to be Natey, Lido, and Tyler Cole. Natey is a super talented singer/songwriter/producer, and he shared how to really just enhance the quality of living. Some of the things he shared in our conversation have personally gotten me through some of my tougher times. Lido was also really cool to have, as I’ve been a huge fan of his music and we got to go into depth about his creative songwriting process. Tyler Cole was also a cool guest as we briefly got into conversation about Indigo and what it is. Many of my guests have come as a surprise, so I am looking forward to see what surprises await in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"843\" data-orig-height=\"843\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/149b2b7c108c62ee8894d86b88a633b6/tumblr_inline_omzj3r8zPv1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"843\" data-orig-height=\"843\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe graphic designs you have for your show are incredibly sick.

I am personally a huge fan of motivational podcasts. But I realized that many of these podcasts were primarily based around entrepreneurship, and I could not find any that were purely focused on the creative fields. I thought that it would’ve been very helpful growing up if something like Nü Indigo existed, allowing artists to directly give advice on things such as how to get started, how to find internships, creative processes, and even controversial topics like whether school is truly necessary, all while giving the artists a platform to tell their story without it being twisted like many media outlets do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3365\" data-orig-height=\"1245\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d977456198237f59a4db0bc0789ca24a/tumblr_inline_omzjc9ic2Q1qhakxc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3365\" data-orig-height=\"1245\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\n\u003cb\u003eFollow \n\n\u003cb\u003eNü Indigo\u003c/b\u003e on \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nuindigoofficial/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e and listen in every Wednesday at 3 p.m. with DJ Medafiziks every on \u003ca href=\"http://uclaradio.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003euclaradio.com\u003c/a\u003e!\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Yellow journalism was flaunting its amarillo curls in the late 1800s and continued well into the 20th century. If you define fake news as the intentional distortion of truth - whether through omission, sensationalism, or unsubstantiated reporting - you\u0026rsquo;d even have to include on your list of perpetrators the religious institutions that managed the dissemination of printed information to the masses.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009What\u0026rsquo;s new, by definition, is the present era. Information flows at a rapid pace across a global network connecting billions of people. Whereas previous generations accessed news and opinion from a relatively small variety of sources, an internet search today on any given topic yields more results from more sources than one person could ever reasonably need or want. The \u0026ldquo;democratization\u0026rdquo; of media is a nice idea, but we are so flooded by information and data and ideas that it is hard to make sense of the world. We need a filter mechanism. Enter the arbiters of information: Facebook, Google, and friends.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009There\u0026rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong with a filter. We use them all the time. Heuristics - rule-of-thumb instincts that guide our reactions to external stimuli - help us avoid being overwhelmed by all the noise around us that\u0026rsquo;s constantly knocking on the doors of our mind, demanding to be processed. Still, it\u0026rsquo;s important to realize the negative implications of relying on heuristics, however sensible that reliance may be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009A heuristic is a bias. Research abounds on the unconscious biases to which we are all susceptible. Tests on our blink-of-an-eye reactions to a white person compared to a black person, for instance, have brought these biases to the light of day. To move past our biases, the first step is to become conscious of them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Thanks to fake news, we are now conscious of the role that information filters and algorithms like Facebook and Google play in our lives. In the Presidential election, we saw how radically different people\u0026rsquo;s social media lives were depending on how their online behavior and that of their social networks fit into the on-high algorithms. And, according to some sources, we saw significant consequences from this, like the \u003ca href=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/online-hoaxes-fake-news-played-role-election/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003einfluencing of voting behavior for the leader of the world\u0026rsquo;s most powerful country\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009This new era requires new rules. Rules can either be officially enshrined as law, or they can permeate from our ethical codes of conduct. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t envy any legislator or civil servant tasked with designing a comprehensive, adaptable law governing information flows that would be effective, constructive and enforceable. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure it\u0026rsquo;s even possible. Some stop gap measures can be passed, but the way forward is through ethics. And a tricky thing about ethics is that if you dig into the reasons why a given code of conduct exists, and you keep asking why, like the Louis CK \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJlV49RDlLE\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ejoke\u003c/a\u003e, you inevitably end up with an answer like… “Well because it\u0026rsquo;s the right thing to do, dude.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The hubs that have outsize control of our digital flows of information must be ethical, and the only way to make them do it is through the power of the people. In this era, we are all responsible for holding them accountable. Each of us must practice and expect the kind of ethics we want to see in the world — this is the way that ethics are spread and upheld. We must be transparent with each other. We must respect and listen to each other. We must be the force from which the ideals we want to live by are generated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009To achieve this, it is important not to be overly cynical. Be critical, be skeptical, but don\u0026rsquo;t be cynical. Be aware of the fact that what you read may be true, tinged with fiction, or overflowing with falsehood. But don\u0026rsquo;t let that awareness keep you from seeking truth, or from believing in one another. These problems have been around for a long time, and while we\u0026rsquo;ve still got a ways to go in terms of moving our world closer to its ideal version, we\u0026rsquo;ve come a long way. To go further, it\u0026rsquo;s up to us.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By: Sam Blake\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date: 4/19/17\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany of life\u0026rsquo;s great questions reveal themselves only through experience. So it was, that, at a Sigur Ros concert I attended some time ago in New York City, I found myself in a situation demanding an ethical response. My decision would, undoubtedly, set the standard of behavior I would need to follow for the rest of my life. For what is a man if he is not consistent?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe situation reminded me of one of my favorite moments in \u003ci\u003eThe Simpsons\u003c/i\u003e - arguably the greatest show of all time if, and only if, one considers only seasons one through twelve. Otto, the headphoned bus driver, is sitting at a concert in a stadium chair. He is eager, as one would expect, to have his face melted by his revered gods of rock. Yet, he finds himself in a most bogus situation: he cannot see the stage. \u0026ldquo;Sit down!\u0026rdquo; he yells in his gravelly voice. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re ruining it for us all!\u0026rdquo; Out of the entire sold-out theater, however, he is literally the only one who is not standing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the Sigur Ros concert, I was seated for the opening act. I was relaxed, and my view of the stage was primo: my buddy and I were in the first row of seats just behind the general admission floor. It seemed like an incredible bargain. This is how the symphony-goers watch music: just killin\u0026rsquo; it. I figured I might as well continue this bargain bourgeoisie experience while I had it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen, waves of people down in the general admission area begin standing up from their floor seats. They ripple from just in front of the stage back to my row and fizzle out shortly thereafter. I can no longer see. The people just behind me, though, who are still sitting–they can. I\u0026rsquo;m trapped.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat do I do? If I keep sitting, I can hardly see the stage. If I stand, the people sitting people won\u0026rsquo;t be able to see.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeveral Otto-like grumblers emerged from the crowd to my rear to yell at the people who had stood up. Unlike our beloved bus driver, though, the Madison Square Garden crowd didn\u0026rsquo;t bother pretending that they cared for anyone else\u0026rsquo;s enjoyment. Instead, they voiced their discontent in slightly more antagonistic language. The common refrain was something like, \u0026ldquo;Sit the fuck down, asshole!\u0026rdquo; \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m teetering. I remain seated as I think it through. It\u0026rsquo;s certainly cool that a live band is playing up there, very close to me. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t come to this concert merely to have my ears titillated nor to be excited by proximity. I came to see the music being played. And I could only see if I stood.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDecision time. To sit or to stand? If I do what the Ottos behind me want and continue sitting, only they will be able to see. If I do what the Ottos do not want, only I will be able to see. But if we both do what we sort of do not want to do, well, then we will all be able to see.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I stood. I felt, and still feel, that I made the right choice. The ethical choice. A choice that allowed us all to bask in the beauty and the intensity that is a Sigur Ros concert. And so, my friends, I hereby bequeath this experience and the accompanying wisdom to you. Let it be known: it is okay to stand, even if a bus driver behind you adamantly wishes otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e",

After being signed to XO, NAV got straight to work on his debut mixtape. He produces most of his own work, and while this is usually something worth noting as a positive aspect, most of the tape sounds sparse and thin. In fact, many of the synths that NAV uses on his tape sound like presets found on your friendly neighborhood DAW. The opener, “Myself,” is one of the few exceptions to this critique; the track contains wavy, atmospheric pads running through gates, creating interesting chord hits that play after the main hook. NAV rap-sings through the entire piece, reusing the same melodies over and over and over. This type of delivery makes it so NAV’s hooks and verses become inseparable from one another; The verses also feel drab and uninspired as a result of this stylistic decision. At the end of the opener, NAV essentially flexes the fact that he is behind the boards on his own tape - he chops and screws the last minute of the song’s hook. This is probably most fun to listen to while faded out of one’s mind, however. A special compliment in regards to the opener is that it establishes NAV’s sound and lyrical pathway. Aside from this, it doesn’t sound like a fleshed out piece. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe track “NAV” contains a sour, awkward melody that is bashed over and over and over once again from hook to verse to hook to verse. One would probably find this song more interesting if NAV added substance to his lyrics. He brags about “not paying for sneakers,” “getting money, fucking bitches, popping tags,” etc. Not that there’s anything wrong with writing these kinds of lyrics, but the entire mixtape follows this same formulaic type of writing and delivery. NAV always manages to deliver the following type of lyric: “I did this, now I do this.” And this can be found on every song, without exception. “Good for It” presents the listener with a decent melody, so it is not as drab to listen to. The track features a beat that has some underlying tones and synth notes that breathe a little bit more life into the music. However, about halfway through the song NAV attempts to place his vocals on emphasis, and the lyrics, once again, shine through as bland… wash-rinse-repeat. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe track “Up” delivers the greatest absurdity in terms of lyrical content when compared to all of the other tracks on the tape. In fact, one can argue that, “Now she gimme head outside of TOYS R US,” is a great contender for worst rap lyric of 2017, a bar so uncalled for that I laughed vigorously for a good 30 seconds. It is a real shame too that the beat is a little more subdued and one can hear the Metro Boomin side of the production in the watery bass and sporadic hi hats. NAV truly comes off as a child that stole all of rap’s cliches. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Interlude” is an okay moment on the record. NAV’s singing feels a little more true and emotional, but that just might be the fact that it is mostly a spacey, drug-tinged instrumental piece more than anything. Moving on, I could have sworn I heard the track “Sleep” before on the same album. “Mariah” contains the most pleasing hook on the entire record - NAV’s singing is airy and done in a very breathy manner. Aside from this, the track once again falls to the same faults that the rest of the album. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Weeknd makes his obligated appearance on NAV’s record on “Some Way.” Abel essentially steals the track from NAV; he outshines his minor in vocal performance and overall relation to the instrumentals. NAV sings, “Haters gonna say this shit is whack.” Well I personally don’t believe that one has to be a “hater” to agree that most of this can be labeled “whack.” Yet one still has to commend NAV for being somewhat different from the rest of the hip hop crowd. The difference is NAV sings so much that he can’t be boxed into hip hop, yet he doesn’t sing proficiently enough to be boxed in R\u0026amp;B. In retrospect, NAV can’t be boxed into anything, just as he croons on “Myself.”\u003c/p\u003e",

This can lead to confusion and misinterpretation of reality. However, the biggest issue surrounding fake news is not the news itself. “Yellow journalism,” or rather sensationalist and crudely exaggerated journalism, has been around for over a hundred years. The real problem in this era of mass information is discerning the fake news from the real news. This issue is especially rampant on sites like Facebook and Twitter, where random assortments of individuals and groups post “news articles” daily, coming from generic “news sites” that may or may not be based in fact. Many beg the question: how do we tell fact from fiction?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs of 2016, 62 percent of U.S. adults get some of their news, if not most of it, from online social media platforms, like Facebook, Twitter, or Reddit, \u003ca href=\"http://www.journalism.org/2016/05/26/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2016/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eaccording to the Pew Research Center.\u003c/a\u003e Already, fake news has been identified as an issue on these websites. Facebook has been blamed and criticized for allowing fake news stories to circulate and confuse voters during the recent presidential election. \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10103269806149061\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has come out saying\u003c/a\u003e that the issue of false information is of concern to the company, and that Facebook would work with the community and journalists to try and find a solution. Yet there are many issues that arise when trying to deal with the detection and removal of false news articles. From fact-checking stories and citations to reviewing the writer’s authenticity and past works, those that decide between fact and fiction could add their own judgements to the mix. Social media conglomerates could put filters on information that doesn’t align with their, or their investors, ideologies and interests. Another issue with fixing fake news is that many individuals have no real incentive to check the authenticity of what they read in the first place. Fake news often circulates because no one taking the time to click on articles to read them. \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/07/how-the-average-american-gets-their-news/490244/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAn article by \u003ci\u003eThe Atlantic \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003efound that, “only about a quarter of social-media users regularly click through to read a news story on social media.” Most internet users simply read over the clickbait title full of inflammatory and emotional energy. It is apathetic to have a real conversation that breeds mistrust online and polarizes issues to a point where they seemingly cannot be discussed anywhere. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaking sure that the information we share online is credible is not only productive, but beneficial to our society. From an ethical point of view, we must take care and be responsible for what we do and do not share with our friends and family online. The internet has interconnected all our information, and it is important that rules and guidelines are formed to moderate and discern these volumes of information. \u003c/p\u003e",

There are various hints of The Shins’ past on \u003ci\u003eHeartworms\u003c/i\u003e, such as the Shakespeare reference in “Name For You.” However, this new album - the first in five years - sounds distinctly separate from the band\u0026rsquo;s previous works.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe title \u0026ldquo;Heartworms\u0026rdquo; refers to a creature which invades, a nuisance, a parasite. I cannot help but feel that fans of The Shins\u0026rsquo; earlier albums will interpret the increased synthesizer usage on\u003ci\u003e Heartworms\u003c/i\u003e as acting in a similar way, overwhelming the songs\u0026rsquo; lyrics and pulling The Shins away from their past albums characterized by simpler rhythms and poignant prose. The lyrics of \u0026ldquo;Fantasy Island\u0026rdquo; ache of the emotional anxiety suffered by frontman James Mercer during his rather nomadic childhood, but you can barely make them out under the pulse of the synth-heavy song. What could have been a beautiful, introspective, stripped-down number instead sounds like STRFKR has invaded it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Mildenhall\u0026rdquo; returns to the simpler sound of the earlier Shins, but \u0026ldquo;Rubber Ballz\u0026rdquo; soon brings back the synth. It should also be noted that \u0026ldquo;Rubber Ballz\u0026rdquo; harks to the parasitic theme introduced by the title, as Mercer gripes about his unending lust for a troublesome lover. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe album makes a confusing change of pace with \u0026ldquo;Half A Million,\u0026rdquo; which I\u0026rsquo;d describe as the ‘one thing’ that is not like the others. The song is a catchy, pandering anthem to partying and seems devoid of any past elements of The Shins\u0026rsquo; sound. \u0026ldquo;Dead Alive\u0026rdquo; then harks back to the sad nostalgia of \u0026ldquo;Fantasy Island,\u0026rdquo; further separating \u0026ldquo;Half A Million\u0026rdquo; as an odd track on the album. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DIzfQCsDTORM\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IzfQCsDTORM?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe album\u0026rsquo;s title track, \u0026ldquo;Heartworms,\u0026rdquo; feels like The Shins of \u003ci\u003eWincing The Night Away\u003c/i\u003e while building on the album\u0026rsquo;s established theme. Mercer sings of the futility of trying to impress a cold woman and his frustrating inability to rid himself of the feelings he has been infested with. \u0026ldquo;Now I\u0026rsquo;m trying to figure out when it was you gave me these heartworms/I feel them wriggling in my blood, you gonna do me harm,\u0026rdquo; one verse states in blatant metaphor.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;So Now What\u0026rdquo; is an annoying addition to the album, likely only included because the track appears in the film \u0026ldquo;Wish I Was Here.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Fear\u0026rdquo; is an appropriate closer. It is as emotionally wrought as \u0026ldquo;Fantasy Island,\u0026rdquo; with subtle psychedelic notes lent by the synth and mellotron, yet it maintains the lyrical pathos that has come to define The Shins. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you liked \u003ci\u003ePort of Morrow\u003c/i\u003e, then it is likely that you will be pleased with \u003ci\u003eHeartworms\u003c/i\u003e. However, for those who fancy The Shin\u0026rsquo;s earlier work, \u003ci\u003eHeartworms\u003c/i\u003e leaves something to be desired. Although well intentioned, the use of the synth left me yearning for something more stripped. The growing use of this type of sound with each of The Shin\u0026rsquo;s subsequent albums feels almost as invasive and unwarranted as the creature for which this most recent release was named after. If The Shin\u0026rsquo;s release of a \u0026ldquo;flipped\u0026rdquo; version of \u0026ldquo;Name For You\u0026rdquo; is any indication of their future work, it is unlikely that listeners similar to myself will be appeased with a return to the band\u0026rsquo;s older releases.\u003c/p\u003e",

Every time I think about it, I want to smash my guitar like those guys in creepy metal bands like I have some predisposition against “the man,” throw my keyboard out the window like that badass old lady in Zombieland, and proclaim an existence of silence before tying my vocal chords into a knot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAttending small house shows, performing at them, and seeing my friends play the same game, leaves me in this place of not-so-quiet contemplation concerning one word—individuality. Certainly, a shitty college apartment or an underground warehouse—with the same lo-fi static, cut off jeans, apathetic eye rolls, and “Add us on SoundCloud!”—are places where you will find very tiny amounts of it. I don’t care how underground and experimental you think it is. It’s not.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs an influx of musicians scheme their way through exclusive DIY communities, it’s hard to distinguish true creativity. Everything becomes a bland, hackneyed line of formulaic music. Music communities originally formed on the intent of wild expression have become a basic need for musicians to receive populist validation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s all overproduction. It has deformed authenticity and rugged individualism into a plastic model of what people want to listen to. Because we’re lazy. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMusicians (some, not all) know what they want to play because they know what other people want to hear. Sure, you can play guitar. Sure, you have a stellar set of pipes—but where is the creativity? Anyone can play three noisy chords. Anyone can listen to a vocal riff and copy it without a hitch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLikewise, in the form of other genres, anyone can read an inspiring lyric and write something that mirrors it. But where is the authenticity in that? How can being a ‘creative’ be authentic when every person’s music is a derivative of something that has been done thousands of times before? You can’t keep recycling old ideas and passing them off as individuality. Everyone else is doing that. This pseudo-individuality is overdone and frankly, it’s boring.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn his essay “E Unibus Pluram,\u0026ldquo; David Foster Wallace proposes that the next literary, or artistic, era is going to be littered with “anti-rebels,” who “treat old untrendy human troubles and emotions in U.S. life with reverence and conviction.” He goes on to say, “These anti-rebels would be outdated, of course, before they even started. Too sincere. Clearly repressed…Real Rebels, as far as I can see, risk things. Risk disapproval. The new rebels might be the ones willing to risk the yawn, the rolled eyes, the cool smile, the nudged ribs, the parody of gifted ironists, the ‘How banal.’” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut what happens when we have started producing mass sincerity, individuality, or experimentalism in order to gain a profit to the point where “sincerity” and “individualism” are things that are as common as traffic on the 405 at 3 p.m.? People like relatable artists. People like realness. What happens when realness isn’t real anymore? Sincerity has become the standard for music and has done people’s thinking for them. It makes people forget that what they are listening to is wholly intended for them and is predigested rather than a true reflection of the artist. It becomes no more than a means to an end. Why can’t sentimentality be the end?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrying to be wholly authentic, wholly emotional, or wholly “individual” seems like it’s an effort to rally against the status quo. However, as every musician gets the wise idea of rebellion, they become a humdrum cliche. I was having this conversation with a good friend of mine and he said that for music to be considered “good,” and non-cliche essentially, it has to have a quality of inspiration and a knack for drawing people in—emotionally and also with outstanding musicianship. But in a culture where every person is producing similarity and wiping out originality, how do we differentiate between what is genuine and what is solely trying to make a profit or appeal to a larger audience? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany of those artists, who have tried to write music solely for themselves, have been perfectly molded into these stereotypes, against all their efforts, simply because there are a million other musicians exactly like them. Any attempts at trying to break into the realm of inspiration to others is impossible when the credibility of uniqueness has become nullified. People are so used to hearing “rawness” and “realness” that their ears are used to it. They have become tuned to this song of predigested overstimulation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSure, you can say that this idea is elitist and only appeals to avant garde music and classical pieces—music that plays to the unreached imagination and successfully fulfills the emotional human need. But it’s not. It’s not necessarily about writing something strange. You can’t create new instruments. You can’t create new sounds. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the current climate of political intensity, authenticity is no longer enough. Individualism is only of service to those creating it. Getting people to move is what we need. So maybe our place in the musical realm isn’t solely to be ourselves and create new things. Instead, we should pander to this collective idea—in a real positive way. In a way that incites action and creates change in a place where people often feel misguided and marginalized.\u003c/p\u003e",

After a series of meltdowns, breakups, and the 82 minute album\u003ci\u003e …And Star Power\u003c/i\u003e, that despite its length felt unfinished, Foxygen has turned around with a truly “genuine” album. The Los Angeles duo’s characteristically seventies-esque sound is maintained, but this time with structure and continuity throughout the album. \u003ci\u003eHang\u003c/i\u003e sounds distinctly more mature than Foxygen’s previous works. It features guest contributions from the Lemon Twigs and the Flaming Lips’ Steve Drozd. While still superfluous in sound, the chaos in their preceding albums is replaced with a forty-piece orchestra, maintaining their instrumentally excessive quality. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eReleased in the midst of the election of a controversial leader, lyrically, \u003ci\u003eHang\u003c/i\u003e is appropriately political. The opening track, “Follow the Leader,” advises that the only leader that is worth following is you, possibly alluding to the newly elected president and outbreak of protests that followed. The following track “Avalon” warns of impending “nasty weather.” The fourth track, “America,” is somewhat more clearly political, stating, “If you\u0026rsquo;re already there, then you\u0026rsquo;re already dead/If you\u0026rsquo;re living in America, whoa/Our heroes aren\u0026rsquo;t brave, they\u0026rsquo;ve just got nothing to lose/Because they\u0026rsquo;re all living in America.” The track later references Hollywood and the roles “you” play, potentially alluding to the celebrity intertwined with modern politics. The album closes with, “Rise up, see for yourself/You got to pull yourself up/From the fires of Hell/Rise up, and see for yourself/When all the world\u0026rsquo;s gone/Nobody else.” A call to action perhaps?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaybe this analysis is misinterpreted and the political references previously assumed are merely desperately created mirages not intended by its creators; however, in the current political climate and in an age of artists using their work to make political statements, this analysis could very possibly be valid. \u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Served on a Silver Platter: Reviewing Salome at the LA Opera",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By: Aaron Peretz\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date: 3/21/17\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis season of the LA Opera began its wane in conjunction with the onset of spring and the production of Richard Strauss’s \u003ci\u003eSalome.\u003c/i\u003e Originally written at the close of the 19th century, the opera’s libretto was written by Strauss himself (following a relaxed sense of Gesamtkunstwerk in the Wagnerian tradition) after the Oscar Wilde play under the same name. The parable comes from the Bible. Its title is derived from the protagonist Salome, the daughter of stepfather King Herod (of mandates decreeing the death of male babies notoriety) and hermother Herodias. At the nascent age of 15, her beauty is already renowned throughout the kingdom, and all men find themselves snookered by her - including her stepfather. A precocious youth, she resents her controlling and lascivious parents but is aware of her beauty so that she often manipulates others to get what she wants.\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring a royal banquet, Salome storms out of the hall and hears the wails of a man locked in the palace cistern. The voice belongs to the prophet John the Baptist. Rumors have spread throughout the palace regarding Herod’s fear of the prophet. Salome feels compelled to see the object of her stepfather’s fear, and convinces a guard into temporarily releasing him (after breaking his position’s oath, he kills himself.) Salome finds within John the Baptist an overwhelming purity, a chasteness of soul that she compares to her own virginity. The prophet averts his eyes from the youth and decries her advances on him. He returns to his prison warning her to visit Jesus or to expect a violent end. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHer stepfather approaches her following this interaction. Desperate for the love of Salome, he promises her anything in exchange for a dance. Salome takes up the king’s offer seeing a chance to incite the jealousy of her mother, and fulfill her passions. The following scene is accompanied by the legendary “Dance of the Seven Veils” and garnered a lot of notoriety at the production’s inaugural performance due to the suggestive nature of a teenager stripping. A satisfied Herod follows through on his promise to give anything to Salome. Moved by the shame of denial, she asks for the head of John the Baptist on a silver platter. Herod ultimately gives in to her demands.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFollowing the death of the prophet, Salome muses over her own executive ability. As she dances with the head, her parents silently enter the scene. The opera comes to its zenith as Salome comes through on her promise and kisses the lips of John the Baptist. Herod sentences her to death, and the curtains fall.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a repeat opera goer, I cannot attest enough to the profundity of the music. Few operas that I’ve attended have yielded such a strong physiological response on my part, with goosebumps and palpitations and so-forth. Strauss’s music projects a noticeably more contemporary sound than its predecessors—his sound’s motifs are much closer to the character of modern film scores than, say, Mozart. The impact of Salome’s kiss remains un-betrayed despite a popular overexposure of sex and violence in 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe opera considers themes of jealousy and power, but perhaps most evident is the love of the unattainable. The cadence and form of the content mirrors the phenomenon of post-coital tristesse. Both Herod and Salome ultimately achieve some minimized version of that which they most want (each a carnal desire). But the consequences for both are destructive. Herod’s love devolves to shame and anger at witnessing Salome’s kiss on the detached head of John the Baptist. Salome, in turn, is met by her death after attaining only the phantasm of her desire. Even the guard who helped Salome in the opening scene killed himself after her persuasive flirtations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis dichotomy of that which is within and beyond our grasp is extended to the character of John the Baptist. Framed as the only spiritually pure character in the opera, he strives to move beyond the earthly realm. An initial reading of the opera may suggest a lionization of Christian asceticism, but review calls this first thought into question. To emphasize his disconnection to the earthly realm, John the Baptist is only seen in one scene while his disembodied voice haunts the palace throughout the opera. Of course, his conviction pales in comparison to the lord Jesus Christ who is never seen nor heard in \u003ci\u003eSalome\u003c/i\u003e. This naturally calls into question the enduring faith over someone or something that may be nonexistent. However, John becomes closest of anyone to fulfilling his desire, viz. achievement of the ascetic ideal. This is represented by his death.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStrauss wrote a tone poem after Nietzsche’s treatise \u003ci\u003eThus Spoke Zarathustra\u003c/i\u003e, so there was an evident familiarity and respect of Nietzsche on the part of the composer. In \u003ci\u003eOn the Genealogy of Morality\u003c/i\u003e, Nietzsche calls into question the righteousness of the ascetic ideal. He discards this aspiration for being one of repression and inaction. The initial championing of John’s purity turns to contempt when considered under a Nietzschean lens. He lives his life as a slave to his morals, guided by something outside of himself—something that doesn’t exist. Instead, the apparently superficial obsession of Salome turns to sacrament. She overlooks the content of the prophet’s words, transfixed on his skin, hair, and lips, because his words convey nothing. They are the non-referring and empty utterances of a man disposed to inaction. What Salome loves in John the Baptist is the chastity she loves within herself. But chastity here is the regurgitated symbol of repression and inaction. Thus, Salome too falls slave to the unachievable nonexistent.\u003c/p\u003e",

This is the second travel ban Trump has issued to be struck down by the courts. The first was struck down because it broke Section 1152(a) of Title 8 of the U.S. Code, which states, “No person shall receive any preference or priority or be discriminated against in the issuance of an immigrant visa because of the person’s race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence.” The new travel ban was constructed specifically to hold up against similar legal challenges. Unlike the old ban, this one does not apply to green card holders. It also does not discriminate based on religion, since it does not include any preference towards accepting Christians facing religious persecution, and it ignores Islam and any specific religion altogether. What is left is a policy no different than President Obama’s 2011 order that suspended Iraqi refugees for six months and President Carter’s 1980 ban on Iranian visa holders. Since these two orders were clearly constitutional, Trump’s order should be treated no differently. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRather than upholding the law established through the U.S. Legal Code and precedent, the judges decided to legislate from the bench, using their power to state that the order was unconstitutional because they did not like Trump’s policy. They did so by incorrectly stating that implied motivation is just as important in determining constitutionality as the text in the law. The court used a statement from last year, when Trump said on the campaign trail, “I think Islam hates us,” to say that the ban is motivated by the desire to limit the number of Muslims entering the country. While this may be true, when judging the order, all that must be taken into account is the text, since it is the text that would be enforced and not the motivation, and the text states that the purpose of the travel ban is to prevent immigration from countries that import terrorism until a better vetting system for refugees can be implemented. A court’s job is not to legislate from the bench, but to interpret the law, and the Ninth Circuit failed at its job.\u003c/p\u003e",

I have been a fan of \n\nJosé González\n\n for quite some time now, but I had never even heard of The \n\nGöteborg\n\n String Theory. I’m so glad I went, however, because The \n\nGöteborg\n\n String Theory added a super interesting and surprising dimension to González\n\n’s acoustic songs. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost songs began softly, focusing on a certain area of TGST’s instrumentation. Sometimes percussion would bellow, other times violins would swell up. \n\nGonzález \n\nwould enter about a third through the song, piercing the symphony sweetly with his vibrato-less voice. A key focal point of the show was towards the back of the stage - some of the percussion used was very experimental, straying from rhythmic normalcy and traditional instruments. There were occasional solos from different pockets of the orchestra, adding texture to the performance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough I thought that I would crave for \n\nGonzález to do his songs alone, I actually really loved, and maybe even preferred, TGST’s contribution to his work. They made otherwise simple songs feel intricate and emotionally complex. The extravagance of added instrumentation, however, stripped \n\nGonzález’s songs of the intimacy they possessed in his recordings. Despite this step away from his personal emotion, I felt that the orchestra added an element to the songs that made them more personal and applicable to any individual audience member. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\nGonzález \n\n was calm, somewhat shy, and very focused. He rarely made comments and didn’t create much of a connection with the audience. I didn’t dislike this - I’m sure it was a stylistic choice - but I would have really enjoyed learning more about the process he used when collaborating with TGST, or just about him in general. I actually felt more drawn to the conductor, one of the most youthful and energetic I have ever seen, using his whole body to let the beat pulse through him. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe arrangements that were played in the show were dramatic and interesting, but as much as I enjoyed them, I really wish that there was a visual element that would have rounded out the performance. Some sort of set, projection, or light show would have added an element of theatricality and would have made the night at Royce Hall much more of an all-encompassing experience. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI left the hall with the type of elation that usually fills my body after seeing a really good show. Everything except for the past two hours was erased from my mind. I walked home refreshed and really happy. There were some things I may have changed about the show, but I feel this way about most shows, so I would have to give my night at Royce Hall a solid 8 out of 10.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\nThanks to CAP UCLA for a really unique show, and for that \u003ci\u003eclutch\u003c/i\u003e student discount!\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

A couple bell hits spice up the beat on the hook yet the hook itself feels like Future is simply compromising. In fact, there are many times where Future does the bare minimum to convince his audience that he is anything else but leaned out on the microphone. In retrospect, the production on “Zoom” gave the impression that Future was going to vocalize something that would be memorable or quotable. The incessant repetition of “ran it up fast” hammers away along with the beat; while tough, cold and merciless at first, it becomes stale upon the second and third listens. The track ends with an ill-meant diss at Desiigner. I personally enjoy the deviation and, quite frankly, Desiigner has earned these shots. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the better tracks on the entire 17 piece meal is arguably “Draco.” The track’s synth arpeggios, warm 808 bass, thick snare, and Future’s versatility all come together fairly nicely. Some might find the synth somewhat harsh and abrasive, but it eventually falls into the background when Future makes his appearance. “Super Trapper” is meant to be a thuggish, darkly tinted track but it comes off as, once again, an uninteresting display of flexing money, drugs, and Future’s come up. “POA” is more upbeat, and manages to barely convey the dark feelings that “Super Trapper” meant to. If anything the production of “POA” might make it worthy of a third or fourth play, but the hook and verses that Future provide here are relatively tame. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Mask Off” is similar to “POA,” and the flutes that are sampled throughout the track are welcoming and eerie. Yet, once again, Future fails to provide something of substance. It is important to note that this is being held to Future’s own standards that he set on DS2. Nobody comes to Future expecting bars or songs of personal substance; however the self titled record gives off the impression that most of these tracks might be leftovers of previous bodies of work. “Outta Time” is an enjoyable change of pace, where Future plays a more melodic role on his album. The hook is delicious - “P.I.M.P., gettin\u0026rsquo; that Monica Lewinsky / Chain on freeze, wrist on jet-skis.” The beat, also crafted by Southside, is riddled with wah-wah synth strokes and small, angular guitar notes. The track as a whole gives off a carefree, sunny feeling - a context that Future would usually not be found on. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSubsequent tracks fall into the aforementioned slump that Future carved for himself. “I’m so Groovy” contains a poor replication of Young Thug on it. “Might as Well” contains a Drake-y beat: minimal with piano hits, a sine bass, and small amounts of reverb thrown in. “Poppin Tags” is a track that Future listeners could swear they have heard before. From the construction of the beat to the lyrical content to the actual delivery that Future provides, this track feels like some kind of B-side. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Flip” is a track that gives the impression that a feature would have made this extremely replay worthy. The hook could use a bit of focus, as Future appears to be jumping from note to note without any idea of what the final product should be. In fact, most of this record feels very directionless despite the sensation that most tracks blend seamlessly with one another. The fact that the whole record is reserved for Future could add to that specific detriment. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe hoover synth on “When I Was Broke” makes the beat stand out from the rest of the skeletal trap beats. It wobbles under Future throughout the majority of the track and adds a secondary melodic edge. As a closing track, “Feds Did a Sweep” is humbling and sweet. The production brought together by Zaytoven feels like it would be a track that could use Gucci, or somebody, on it. Future made a very interesting decision keeping the entire project to himself, but it is a shame that this same interesting decision did not lead to a collection of interesting tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRating: 5/10\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eFavorite tracks:\u003c/b\u003e “Rent Money,” “Outta Time”\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "4 Political Podcasts for the Trump Era // UCLA Radio News",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By: Shivali Gowda\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date: 4/16/17 \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 2016 election was a big catalyst for the podcast industry. Because more people are engaged than ever in the current political climate, podcasts are a way to get the news through an in-depth discussion. The problem I’ve had with getting news in the past is that, if you’re busy for one week and don’t have time to keep up, there’s no way to learn what is happening from the beginning. By that time, the news has usually progressed to analysis about the analysis. Some websites seek to fix this problem, like Vox, with explainers. But one thing podcasts particularly do is give you more context to the event that’s happening. Because many of them only tape once a week, it is a good recap on what is happening, how it happened, and where it is going, all for an hour or so of your time. I was among the many people who started listening to podcasts because of the 2016 election. Because of this I wanted to review and recommend a few political podcasts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e1. The Weeds\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis podcast is hosted by Vox’s Ezra Klein, Matt Yglesias, and Sarah Kliff. This is my favorite podcast by far because the hosts are very knowledgeable about the policy details they talk about. Kliff specifically is one of the most informed political reporters on healthcare and it is enlightening to listen to on why the Republican healthcare plan was flawed and what is wrong with Obamacare and possible avenues to fix it. This podcast is great if you want to understand policies instead of simply listening to your weekly news. Their views are liberal, as Vox generally is, but they are not hyper-partisan and analyze policies on a fact basis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e2. Slate Political Gabfest\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis one is almost tied with The Weeds for my favorite podcast for a variety of reasons. The first is that the hosts are not afraid to disagree with one another. It is hosted by Emily Bazelon (writer for the \u003ci\u003eNew York Times Magazine\u003c/i\u003e), David Plotz (CEO of Atlas Obscura and former editor of Slate), and John Dickerson (host of “Face the Nation”). Bazelon and Plotz get in arguments about various issues, from trusting police to Supreme Court cases. The arguments are constructive and even though I find myself usually agreeing with Bazelon, it is interesting to see the other side of the argument pointed out by someone who is also left-leaning. I also like this podcast because they provide perspective outside of the immediate time of an event. Dickerson brings up many historical parallels that are useful in understanding context. Their podcast is also one of the oldest political podcasts, starting back in 2005. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e3. Pod Save America\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis was one of the first political podcasts I began listening to during the 2016 election. I really liked the discussions between former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau and former Obama Senior Advisor Dan Pfeiffer when the show began, and when former Obama speechwriter Jon Lovett came on as a guest, I really wanted him to host the show with the other two. Eventually, they created two shows: one with Favreau and Pfeiffer, and the other with Favreau, Lovett, and Tommy Vietor, former Obama NSC Spokesman. The hosts have great chemistry, they are really funny, and they provide an inside perspective. However, they have since become their own company, Crooked Media, and begun to do more podcasts more often, and although I love their content, it makes me uncomfortable that they are “cashing in” on Trump’s election and that their discussions generally take place within the context of the two or three days of news they’re covering. However, I would still recommend this podcast, especially for people who are looking to become more active in politics, whether it’s through protesting or calling your congressman.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e4. 538’s Election Podcast\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis podcast is fun and nerdy. The host is Jody Avirgan, who is a professional in the audio space, and he talks to Nate Silver, Harry Enten, and Clare Malone. They have great conversations about polls and stats about current events. The humorous banter also makes it a great listen and they bring on informed guests to talk about specific news items, like the power of protests. I like that they bring a lot of news down to the numbers, as it provides a different perspective from general political podcasts.\u003c/p\u003e",

Some children had “the talk” at young ages at some procrastinated time before the pot roast was ready. They squirmed in their seats and fidgeted uncontrollably at the thought of private parts. But It wasn’t until seeing the voluptuous curves of the red satin dress on Ms. Jessica that they could conceptualize the birds and the bees. Upon first sight, Jessica Rabbit gave rise to their first epiphany - children’s first lusts and dirty imaginations. Jessica Rabbit embodied everything that men wanted to conquer, and what women wanted to be. Mysterious. Hair flips. She glistens in my memory. Of course she didn’t dress up for Halloween.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wonder if Jessica Rabbit would be proud to know that she came alive on the stage of the El Rey on April 4. The crowd lined up to see the personified version of Jessica Rabbit in the human form of Alina Baraz an hour early. The energy was anxious for a Tuesday, and even the solo guys whose dates had abandoned them at the bar seemed content with themselves. The merch line was longer than the bathroom and bar line combined. “I don’t even like this jean jacket… but if I spend the $200 on it, I can meet Alina after the show!” a girl squealed to her friend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBaraz’s fan base, a surprisingly diverse crowd of tweens and mid 30-something aged ladies with Yeezys, soul, and no regard to a curfew swayed to the opener. The top 40 music DJ pumped up the crowd, and as the room filled with more people, it became clear: this Tuesday night show had been marked on the calendars of every person west of the 405 for months.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe lights on the stage appeared slowly. Dimly lit in gold fluorescents, Baraz’s shadowy figure came to center stage. Like waking from a dream, her full figure took shape on stage in a blurry motion of disbelief and awe. Baraz’s perfect pitch filled the room and the crowd stood still for a minute. Playing songs from the \u003ci\u003eUrban Flora\u003c/i\u003e EP, Baraz didn’t talk to the audience between any breaks as she played “Show Me,” “Make you Feel,” and “Maybe.” I closed my eyes and wondered how she had gotten to this point. Her voice has the right tone to be played in a fancy airport lounge or the winding-down hours of a wedding reception. As the rest of her show went on, it became apparent that she wasn’t accustomed to vocal strain, and in certain parts, found her higher notes to be cut short with deeper breaths. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"853\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/476ea50787e985722f16f3bc46187276/tumblr_inline_ooc09hdlp81qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"853\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhoto by Alex McDonell\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMidway through the set, Baraz smiled at the crowd. “I have a new song that I’ve never played before. Do you guys want to hear?” The remaining 20 minutes were the best of the show, keeping the crowd on the dance floor and away from the bathroom line. “I want to introduce you to someone… one of my great friends.” \u003ca href=\"http://uclaradio.tumblr.com/post/159281673812/american-teen-khalid-album-review\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKhalid\u003c/a\u003e took to the stage and they both jumped in to their song together, “Electric,” singing, “Darker than the ocean, deeper than the sea/You\u0026rsquo;ve got everything, you got what I need/Touch me, you\u0026rsquo;re electric, babe.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBaraz and Khalid exemplified seventh grade chemistry, where crushes developed in the notes passed between sweaty fingers and puppy love dreams. They turned and sang to each other, holding each other\u0026rsquo;s hands as they harmonized and created a moment. It felt awkwardly invasive to be in the crowd watching them together as they locked eyes and sang lusty sweet-nothings to each other.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"614\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8f1c571d16bb45d38d5173afcca6fc90/tumblr_inline_ooc0atj1491qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"614\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhoto by Andrew Gomez\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKhalid gave a slight bow to the audience as the song ended, and Baraz transitioned seamlessly into two more songs. The crowd, hot and bothered by now, reflected the image of Roger Rabbit\u0026rsquo;s tongue hitting the ground with eyes shooting like daggers towards the stage. If we had tails, they would have wagged. As she brought our repressed notions of lust to life, Baraz read the audience and saved the best song for last, playing the popular “Fantasy” - the one fantasy we’d been hoping for.  No DJ could remix the fantasy Baraz could conjure, and no Jessica Rabbit would ever compare.\u003c/p\u003e",

In an effort to eliminate the smog problem caused by greenhouse gas emissions, California has vowed to enforce tougher regulations on vehicle companies. These regulations include making automakers produce energy-efficient engines, utilize eco-friendly materials, and build more electric cars.These regulations seem ideal, but concerns with President Trump’s administration may arise due to Trump’s strongheld denial of climate change. California’s long history with pollution battles has fostered a strong feeling of resistance between the state and the federal government on the topic of regulations regarding to pollution. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to the \u003ci\u003eLos Angeles Times\u003c/i\u003e, President George W. Bush’s administration declined a waiver request from California to enforce air pollution regulations in 2002. Conversely, when President Obama took office, this waiver was granted to the state and sparked efforts to establish a national policy on greenhouse gas emissions. Although Trump’s conservative administration intends to halt regulations on air pollution, the state is prepared to fire back and strongly negotiate for the regulations. These efforts are significant for California\u0026rsquo;s smog epidemic, since the health and quality of life of many Californians are adversely affected by the pollution. Detrimental health effects, including airborne diseases, have increasingly affected Californians from dense industrialized areas due to high greenhouse emissions. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is time to enforce stronger regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, in order to ensure a healthy and clean environment for all Californians. In order to complete this promise, we must all work together to bring about a change.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Re: “Make No Mistake, Trump Will Build That Wall on the Mexican Border” // UCLA Radio News",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By: Sydney Matthews\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date: 4/3/17\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBuilding a stronger border is inefficient because funding will be sought in American pockets. Trump proposing a “border tax” on Mexican imports is ineffective because the Mexican government knows Trump’s intentions of making Mexico pay for the southern border. Therefore,  they would not fund their own segregation from America. This means funds must generated elsewhere.The payment would be left in American hands. Intensifying borders would initially remove, according to Grieco and Ray, “13 percent of economy (immigrant labor workers).” The result would be a disturbance in the secured flow of income, disrupting in government programs and innovation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eForemost, with the Republican Party already enacting tax cuts and the remainder of the tax investment being transmitted into strengthening the Mexican border, it minimizes government funded programs; it would cut back on after school programs for middle and low income students, public healthcare, and other essentials middle and lower class need to fully function. Essentially, by redirecting tax investment to fund empty hate, it takes away programs needed to enable an individual’s prosperity. On a broader scope, hindering innovation hinders society’s ability to remain competitive with other countries.The freedom of innovation is threatened, thus taking away one’s resources and tools needed to be innovative and leaving them no space for creativity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s essential also to raise awareness around the issue of inflicting stronger borders because it contradicts American values. For one, it ceases one\u0026rsquo;s natural right of movement, as stated in the Constitution, and also dehumanizes foreigners, which contradicts the Declaration of Independence and that “all men were created equal.” With stronger borders, stronger border patrol is neede as well . Unfortunately, this demented disposition about foreigners primes officer’s associations of who belongs and does not. Therefore, through the procedure of carrying out an order, immigrants are dehumanized to targets and are ostracized from society. This disassociation becomes the foundation that drives officials to feel compelled and disconcerted with foreign murder and destruction in hopes of securing the border and protecting residents. Detachment through “stronger borders” becomes normalized within America and further feeds the segregation and polarity between Americans and foreign born. Long term effects of isolation restrict foreign resources and foreign aid utilized in times of national crisis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\nIn order to sustain efficient allocation of economic energy, the answer lies in diversifying the labor in economy, not exclusion. For instance, according to the New Economic of Labor Migration theory, fully functioning markets are not always applicable, therefore diversifying labor, and individuals can act collectively as a social unit to maximize income for the economy as a whole.\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRead the original op-ed \u003ca href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/06/trumps-border-wall-with-mexico-will-happen.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "The Battleground of Social Media // UCLA Radio News",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By: Helen Lee\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date: 3/30/17\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDeep-rooted, anachronistic, closed-minded points of view met progressive, social technology in advent of Donald Trump’s controversial presidential campaign. Not only did Donald Trump, as a presidential candidate, gain a reputation for being controversially effusive, but his vocal, animate, and hateful supporters also gained a huge presence on mainstream social media websites such as Twitter, Facebook, and even Reddit. These extremist points of view echoing themes of white supremacy gained traction and support by many who were dissatisfied with the liberal status quo with President Obama. In such cases, uprisings and social media campaigns were employed by both ends of the spectrum, in which progressive people of color fought to make equality matter. Such is shown in the 2015 case of the murder of Michael Brown by police officers, when social and political activists fought to make race relations and perceptions matter by creating huge campaigns centered around Twitter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the extremist right wing perspective, echo-chambers of backwards thought were created amongst the emerging alt-right. ‘Alt-right’ is a term that refers to the alternative right, a loose group of people with far-right ideologies who reject mainstream conservatism in the United States. These groups that oppose immigration and political correctness, such as neo-Nazis and white nationalists, have grown exponentially in the recent years, only to be heightened by the ascent of Donald Trump. Major American white nationalist movements on Twitter have gained about 22,000 followers since 2012, and referenced Trump in tweets more than any other topic. Likewise, the most commonly used hashtag of these groups was found to be “#whitegenocide” after it was found that Trump had referenced a user with the username of ‘White Genocide.’ While racism and colorism were not the only issues that these extremist groups referenced, it was a large focus. Issues of immigration and abortion, although arguably equally controversial, did not gain nearly as much traction on social media as issues of race and white supremacy. These mainstream platforms soon became ground for white-power groups to foster discussion about race, rally support for Trump, and grow their following. This shows that social media, while progressive, has the power and the potential to be used for the wrong purposes, and set progressive thought behind by using the same medium to infiltrate toxic ideas. For instance, white supremacy groups have used Reddit to contribute to “WhiteRights” subreddits, and even Google searched for “Martin Luther King,” leads to a white supremacy website titled \u003ca href=\"https://share.polymail.io/v1/z/b/NThjYzc5ZDQ1NDVj/kvwU60spy5Ys3EEVjiG9ibKT4WZEacgvFr16AsZC27QeihnzmbcVJJvfQeCQTlgqvmE8rzZcUo0VoQ5-cIGvt8DzQOkfeUQJjVFDzMc7owNyEsqKZT5c9ZDJ46KXTCgTD_aDam53_yxO7-bdKBIkjM53VozvobpCA8gbdnibQ4HeTxamaLgPbDltYvxm7_rMXXRToOQDvi_A\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMartinLutherKing.org\u003c/a\u003e, which paints the civil-rights leader as a fraud.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the opposite end of the spectrum, few individuals have sparked campaigns of support for racial equality. Specifically in the case of the murder of Michael Brown, they found a voice on social media to comment on the news, describe their personal experiences and relate the everyday struggles of blacks in America. These activists used Twitter, Tumblr, and even Facebook as mediums to mobilize and raise awareness of the racial injustices and discriminatory police violence. Three key voices in this campaign, Johnetta Elzie, DeRay Mckesson, and Zellie Imani, mobilized online by taking pictures and videos and hashtagging, in efforts to document the horrific treatment and spread the word. The nature of the visual content was able to carry much further and garner the support of thousands of social media users nationally and internationally. Mckesson and a core group of other activists have built the most formidable American protest movement of the 21st century to date \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn critical analysis, social media can be used and manipulated by different populations. People and political groups have agendas, while social media platforms do not. In the two different cases of both liberal and conservative-alt-right movements, it is clearly delineated that it is the people of these groups that create the content and the movements with the message that they spread. These very polarized intentions often clash and create larger conflicts of “good vs. bad” ideals and “right vs. wrong” ideals.\u003c/p\u003e",

More than forty members have passed through the BJM in a repeatedly changing lineup, with Newcombe as the single member contributing to each album. Given Newcombe supposedly plays more than eighty instruments and has been known to be unapologetically honest (ex. kicking members of the band off stage mid-set if displeased with their performances and physically haggling the audience during shows), fans have come to expect innovation as a result of his talent and candor tendencies from the Brian Jonestown Massacre. The BJM’s most recent release, \u003ci\u003eDon’t Get Lost\u003c/i\u003e, is distinctly more psychedelic than the band’s previous records. While somewhat distracting, the eclectic arrangement of \u003ci\u003eDon’t Get Lost \u003c/i\u003eonly further proves the BJM’s (and specifically Newcombe’s) expansive and versatile abilities in creating music. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerhaps better suited as the basis for a series of albums, each song is markedly different from the others, ranging from ambient to reggae to electronic. At seventy two minutes, the album is extensive and somewhat exhausting to listen to in full, yet provides an intricate soundscape impossible to disregard as inappreciable. One of the more enticing aspects of the album is its reformulation of older sounds. Groovy bass lines, echoey vocals, and trance jazz are featured throughout the album, with guest vocals featuring Tim Burgess, Tess Parks, Shaun Rivers, and Freiderike Binert. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\nWhile it is fair to assume that the album has been rethought and strategically constructed with Newcombe’s perfectionist tendencies, \u003ci\u003eDon’t Get Lost \u003c/i\u003efeels refreshingly raw and unapologetic. Approaching twenty albums since its formation in 1990, there is no end in sight for the Brian Jonestown Massacre as Newcombe seems to have not faltered in his pace of production over the years, continuing to build a collection of music almost unrivaled in its consistently of greatness.\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

These singles are the closest we get to the sound of older Why? albums, as \u003ci\u003eMoh Lhean\u003c/i\u003e moves into gentler sounds as the album moves forward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile on the surface \u003ci\u003eMoh Lhean \u003c/i\u003edoes not possess as “weird” a sound as earlier Why? albums, songs that begin with gentle piano and guitar melodies eventually spur out into weirder, weightier sounds through layering of instrumentals and vocals. Similarly to older albums, Wolf incorporates whistling, xylophones, recorded conversations, and wistful, echoing female vocals, providing a depth to tracks that may seem lackluster in comparison to his earlier heavier, percussion-centric work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWolf’s lyrics continue to be well-crafted, although they perhaps become more ambiguous in a darker way as he subtly focuses on themes of death, which are especially poignant considering the softer sound he has switched to in \u003ci\u003eMoh Lhean\u003c/i\u003e. In “Proactive Evolution,” Wolf compares himself to, “The negative of the silhouette/Of a dock crane backlit at sunset/Gasping for exit through unknown air.” In “One Mississippi,” he sings, “Constantly rising from/And falling into flame/My body knows more than/I can form with my brain.” These vague, dark images are scattered throughout the album, and come in strong contrast to the soft piano melodies and chimes accompanying them. However, the optimistic undertones of the album are also occasionally present in the lyrics like, “A new love blooms on the long notes of old horns,” from “George Washington.” Ultimately, it is this cryptic tone that proves \u003ci\u003eMoh Lhean\u003c/i\u003e to be an especially personal album for Wolf, perhaps proven further by the title being a reference that Why? refuses to expand on— as made evident by Joyful Noise stating, “Don\u0026rsquo;t bother asking Wolf what ‘Moh Lhean’ means. He won\u0026rsquo;t tell you.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eMoh Lhean \u003c/i\u003ekeeps the piano-focused melodies from earlier Why? albums like \u003ci\u003eElephant Eyelash\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eMumps, Etc.\u003c/i\u003e “Proactive Evolution,” however, is the most we’ll hear of Wolf’s characteristic nasal, half-spoken delivery, as the album focuses more and more on more on his melodic singing in “Easy,” “Consequence of Nonaction,” and the soul-influenced “George Washington.” Perhaps it is this shift to a more mellow sound that has left many to describe the album as being underwhelming in comparison to earlier Why? albums, that were acclaimed for their weirdness both in lyrical content and instrumental experimentation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis criticism is, in many ways, valid. Upon first listen, many of the tracks on \u003ci\u003eMoh Lhean\u003c/i\u003e seem to blend together. Even as a long-time Why? fan, I was disappointed in \u003ci\u003eMoh Lhean\u003c/i\u003e upon the first listen, expecting the same unabashed weirdness I had appreciated from Why? in albums like \u003ci\u003eAlopecia\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eElephant Eyelash\u003c/i\u003e. It took multiple listens for me to appreciate this “softer” and more mature Why?, now less focused on danceable drum beats and outright eccentric lyrics. This raises the question of whether established Why? fans are willing to overlook their expectations of the band as a solely experimental group, and whether new listeners will be willing to appreciate a more mellow Why? off the bat, even if it means having to listen to the album multiple times to truly appreciate all the album has to offer, in terms of lyrical content and crafted instrumentals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite this, the album is ultimately worth a listen, whether it’s a chance for old-time Why? fans to see the new direction Wolf is taking the project, or a softer introduction for new listeners to become acquainted with Wolf’s work. What may seem underwhelming upon first listen \u003ci\u003eMoh Lhean\u003c/i\u003e ultimately makes up for with a more subtle intelligence in presenting its message and perspective on a personal peace with death. Ultimately, it presents something much deeper than many other Why? albums, and its vague, lyrical impressions on life accompanied by orchestral precision are not to be overlooked or overshadowed by the band’s older work.\u003c/p\u003e",

The two-hour long \u003ci\u003eCommon as Light and Love are Red Valleys of Blood\u003c/i\u003e, however, goes beyond the stereotypical folk niche Kozelek has been known for in the past, as he comments on the current political climate and incorporates musical elements once foreign to Kozelek’s expected folk sound.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe album begins with the nostalgic “God Bless Ohio,” with a reminiscent Kozelek singing, “Domino’s pizza brings me back to when I was younger, when I was younger, when I was younger,” over a strong baseline and a clumsily fingered guitar melody. Kozelek reflects on how “the power of song” brings him healing and a home - initiating the small midwestern town aesthetic Kozelek’s music is known for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis mood continues until “Philadelphia Cop,” when the album switches direction as Kozelek begins to incorporate newer, less guitar-centric sounds, and reveals his unapologetic distaste of modern millennial culture with, “See I don’t give a fuck about things like who’s the best or the worst on Twitter.” His disassociation from this culture is made evident by the repetition of “I ain’t no one’s fucking puppet.” Kozelek goes as far as to poke fun at the current youth music scene with a mock conversation between a music journalist and stereotypical festival-goer:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e“Oh my god, you get to meet the bands?”\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e“Yeah, totally. I\u0026rsquo;m friends with Jim James, Dr. John Misty, a bunch of people. \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e*notification sound* \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eHold on a second,  Sufjan Stevens just texted me right now.\u0026ldquo;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKozelek continues to remark on his stance on current societal issues, including the transgender bathroom bill debate and the election of President Donald Trump in “Lone Star,” gun control in “Bergen to Trondheim,” and the crisis in Syria in “Vague Rock Song.” Ultimately this rambling commentary is nothing new for Kozelek, as it establishes the personal connection he has with the listener, not withholding any part of his train-of-thought ranting. \u003ci\u003eCommon as Light\u003c/i\u003e differs from earlier Sun Kil Moon and Red House Painters albums, however, as we see a more biting, caustic side of Kozelek.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLyrics aside, \u003ci\u003eCommon as Light \u003c/i\u003ealso deviates from other Sun Kil Moon albums instrumentally as Kozelek begins to incorporate synthesizers, minimalist melodies, and subtle hip-hop influences, which come completely out of left-field when considering Kozelek’s other mellow, guitar-centric projects and prior work under Sun Kil Moon. Besides the use of synthesizers throughout the album and the deviation from the guitar melodies Kozelek focused on in earlier projects, the experimentation in \u003ci\u003eCommon as Light \u003c/i\u003eis made most evident in “Vague Rock Song.” Kozelek himself light-heartedly addresses this change in sound in the track, as he begins with a simple and stated “vague” tune, which is interjected with a Zappa reference and Afro-pop inspired break. Through \u003ci\u003eCommon as Light\u003c/i\u003e, Kozelek surely proves that his musical abilities are certainly able to push boundaries and keep up with modern experimentation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile it may seem like an overly bitter, out-of-touch Kozelek ranting about his hatred for iPhones, Twitter, and current American politics, \u003ci\u003eCommon as Light\u003c/i\u003e still serves as an entirely unapologetic reflection of the issues being debated within our society, and is refreshing in an at times sugar-coated, media-dominated, censored world. His critique of what modern society has turned into is poignantly stated, bitter, and biting, and while many listeners have taken this as Kozelek being caught up in his own mind, the album ultimately serves as a brilliant satirical piece, proving Kozelek’s self-awareness, as well as his ability to not stray from the unconventional, both in his instrumentals and lyrical content.\u003c/p\u003e",

The show welcomes listeners of all identities to hear the conversation about the intersection of queerness and music. Their show has featured visitors such as musician Angelina Savanna, but both DJs were certain to name their favorite guest - their current intern Bianca.

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWritten By: Alexa Lee, Digital Press\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1024\" data-orig-width=\"788\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/afea4091619140ae3ca7b15e9d0ac761/tumblr_inline_oojexuz3OF1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1024\" data-orig-width=\"788\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWaiting to get into CSU Northridge’s auditorium, I watch a security woman place my phone in what looks like a lime green felt sock, seal said sock with my phone shut inside, then hand it back to me, saying that I will be able to access my phone after the concert has ended. I leave her and head inside the concert hall, trying to see if I can break my phone out of its new container. I cannot.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Tonight’s event is the second stop in Cage the Elephant’s “Live \u0026amp; Unpeeled: The Acoustic Tour.” As the tour’s title suggests, the show will feature acoustic versions of the band’s music and create a stripped down, more intimate atmosphere. Apparently, part of building this atmosphere of intimacy is enforcing a technology free zone. I find my seat and join the rest of the audience, a crowd of people now obliged to converse with each other because none of us can check our phones.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Eventually, the lights dim down and the curtain rises, and it’s Cage the Elephant. The stage is largely bare, with the band members sitting on barstools alongside a string quartet. In the background are a row of lamps that have been adorned with flowers. Though minimally decorated, it’s almost funny to see Cage the Elephant’s stage set-up juxtaposed with the rest of the Valley Performing Arts Center, whose stage I imagine is usually used for events like school plays and academic awards nights instead of rock concerts. I don’t think about this for too long however, because soon there’s a slamming of chords and the kick of the drumbeat and the show has begun. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe opening song is “Sweetie Little Jean,” and lead singer Matt Shultz’s voice shocks me with it’s clarity and beauty. It is powerful but still melodic, melancholy but not whiny. This is my first time seeing the band live, and they sound even better than they do on their LPs. After this first song, Shultz faces the crowd and smiles. “Hey, we’re Cage the Elephant, and tonight’s going to be a little different, is that okay?” The audience roars.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e As the show progresses, I realize that the venue is perhaps a better fit for the show than I originally thought. Cage the Elephant’s presence is both theatrically exhilarating and honestly raw, an emotionally potent show that belongs in a concert hall. The band delivers charged performances of “Punchin’ Bag” and “Spiderhead,” and I stand to my feet with the rest of the crowd, awestruck. Shultz is bedecked in a gauzy scarf, snug red cardigan and bright red blazer that looks like it once belonged to Hillary Clinton. He runs back and forth across the stage and bursts into fits of dancing. He moves wildly but with conviction. He moves not in a leisurely dance, and instead moves as if he has to or he’ll go insane trying to stay still. Even when he is sitting down, as he does for gentler tracks like “Telescope,” I can see him leaning forward emphatically and occasionally jumping out of his seat in a moment of passion. Meanwhile, guitarist Brad Shultz and bassist Daniel Tichenor calmly strum their instruments, sipping water slowly in between songs. Lead guitar Nick Bockrath can be caught smiling to himself now and again, as though he also cannot believe how great the night is unfolding.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Ain’t No Rest for the Wicked,” “Cigarette Daydreams,” and “Back Against the Wall” are incredible, and they bring the house down. I doubt there is a Cage the Elephant show review in existence that hasn’t said this about these songs, but I mention it anyway because it’s true. I marvel at how Shultz delivers these hits as expressively as he does, singing “Ain’t No Rest for the Wicked” as if it’s his first performance of the song and not his thousandth. Other memorable songs are “Hypocrite” and a cover of Wreckless Eric’s “Whole Wide World,” which sounds unusually groovy for a band so prone to an intense, even raucous, sound.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe band transitions to slower songs now, and a stillness unfurls across the stage. Clean and sorrowful guitar notes mark the beginning of “How Are You True,” supplemented later on by the quartet’s violins. The lights dim down and cascade onto Shultz, bathing him in soft, unreal light. “Trouble” is next, then “Shake Me Down,” whose crescendo in the chorus feels mournful despite the crowd cheering and jumping along to the rhythm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCage the Elephant tries to conclude with “Come a Little Closer,” but when they exit the audience stays, applauding and calling out for an encore. Only Shultz comes back, first picking up a guitar then abruptly setting it back down. He breaks out into an a cappella ballad that I do not recognize. He sounds clear and a little undone. Standing slouched in his little red blazer, I think he is glowing. He finishes the song, waves, and walks off stage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe lights in the auditorium come on, and the audience staggers to the exits. Watching the concert had felt like being transported to another world, and it was a little odd to suddenly be back in Northridge, searching through my bag for the green pouch holding my phone. I get my phone unlocked and leave the venue. I drive home. Already I wish I was back, listening to the bass and the strings and that single, clear voice singing, “I’ll keep my eyes fixed on the sun.”\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By: Alexa Lee\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date: 4/10/17\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter approximately a year and a half long hiatus since the show’s season two finale, the season three premiere of \u003ci\u003eRick and Morty\u003c/i\u003e aired in a surprise release on Adult Swim’s website this past April Fool’s Day. The episode streamed on repeat for several hours throughout the day (Though this looped streaming stopped at the end of April Fool’s Day, currently Adult Swim is streaming every episode of \u003ci\u003eRick and Morty \u003c/i\u003eincluding the season three premiere, so “The Rickshank Redemption” can still be viewed with a little bit of careful timing.) Given the lengthy wait and cliffhanger ending from the penultimate episode, to say that the expectations for this episode were high is to understate the fervent anticipation of the show’s fan following. For fans of \u003ci\u003eRick and Morty\u003c/i\u003e, the expectations were exceptionally, extraordinarily high. Thus, it is all the more impressive how well “The Rickshank Redemption” lives up to its hype, delivering humor, character insight, and wild visual aesthetic without any compromise to the movement of the plot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u0009From this point onward, this review will contain episode spoilers. Look out!\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The Rickshank Redemption” features an escape from intergalactic prison, the toppling of an alien government colonizing Earth, and a divorce - and that’s only what happened in Universe C137, Rick and Morty’s home universe. The episode is fast-paced action, making it all the more impressive when the visual images do justice to the storyline. As Rick tumbles first through the world in his mind, then to the Council of Ricks headquarters, and finally the Galactic Federation, the audience is privy to stunning animation that bring to life each and every different world \u003ci\u003eRick and Morty \u003c/i\u003ehas ever imagined. Accompanying these colorful illustrations is hilarious dialogue. Creators Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland incorporate acerbic criticisms of the banalities of people into the show’s characters (i.e. Jerry’s cowardice when he says, “I’m not proud to share this, but I just kept crawling and it kept working,” and Rick’s mania when he says, “I want that Mulan McNugget sauce, Morty! That’s my series arc, if it takes nine more seasons Morty!”) and the result is brilliant, and often self-deprecating, comedy. And of course, this clever dialogue is supplemented with less clever, but still rewarding humor such as references to alien dick and a planet known as ‘Butt World.’\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeneath the butt humor and slapstick jokes about insectoid aliens, one of the most engaging parts about “The Rickshank Redemption” is its real emotional depth. The episode highlights Morty and Summer’s devotion to their grandfather, which grows complicated as they grapple with Rick’s blatant disregard for other people. Viewers receive a glimpse into Beth’s dependency on her father, and how she navigates her marriage amidst fears of abandonment and her husband’s distaste for her hero Rick. And, most of all, this episode hints at the ambiguous motivations of Rick himself that simmer underneath his callous bravado. Rick consistently undermines his own random acts of compassion by claiming he did them for self-serving reasons. He manipulates his daughter and repeatedly threatens his grandson Morty. Additionally, Rick’s instances of vulnerability are juxtaposed with the show’s plethora of bawdy humor and spectacular supernatural events so that Rick’s true character remains nebulous; for example, after extensive buildup, the backstory of the death of Rick’s wife in this episode prove to be nothing more than a farcical set-up by Rick. However, hints at Rick’s self-loathing and mysterious past imply that his selfish insensitivity is not authentic, but rather a veneer he wears to mask both his affinity for his family and a deep-seated unhappiness with himself. Rick as a character cannot be immediately understood as merely a crass old man, or even as a space traveling mad scientist. Rick’s personal complexity creates a compelling emotional pull, and brings a somber yet more intriguing dimension to the show’s comedy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\nIn short, the season three premiere of \u003ci\u003eRick and Morty\u003c/i\u003e is simultaneously a giant adventure, a joke, and a subtle portrayal of the inner demons of a broken man. “The Rickshank Redemption” wraps up the season two cliff hanger virtually seamlessly and with an abundance of humor, while leaving much to explore in the following episodes. I look forward to see what the rest of season three has to offer.\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Or maybe you’re more of a free-spirit and crave songs that encourage adventure, while also allowing you to embrace your young age and naivety? Either way, the 19-year-old, up-and-coming R\u0026amp;B artist, Khalid, and his debut album \u003ci\u003eAmerican Teen\u003c/i\u003e are exactly what you’re looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvery track on this album that was released on March 3 will leave listeners reminiscing about the past, whether the focus is on the relatively carefree days of one\u0026rsquo;s teenage years or on past relationships and heartbreaks. Khalid made it obvious that he made \u003ci\u003eAmerican Teen\u003c/i\u003e with the intention of incorporating both overwhelming instances of nostalgia and heartache: “The album is a compilation of my youth. The mistakes I’ve made, the heartbreaks I went through, the love that I got, and all the love that I lost. A lot of my songs are about loneliness and losing relationships. Even the ones that are happy, there’s a lonely undertone to them.” (Hot New Hip Hop 2017, March 2).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe intense level of sentimentality that he speaks of is certainly present in songs like “Coasting” and “Shot Down.” The lyrics in the first verse of “Coasting” are emotional and relatable enough to leave listeners feeling as if they’d just taken a knife to the heart: “Maybe you weren\u0026rsquo;t the one for me/But deep down I wanted you to be/I\u0026rsquo;ll still see you in my dreams/All the things that I did for you, just wasn’t it for you.” Khalid’s beautifully crafted lyrics, coupled with his unique and divinely haunting vocal riffs, will have everyone hitting that ‘repeat one song’ button quicker than Kylie Jenner ‘premiering’ his most famous song, “Famous,” on her Snapchat last May.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the free-spirits with wild hearts, tracks “Young Dumb \u0026amp; Broke,” “Location,” and “American Teen” are the songs for you. “Young Dumb \u0026amp; Broke” features more of a ‘young, wild, and free’ vibe, with its slow yet upbeat tempo and care-free, drug-referencing lyrics: “I\u0026rsquo;m so high at the moment/I\u0026rsquo;m so caught up in this/Yeah, we\u0026rsquo;re just young, dumb and broke/But we still got love to give.” “Location,” the song that launched the 19-year-old’s career features a gorgeous xylophone-sounding instrument that carries the song’s cheery and overall ‘fun, relaxed summer romance’ feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, \u003ci\u003eAmerican Teen\u003c/i\u003e is an album that someone might imagine as the soundtrack to their own melodramatic summer of high school. Jam packed with songs longing for a non-committal fling, sorrows over past love affairs, overcoming these love affairs, and a general idea of jovial happiness and freedom, \u003ci\u003eAmerican Teen \u003c/i\u003esets the standard for a plethora of other up-and-coming artists planning to release music this spring.\u003c/p\u003e",

Back then, conspiracy theories survived in the dark corners of the internet where trolls spent hours connecting the dots to create a scenario in which our believed premise of existence isn’t true. Every symbolic gesture, action, and consequence was part of a grand scheme to control and manipulate for a larger purpose. But for the sake of what? No one knew. The very act of discussing secret societies made you feel that you were part of one. We become so intrigued by the idea of an entity being able to have so much power in predicting the unintended consequences of our actions that we don’t realize how much power we give to these over-exaggerated narratives as we allow them to reshape history and culture.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe dim lighting of the café blankets a shadow across the hipster’s face as stone cold expressions and solemn nods react exaggeratedly to this newly discovered reality. This reality, taken shape in the form of a theory, grounded by speculation and coincidence. In the words of Socrates, it’s true, the only thing we know, is that we know nothing. But that was then, and now that Donald Trump is president, I believe we are entering into an era where objective knowledge has become a non-falsifiable entity used to manipulate US citizens to turn us against one another.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ve seen the signs of conspiracy theories on the rise: the recent wiretapping scandal, voter fraud, rapists crossing the border illegally, “Pizzagate,” and the infamous “alternative facts” used to propagate the notion that citizens and government officials alike cannot be trusted. President Trump fired his National Security adviser this past February, Michael Flynn, not for conspiring with the Russians, but instead because he couldn’t “trust him.”  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump has created a narrative to suggest that any evidence that negates him is part of some larger scheme to sabotage him. As a result, he’s allowed for a non-falsifiable existence to take shape, wherein his beliefs – his conspiracy theories – can never be deemed as incorrect because every piece of evidence becomes part of the grand plot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs confusion, paranoia, and combative culture have created a divide amongst races, political parties, and families, I argue that it is important now more than ever to disregard the grand scheme Trump suggests, and focus on the objective reality we can observe and prove to be true. We are entering a presidency where deranged tweets in the wee hours of the night overshadow  threats to health care and other public services may affect the lives of millions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs millennials, we need to find a way to be creative and truly reach across the aisle to learn about other ideologies rather than allowing a master schemer to set us against one another. The first steps to fascism include causing disruption, distrust, and chaos amongst civilians - we therefore must focus on the bigger picture and not allow these conspiracy theories to cause a regime shift which undermines American values. \u003c/p\u003e",

The silent majority made their voices heard in November and we’re now about two months into what some people would call the political freak show.  Make no mistake; this politics of chaos is not the norm. This unchecked and ongoing level of corruption which is sadly turning into something new each and every day of the week it seems, is not business as usual.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAssuming that America would make a sound decision last year proves how things can change drastically from year to year. Our new president will be in office until 2020, which feels like a very very long time, unless you ask \u003ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/11/prediction-professor-who-called-trumps-big-win-also-made-another-forecast-trump-will-be-impeached/?utm_term=.645be7f160d4\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eProf. Allan Lichtman\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLooking forward, voters should realize that this time next year in March 2018, candidates will be campaigning for over 30 Senate seats up for grabs. Plus, all 435 house seats will be on the line too.Since 1934, the party of a newly elected president has suffered an average loss of 23 seats in the House in the following midterm. Those are promising numbers for the newest opposition party, the Democrats.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI know I’m throwing out a lot of numbers and dates out there but the main point is that a year goes by in a blink of an eye.  And although it can seem like an eternity until the next election, 2018 will be here before we know it. And that can be the first civic step towards deciding what kind of leadership we as voters want representing us.  For those of us eager to exercise that civic right\u0026hellip;March can’t come soon enough.\u003c/p\u003e",

This is the existential question facing witch house creators, evident from the final leg of the Sidewalks and Skeletons US tour that I attended March 7. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePeople often criticize witch house as being a formulaic, gimmicky offshoot of synth pop that primarily consists of impressions of Crystal Castles – obnoxiously distorted synths, compressed drums, rhythmic glitches, nu-rave chord patterns that have an almost defiantly amateurish quality, and vocals that alternate between high-pass filtered screaming or shoegazey whispers. Like many of the most popular witch house producers, the UK based Sidewalks and Skeletons is skilled at recreating this eerie, danceable combination. The primary addition that Sidewalks, and openers Brothel and Resonata, bring to the table is the incorporation of trap rhythms. While this sounds interesting in theory, the result often feels like the equivalent of a 2spooky, Halloween high school party while the VHS series plays softly in the background. The most disappointing thing about the direction that witch house seems poised to take is that both dark synth pop and trap are interesting genres individually. Yet somehow, Sidewalks and Skeletons and other producers have fallen to the insane clown posse curse – the inability for dark “edgy” rock music to incorporate black music tropes without sounding incredibly corny. When paired with haunting synth chords, the exaggerated tempo swings of a kick drum followed by twenty hi-hats create an effect that is not unlike the cringe-inducing beat drops that characterize dubstep. That said, let me quickly add that I love a lot of early, more straightforward Sidewalks and Skeletons singles (”Goth” is pure Crystal Castles fan service along the lines of \u0026ldquo;Suffocation,” \u0026quot;Pap Smear,” \u0026quot;Courtship Dating” etc.), and to producer Jake Lee\u0026rsquo;s credit, his use of trap beats in songs like \u0026quot;Frozen Star” are more tasteful and sincere than many of his peers. His music has a brooding, wounded quality, often evoking a foggy graveyard stroll more than a foggy Rick Owens photo shoot in Little Tokyo. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, I cannot help but wonder if Sidewalks and Skeletons, and witch house generally, suffers from embracing its post-ironic darkness. How many inverted crosses on oversized black t-shirts does it take before the symbol becomes a fetish, devoid of the philosophical angst that makes goth interesting in the first place? Crystal Castles may have always been self-consciously edgelord – but the lyrics were at least thoughtful, cryptic, feminist, and politically confrontational. With that stripped away, and the production fused with appropriated trap beats, it can be hard to take witch house seriously. Of course, many witch house producers may revel in this repudiation of critical values. The microgenre primarily exists on SoundCloud, which has a culture that is proudly anti-formal and anti-critical. The benefit of this is that its participants have summoned a unique brand and produced some extremely catchy dance music. However, without critical attention, its fan base sometimes encourages the worst aspects of the genre. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\n\n\nAt last night\u0026rsquo;s show, for every moment of pure, tragic beauty, there was a moment where a promoter was encouraging me to “jump the fuck up.” As if that was not enough to ruin one\u0026rsquo;s immersion, there was a guy parked left of stage who took every moment of relative quiet – which should presumably be used for the audience to reflect on mortality – to yell “FUCK YEAH!” as loud as possible. My friend, a fellow sadboy, asked this man to stop. The man proceeded to pat him on the back and then yell “FUCK YEAH!” in his face. This is of course, fine, and I am loathe to police anyone\u0026rsquo;s enjoyment of a show, even if many of the audience members drove from out of state to attend. Rather, this demonstrates that witch house\u0026rsquo;s audience mirrors its artistic schizophrenia. For every Wiccan, there were also two ravebros present. Ultimately, I had a good time. Picture the rave from the second Matrix movie, but with more fog; a bit like being on the inside of a spooky vape. Whatever its problems, the strength of witch house\u0026rsquo;s single power is undeniable and during the best moments of the show, everyone was having a wholesome, angsty time.\n\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Releasing in spurts on SoundCloud, the Singaporean UK-based artist displayed clear growth and depth even in her rough demos. Unlike her earlier work, \u003ci\u003ePathos\u003c/i\u003e presents a subtle sexiness and maturity paired with lo-fi motifs that produce six cloud-like tracks that flow, but are clearly independent. She opens with “Desire,” a soft track reminiscent of her angelic freshman release, but with a new energy motivated by substantial yearning. The track clicks and bumps while immersed in airy vocals that remain consistent throughout the entire EP. However, the starry instrumental “Soul Catcher” claims its place as well, providing a brief intermission marked by twinkles, echoes, and repetition. These are standard elements present throughout Yeule’s small, yet memorable discography, with each track serving to provide the listener with an escape that is easily accessible and drenched in emotion. Perhaps the most divergent track is “Angel’s Wings,” which features Japanese vocals and upbeat rhythms, but the general feeling remains the same - Yeule is embracing her listeners, soothing them with her own emotional experiences and matured sensibilities. “About Her” is perhaps the most effective at expressing sensuality and projecting astral sounds. Yeule quietly requests tender intimacy (“Breathe me into your lungs”) overlaid with sparkly vocal samples and chiming bells. It is a lovely start to the end of the EP, filled with concentrated warmth unique to bedroom productions. The final track, “Promise,” is just what its title implies - it is a hopeful instrumental that reverberates with breathy samples from Yeule juxtaposed by tonal bursts that collect and disperse throughout. “Promise” ends rather abruptly, appropriately contrasting with the steady flow of the EP and drawing \u003ci\u003ePatho\u003c/i\u003es to a close. The entirety of the EP displays Yeule’s growth as a producer while also providing a unique sensory experience that is comfortable yet provocative, leaving a lasting warmth with the listener.\u003c/p\u003e",

And I mean the absolute bottom; the more crude, unsightly, and strange the cover art, the greater the chance it’ll receive my review. With this being said, there is no wonder as to why I chose the album featured here. The art for Flow Tribe’s fourth studio album, \u003ci\u003eBoss\u003c/i\u003e, is an artistic wonder and a marvel of graphic design, yet is perhaps the greatest musical example of the phrase “don’t judge a book by its cover.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFlow Tribe, a funk-rock band formed in 2004 from New Orleans, is prominently known within the area for their high energy live performances. The city’s distinct style has certainly left an impression on the band not only in their album art, but also within their sound. The inclusion of a blaring horn section, unconventional instrumentation, and a loose backing band seems to pay homage to the second line parades of their hometown. While these aspects shine best through Flow Tribe’s live performances, Boss presents itself as a modern interpretation of the second lines, combining the traditional art form with funky synth and some light hip hop.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith an ambitious combination of styles it’s no wonder that the album doesn’t quite hit the mark. Through exceptionally shallow lyrical content and some outright forgettable tracks (see “Don’t Want to Be in Love,” “Turning Table”), there is no reason to believe that this will be a perfect listen. These tracks are akin to the filler content of a Justin Timberlake album with a few huge hits, written just for the sake of being there. However, once the listener ventures into the second half of the album, they’re greeted with a slew of catchy tunes worth listening twice or three times, complete with a swaggering brass band to round out the sound (see “Diamond,” “You Know What It’s About”).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, \u003ci\u003eBoss\u003c/i\u003e far exceeded my expectations and even offered a few moments of greatness. There is no arguing the musical ability of Flow Tribe despite their taste in visuals, and in their fourth release have remained true to their funk-rock genre while adding a touch of modern flair. If you enjoy Trombone Shorty, Tuxedo, or St. Paul \u0026amp; The Broken Bones, then Flow Tribe just might be the band for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e5.5/10\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten by Lillian Stanwick \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI know that on May 19 a panel of D-list celebrity judges determined the official winners of UCLA\u0026rsquo;s 2017 Spring Sing. As announced in Pauley Pavilion, the winners in each category were BEL, Eva B. Ross \u0026amp; David Miller, HELEN, the Scattertones, and HOOLIGAN, with Inner Sanctum taking home the Bruin Choice Award and Eva B. Ross \u0026amp; David Miller winning the Northern California Alumni Grand Sweepstakes Award. This article is not to say that the judges’ opinions are wrong or to disparage any of the winning performers. I must say that Eva Barrosse and David Miller\u0026rsquo;s duet was superb, bluesy and worthy of winning the top prize, but I will now proceed not to mention them for the remainder of this article as I present you the REAL winners and losers of 2017 Spring Sing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Winners\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e1. Jason Earles \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI know, SHOCKING. But think about it, when was the last time you thought about Jason Earles? Did you even know who Jason Earles was before Spring Sing? Exactly. This guy is 40, divorced, and peaked on the Disney Channel eight years ago. Yet somehow he ended up on everyone\u0026rsquo;s Snapchat story, and you know that at least 1,000 people googled his name that night when they brought him out as a judge. Judging Spring Sing was probably the biggest publicity boost this actor has had in a long time. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why or how he ended up on the judging panel for Spring Sing, but it certainly didn\u0026rsquo;t hurt his career.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e2. HELEN\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYes, HELEN was determined to be the best band at Spring Sing by the judging panel, so calling them a winner isn\u0026rsquo;t anything new. Libby Hsieh, Laura Savage, and Temme Scott\u0026rsquo;s performance of the original song \u0026ldquo;In the Morning,\u0026rdquo; was a knockout. All three came to the stage with exceptional vocal skills. Their song was soulful and smooth with impressive instrumentation. Furthermore, the haunting lyrics paired with each of the artist\u0026rsquo;s crooning voices made for a moving performance. It\u0026rsquo;s upsetting that this band was a Spring Sing-exclusive creation. It\u0026rsquo;s even more upsetting that all three members of HELEN are graduating this year. UCLA is losing some exceptional talent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D2F2JYrv3QSc\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2F2JYrv3QSc?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e3. The Company\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor me, the best part of Spring Sing was The Company\u0026rsquo;s transitionary comedy sketches. The first sketch that they opened with was by far their weakest. The skit about college tours just missed the mark, and it made me nervous that The Company was about to fill Spring Sing with cringe-worthy bits. But the group quickly recovered with their hilarious \u0026ldquo;Study Abroad\u0026rdquo; short, and as the night wore on, the sketches got better and better, culminating with \u0026ldquo;Powell Owl,\u0026rdquo; which took home the award for the best comedy sketch. I was particularly impressed with Avalon Penrose\u0026rsquo;s farcical song \u0026ldquo;I Fell In Love in an Uber Pool.\u0026rdquo; The lyrics were witty, and her voice could hold its own compared to the other singers in the show. I would highly recommend that one check out the \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/UCLASpringSing\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSpring Sing Youtube channel \u003c/a\u003efor full videos of The Company\u0026rsquo;s live and pre-recorded sketches.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately where there are winners there are…\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Losers\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e1. Naya Zamaana A Cappella\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a general disclaimer, I loathe a capella. I don\u0026rsquo;t love Pitch Perfect. I hate the idea of attending an a cappella showcase. And if someone ever plays Pentatonix on UCLA Radio, it may result in my sudden departure from the station. It\u0026rsquo;s safe to say that I\u0026rsquo;m not an expert when it comes to judging a capella, but I think Naya Zamaana was the best group that performed. From an outsider perspective, their performance was better than the other two, so I\u0026rsquo;m surprised that they didn\u0026rsquo;t walk away with the win for best a capella. This group was robbed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e2. Everyone who didn’t go to Spring Sing\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough every performance was recorded and posted on the Spring Sing Youtube page (again, highly recommend you check it out), the audio that accompanies them is lacking. Most of the videos included the audio from the microphones but omitted the amps, so some instruments are absent from the audio. Any performance that included an electric guitar is missing most of the guitar\u0026rsquo;s sound. You can hear the guitars, but the sound was somehow altered during the recording process. It\u0026rsquo;s unfortunate for those watching online that some of the stronger performances, such as that from HELEN, don\u0026rsquo;t sound as good on video as they did in person.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe good news is that there will always be next year.\u003c/p\u003e",

The inspiration for the tile was a play off of the term “cabrones” Maria recounted how her strict aunt would disapprove of her rebellious nature and sigh, “pinche cabrona.” She also explained that the ‘x’ in Cabronx is designed to represent the LGBT and gender non-conforming members of the Latino community. Mateo added that ‘cabronx’ is representative of their personalities, as they see themselves as “baddies and nonconformists because they are ‘out-there’ and make their presence known.” Cabronx provided the opportunity for them to embrace their latinidad and challenge the notions of what being latino entails. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoth DJs also elaborated on what cultura (culture) means to them. Maria explained the nuances of cultura, and the preconceived delineation of anything other, such as her artsy personality. She described people’s inability to reconcile her artsy nature with her Latinidad. In a more general sense, cultura is about being connected to the past, present and marking the path towards the future. Maria describes it as a “decolonized view of xicanismo.” Mateo added that it incorporates tradition with heritage and that it’s essentially the ability to embrace your roots with pride: “It’s about love, art, and repping all the time.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI asked the duo why they decided to work together, as they have such undeniable chemistry, but very contrasting personalities. They explained that they met as springterns in 2016 and had always joked about starting a show together. Their idea didn’t become solidified until much later. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, I asked them what legacy they hoped to leave behind. They responded that they wanted to make the Latinx presence known and show that they’re “here to stay” by using their platform to inform their listeners about injustices. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\nThis duo is a force to be reckoned with.

Savior’s smooth voice over Alex Turner’s retro guitars gives her an old-fashioned French sound: she is soft and feminine, but unafraid to tell the truth. With a lot of character and talent, Savior launches her career on a good foundation — but Alex Turner and producer James Ford’s involvement take over the album too much, making it sound like a spin off of Turner’s side work, \u003ci\u003eLast Shadow Puppet.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first song, “Mirage,” launches the album with a bang. Savior unapologetically talks about her problems with her record label that initially wanted to turn her into the next Katy Perry. During the lines, “I sing songs about whatever the fuck they want,” she gets real and you immediately trust her experience and her story. Her lyrics emit the anger of an artist struggling to find her personality in a business that does not value her. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe following song, “Bones,” written by Alex Turner, seems more forgettable than the captivating first song. However, it still manages to be a strong piece with the bass and the percussion shining throughout. It also introduces an emotional side of Savior — one that sings, “I just can’t pretend I’m not in love with you/ That’s not true.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe popular hit “Shades” strengthens the album with a charm that derives from quirky bass lines and an upbeat tempo. The single encapsulates exactly what Savior wanted her music to sound like: “Sassy, impolite spaghetti western music.” Besides the musical magnetisms of the song, it also delivers great lyrics, showing off Savior’s ability as a songwriter. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring the next two songs “Girlie” and “Frankie,” Savior exits her personal world and enters into the music industry, where she refuses to become another pop star that is infatuated with the Hollywood life. The ironic ballad “Girlie” depicts a profile for the banal girls of the industry. The song sounds a lot like Turner with the lyrics; “Got that look upon her face says she is twenty minutes late.” One starts to question Savior’s authenticity, as Turner’s voice overpowers hers. The latter has less influence and tells the story of a Hollywood affair, while the music is as intriguing and mysterious as it gets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“M.T.M.E” flares in this calm album with harsher electric guitars and Savior’s haunting vocals. During this song, she yells “I’m just fine” and screams. The whole song makes you uncomfortable as Savior sings about a lover that did her wrong by leaving her unexpectedly. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second half of the album lowers the tempo. “Audaline,” with its quirky riffs still manages to come out strong. However by the time “Cupid” and “Til You’re Mine” finish, the listener feels used to the shtick. The music starts to resemble the signature \u003ci\u003eLast Shadow Puppets\u003c/i\u003e sound. To be honest, Alex Turner and co Miles Kane could sing these songs and no one would notice. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTurner’s influence reaches its climax in the song that picks the album up, “Vanishing Point.” The lyrics, “Spectacular black light poster neon sky/ To which the sun so quickly unsubscribes/ Want to call it a night/ But I think they might be onto us” fuses Arctic Monkeys’ third album \u003ci\u003eHumbug \u003c/i\u003ebut overall strengthens the album. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe final song, “Mystery Girl,” reminds you of what Savior is about. It encapsulates the intrigue, the deception, and a certain mystery. As she sings “Don’t try to calm me down,” the listener understands her driving force. It might get lost between the smooth vocals and old-fashioned music, but she has a message and a certain wisdom. The audience believes her perceptions of the world around her. Although her voice does not sound fully her own yet, \u003ci\u003eBelladonna of Sadness \u003c/i\u003edescribes the story of an artist finding her way with her world and with her art.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eBest:\u003c/b\u003e “Shades,” “Mirage”\u003c/p\u003e",

Their newest EP, \u003ci\u003eThe Rolling, Driftless North\u003c/i\u003e, is best described as a hazy daydream. The introductory track, titled \u0026ldquo;Reflection No. 2 - A Treatise on Being\u0026rdquo; is an ethereal soundscape, marked by the soft rhythms of a passing train. It\u0026rsquo;s a fitting start, drenching the remaining four tracks in a yellowish hue that is reminiscent of the EP\u0026rsquo;s cover image. \u0026ldquo;Eleven Weeks\u0026rdquo; is the next track, a muted reflection on fading communication. The starry-eyed vocals and twinkling synths immerse the listener into a blurred nostalgia, filled with trees \u0026ldquo;like something from a movie.\u0026rdquo;  The third track, titled \u0026ldquo;Pale Blue,\u0026rdquo; is an upbeat ode to suburbia, reminiscent of early Craft Spells. It conjures up images of sun-soaked drives, while still maintaining the band’s soft, dreamy sound. \u0026ldquo;Driftless\u0026rdquo; continues with this mood. Chords and faint vocals build upon each other into a burst of airy energy. The final track, \u0026ldquo;Four Portraits,\u0026rdquo; closes the EP with the slow paced contemplation with which it opened. I find this song to be the culmination of \u003ci\u003eThe Rolling, Driftless North\u003c/i\u003e. It combines a delicate soundscape with gentle vocals that result in a romantic whole. The velvety instrumentation, combined with poetic vocals, completes the dream that Vansire has created for us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DoFt4P46c00Q\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oFt4P46c00Q?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\nI have found that tying music to emotion has allowed me to better understand its message, and Vansire\u0026rsquo;s \u003ci\u003eThe Rolling, Driftless North \u003c/i\u003eis no exception. Thus, like many of my interactions with music, I associate this EP with a very particular moment. It was early afternoon at the beginning of April. I was hot, greasy and temperamental. But as I walked home, my music library shuffled to the sound of vocals that were so soft, they sounded like bells. I immediately felt better, more rooted in place — despite the dreamscape in which I was placed. I hope that this review allows other people to experience a similar feeling, or perhaps something utterly different.\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

And yet, people still can’t speak to its plot. To be fair, \u003ci\u003eAtlas Shrugged\u003c/i\u003e is long. Too Long. Abstract. Multi-dimensional. But even the phonies who claimed to have read it don’t want to forget the significance, so they get t-shirts printed and overpriced bumper stickers with the phrase “Who is John Galt?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWho is Vic Spencer?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRiddled with the he-said-she-said hearsay of the real world and skill-set that only the Grammy’s would ignore, a movement is in place. Vic Spencer, the Chicago based rapper with an affinity for honesty and White Castle burgers, visited UCLA Radio on April 19. He’s hyperactive with a smile and open arms to embrace. The way he embraces a stranger is the way he approaches life: as a good listener who doesn’t second guess his ideas or future plans. He laughs in between thoughts, and though pessimistic about where hip-hop is headed, believes in himself and the value that true artists can bring. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Radio is what has changed the most…When I was growing up in Chicago, we had stations that would play the major artists, but we also had radio stations that catered to the underground hip hop scene. It was hosted by the Ghetto Boys, playing the low-key cats. I was surprised at the contrast, because ghetto boys was more like straight forward, slap-ya-mama type music, but then they play The Roots.. Now we just don’t have anything. XM Shouldn’t be ‘the option’ because a lot of people don’t have XM Radio. It’s kinda crazy.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpencer recognizes the need to adjust to the times and use app based technology like Spotify, but he explains that older generations and older fans haven’t adjusted yet. Using Twitter as a platform, Spencer has gotten involved in hip hop beef and connected with artists he’s idolized. In a world where hip hop artists are viewed as modern social justice heroes and changemakers, I question his role within society at large. “I just do what Victor does. Now that I have the legends looking up to me, that’s where the expectation is now. I do a lot of things outside the music in the Streets of Chicago, I do what I know works.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChicago is famous for the authenticity and unique sound of its rappers, but Spencer doesn’t believe that artists should unite just based on their similar roots. “If you’re talking about the Kanye from the beginning of his career, you can say I respect it… now, hell nah. I do respect what he’s trying to do, but just because I respect it doesn’t mean I agree with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2016, Spencer found himself in a hip hop battle with Mick Jenkins. Spencer reflects on the idea of rap disses today: “Rap battles back in the day was a real thing. People’s feelings was hurt… Now it’s just for attention. People have diss tracks, just to do it. Like, what? Beef really happens if there’s something wrong. If someone has beef, they make a record. It’s all a promotional tool now. I wouldn’t call it beef, it’s just what I make it about. I will destroy you lyrically. When I saw (Jenkins), he didn’t say a word to me at all, but then when I made a statement on Twitter, he was one of the first people to run his mouth.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpencer is committed to his brand and promoting sound that makes sense to him. Instead of following what the mainstream considers “good,” Spencer’s standard is based on how the music should make you feel. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Ghostwriters 100 percent take away the credibility of artists. Good music is the type that touches my soul. Me and conceptual songs don’t get along, like, say when people make a song about the police… No one’s listening to ‘Fight the Power’ now. I want people to be able to listen to my work at any given moment and so I just consider making that kind of music. I like stories.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWorking with a plethora of rappers, like Chance the Rapper, Spencer has seen changes happen in hip hop as commodification and money become involved and artists become more successful. “I’m disappointed in Chance the Rapper musically. He used to be a rapper. To me, he’s not. Just because he doesn’t touch my soul doesn’t mean he’s touching millions of others, though. I feel that the music that I do is not a room for opportunity in Chicago. I want to be able to have an opportunity to be a different plate on the table.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpencer has released hundreds of tracks over the years, and most recently collaborated to create “VicTree,” a unique vibe which is described as “soul-trap.” Spencer has big goals for the next year, including more music, merch, and collaborations. I jokingly ask when he’s moving to LA.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I like the smell of Chicago. Sometimes it smells like gunpowder, sometimes it smells like weed. I’m immune to all of it. But LA is a different monster… I know why they call it LA LA land. I believe life is a pot of gumbo full of surprises and you don’t want to be caught up in what’s being displayed. All the things that happen on a negative level can be turned into a positive. Always. If you believe in it, you have the attribute to go after it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpencer has laid the groundwork and influenced the sound of hip hop for the past 15 years. A phantom in the scene, when we ask who is Vic Spencer, the answer becomes obvious: Who is hip hop?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVisit Vertigo’s \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/vertigoradio-760164534/don-kaiper-interviews-vic-spencer-1\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSoundCloud\u003c/a\u003e to here the full interview. \u003c/p\u003e",

Playing with a new drummer and a new bass player on this tour, so we’re just getting everyone into the right space, playing the right songs and making sure we all know what we’re doing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAlex:\u003c/b\u003e That’s super exciting because you’re kicking off your tour here in Los Angeles, but you also have a song called “LA Dream,” which feels like one of the most personal songs off the album. What was the process of recording that song like?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJulia:\u003c/b\u003e Yeah, that was the last song, I think I recorded on the album because I was struggling to get into the right headspace. You don’t realize when you are recording that you need to, kind of, perform the songs, more than just make sure you don’t mess it up. It’s more important that you actually perform them well. I struggled to get back into the place I was when I wrote the song. It’s one of my favorite songs that I’ve written, and I still enjoy performing it, which is good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAlex:\u003c/b\u003e Yeah, you have these super poignant themes in your lyrics, but you’re also able to sprinkle in this really great amount of humor, like in your song “Small Talk,” where you compare your dad to Zach Braff. Where do you gather inspiration for all of your lyrics, and do they also draw on your personal experiences?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJulia: \u003c/b\u003eI think on that record especially they were all personal experiences, because at the time I wasn’t a professional musician or anything, so I was kind of just using music as a way to get things out and try and just figure out how to express things properly. I think that the humor… I am a huge fan of Fiona Apple and Leonard Cohen’s lyrics — I think they manage to both sing about big things like love, or loss, or life, but in a way that kind of is poking fun of it, a little bit, or at least just seeing the humor in the tragedy of something, and that’s the music I really like listening to, so that’s kind of what I try to do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAlex:\u003c/b\u003e You also mention your musical influences include Bjork and Doris Day and Billy Bragg who are all incredible, but who do you listen to as your guilty pleasure music?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJulia: \u003c/b\u003eGuilty pleasure music…I’d say like… What’s my guilty pleasure… I don’t know. I like, I mean I guess, not to say it’s bad, I would definitely do a lot of nostalgia stuff like Mandy Moore and Avril Lavigne’s first record, which I actually think is a pretty good record, still. So I definitely listen to that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAlex:\u003c/b\u003e I’ve also heard you say on an interview that you really like diners. What is the best diner you’ve been to while touring or traveling?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJulia:\u003c/b\u003e I wouldn’t remember any of the names of the diners, I think just more the experiences I’ve had in the diner. I think l had a really great night in a diner in Memphis— I think it was just a Denny’s actually, like a 24-hour Denny’s, and it was the Fourth of July, and I had nowhere to stay because I forgot to book accommodations and then I kind of got to Memphis thinking I would find a hostel and then realized everything was booked and so the people at Denny’s kind of were alright with me just sitting in Denny’s and eating pancakes every three hours until the sun came up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAlex:\u003c/b\u003e You’ve spoken a lot about working through feeling good enough or not good enough in the music realm. How do you personally find your own confidence as a musician?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJulia:\u003c/b\u003e I think it changes a lot depending on the day and depending on who I’m playing with as well and how they treat me. That has a lot to do with it, because everyone contributes different things into a band and into music and I felt in the beginning I wasn’t contributing much, because I’m not technically very proficient in the way that I didn’t study music or I didn’t put in the hours of guitar playing that a lot of people around me have; but I think I’m now realizing that that doesn’t mean that you’re not contributing anything just because you can’t necessarily, you know, say you’re in music or something. I realize that songwriting is a big part of it, and that that shouldn’t be dismissed. Today I’m feeling pretty good, the band I’m playing with are all really lovely and really supporting and really keen, so that helps.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAlex:\u003c/b\u003e I read that you initially wanted to be a social worker and then you pursued music and then you worked on a factory production line making essential oils. What was the timeline of all of that like— when was the turning point when you knew music was what you wanted to fully invest in?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJulia: \u003c/b\u003eI finished uni when I was 24 and I stayed at the factory for two years, I think (so when I was from twenty four to twenty five) and I made my record just before I turned twenty five, and then halfway through last year when I played SXSW was kind of the turning point. I was just going to give myself two years after uni to see if it was going to work out, and I worked at the factory for just enough money to make the record, and then I played SXSW and had to take time off work for that, and then after that I just kept getting booked to do things, so I had to keep taking more time off work until it was just pointless going back and yeah, so then here were are today. So I haven’t really been a full time musician for that long— since August of last year, I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAlex: \u003c/b\u003eI think that’s really interesting, because you are such a new musician and the themes of your album deal a lot with the concept of coming of age — what age do you think culminated the process of coming of age for you, or do you think that coming of age is a lifelong process instead?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJulia:\u003c/b\u003e I think when I wrote the record, or when I recorded it, that was my coming of age. I thought that I came through this massive learning curve of what love actually means and what being an adult actually means. and now that I’m twenty six and I’ve spent the last touring and kind of dealing with other things, I’m once again thinking, “No-no, this is my coming of age.” You realize that being a full-time musician is not some easy, fun thing that you might think it is. It’s actually incredibly tiring. You spend pretty much your whole life away from places and away from people. I think it’s just an ongoing thing, because I’m sure I’ll look back in two years time and I’m going to look back on all the epiphanies I’ve had this year and be like, “You knew nothing!” Yeah, I definitely think it’s something you’re constantly coming to. Which is good, because I think if you figured it out at one age, then your life would be pretty boring.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAlex: \u003c/b\u003eThroughout social media you’re known as “a singer-songwriter who will put your smile on dial but only for a short while” — what are the origins of that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJulia:\u003c/b\u003e It’s funny that you say that. That was a joke that me and my drummer tom wrote — I was having to update my Facebook page, and I think he wrote that just as some funny thing and then I’ve never changed it. I don’t know what that means actually. It could mean that I’m very approachable and relatively happy in my stage presence, and then I start singing and everyone’s like, “Aww that’s depressing…”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAlex:\u003c/b\u003e The nostalgic themes of your album are also really strong. How does nostalgia affect you today? Do you think it limits you, or does it serve as more of a push forward?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJulia:\u003c/b\u003e Right now I’ve been obsessed with \u003ci\u003eDawson’s Creek\u003c/i\u003e. It’s been this ongoing obsession and right now I’m ridiculously obsessed, and I watch it with my little brother who is nineteen, and we’ve been working through the seasons for the last three years because we’ve both been away doing lots of different stuff— we’ve taken ages to actually finish it because we won’t watch an episode without each other, and I think that my current intense obsession with the story line is concerning, because I think nostalgia in that way, yeah it feels like you’re holding on to some kind of idealistic simple life like when you look back to life before phones and before social media and before big decisions had to be make you can totally just romanticize it and when I look back to that time in my life it wasn’t incredible. It was definitely equally as hard in different ways. So you know, \u003ci\u003eDawson’s Creek \u003c/i\u003emakes it look like everything was great but it wasn’t. But I think it’s good to look back and use things in your past but it’s also really important to not look back and romanticize being a teenager, because when you’re a teenager the whole time you’re wishing you were an adult. I’m trying to be more present and not watch too much \u003ci\u003eDawson’s Creek\u003c/i\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAlex:\u003c/b\u003e Lastly, what can fans expect from this upcoming tour?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJulia: \u003c/b\u003eI’ve got some new songs that I’m playing - just trying some new stuff out. I bought some new shoes, so I won’t be wearing white sneakers anymore which was my costume of last year. I have new band members who are Canadian and they are extremely friendly. I’d only known them for seven hours but we’re about to spend five weeks in a car together. so you might experience pure friendship on stage or irritation. I don’t know, we’ll see!\u003c/p\u003e",

The EP is the culmination of three years of astonishingly rigorous production that has resulted in thirty total tracks. Shifting away from their usual lo-fi sound, High Sunn gives us a twinkling dream pop record that Cheromiah describes as a reflection of his \u0026ldquo;experiences dealing with love, rejection, and yearning, and having a heart and mind full of dreams and desires.\u0026rdquo; This holds true from the EP’s start to finish, as each track presents a unique glimpse into tender teenage romance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eHopeless Romantic\u003c/i\u003e’s opening track, “Joy of Romance” is a beaming declaration of affection paired with upbeat guitar and drums with a forlorn twist. It’s a suitable introduction, giving us a taste of the key themes and sounds that will proceed throughout the entire EP: beachy rhythms and delicately crooned romantic proclamations. The next track, “Ramen Waitress,” picks up the pace with intense riffs and Cheromiah purring over a “delightful” individual who is “just the one” for him. The track is a heartfelt request for physical contact, all the while keeping with the EP’s upbeat, danceable sound. “Holding Hands” is next, and it’s slower, sing-songy tone brings a new sentimental flare with yet another breathy, sweet message: “all I want is your hand.” Cheromiah is joined by another vocalist on the track, suggesting mutual feelings that are only strengthened by the following song titled “Tears.” The track introduces glimmering synthesizers with a deeper, slower sound, and serves as a promise of emotional support and escape. It highlights a key theme that is present throughout the entire EP, one which emphasizes the hard but wonderful effort that romance requires, and what that looks like for Cheromiah. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Polaroids” trails this message with distorted vocals and dancing synthesizers. \u003ci\u003eHopeless Romantic\u003c/i\u003e closes with the paradoxically sun-filled “Good Evening,” a familiar celebration of discovering a special person who you desperately wish to stay, or at least meet again. Yet, Cheromiah admits this second meeting doesn’t always goes as planned, lamenting over a relationship that changed, but whose impression remains. “You’re still haunting me” is the final, abrupt end to \u003ci\u003eHopeless Romantic\u003c/i\u003e, leaving us yearning for more.\u003c/p\u003e",

Two years later, Cook carries the same elements of great songwriting with him, except this time he has a huge package in tow - his debut record, \u003ci\u003eSweet Dreamer\u003c/i\u003e. While some of the songs on \u003ci\u003eSweet Dreamer\u003c/i\u003e found their beginnings when Cook was in his early teens, each song on the record fits perfectly in line with one another. The songs paint a picture of who Cook is as both an artist and a person, and showcase the immense improvement and growth Cook has went through in terms of musicianship since the start of his career.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Kind of used to that single bed/I loved every pixel, every word you said,” Cook sings at the start of the album on “Biggest Fan.” Backed by the sweet strum of a guitar, these lyrics stand out as listeners are left to ponder what Cook could possibly be talking about in this song. As the track continues, it becomes clearer that Cook is describing the difficulties of a long-distance relationship that’s left him more enamored with his partner than before. What sets Cook apart from other artists at the moment is the way in which he expresses his experiences through his music, as he did on “Biggest Fan.” Whether it’s through the honest lyricism on songs like “Alive,” the irresistible hook on the album’s title-track “Sweet Dreamer,” the classic “Take Me Dancing,” or even the heart-breaking message left on ‘Habit,’ Cook opens up his world to anyone willing to listen to what he has to say.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DA6Pxne5Wouo\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A6Pxne5Wouo?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat said, the narratives found within \u003ci\u003eSweet Dreamer\u003c/i\u003e don’t necessarily discuss things that share a common connection with one another. However, as Cook has stated in a few interviews, \u003ci\u003eSweet Dreamer\u003c/i\u003e isn’t meant to be a concept album; it’s simply a piece of work that encapsulates the best of Cook so far, which he has succeeded in creating. All thirteen songs on this record are a delight to listen to, and it’s evident that Cook has spent a lot of time writing and practicing to create such quality pop songs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a whole, \u003ci\u003eSweet Dreamer\u003c/i\u003e is a great introduction to the story of Will Joseph Cook. It\u0026rsquo;s dreamy and sweet as the album\u0026rsquo;s title suggests, and while Cook may be stuck in the clouds a lot, \u003ci\u003eSweet Dreamer\u003c/i\u003e is one dream I\u0026rsquo;m glad was made into a reality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRecommended tracks:\u003c/b\u003e “Treat Me Like A Lover,” “Girls Like Me,” “Light of the Day”\u003c/p\u003e",

While he’s not a breakout artist, don’t let his debut album’s crude cover art fool you. Joseph provides the listener with a wide range of catchy tunes and impressive musicianship, while lending an intimate look into his life.\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith rough vocals and a powerful backing band, Joseph’s age seems evident in his music, eliciting the sounds of Bruce Springsteen in what I can only call a modern Classic Rock album. The track list begins with a highlight. The artist introduces you to his songwriting prowess with “Keep Moving Forward,” a dramatic and well-composed tune that lacks any lyrical stimulation. Unfortunately, lackluster lyrical content is a common trait among songs across the board, and, while it does not detract from the musicality, it certainly hurts to convey the emotion heard in Joseph’s voice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhere this album truly shines is in the fullness of its sound, via its great use of backing vocals and instruments that are not generally found in a typical rock band. “Let Her See You” and “Violet Still” further down the track list are fantastic examples of this sonic richness, but leave the listener to wonder whether or not his perhaps limited resources in the inception of this album were left to these gems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBilly Joseph’s album comes across largely as a project he started for fun to jam with his pals — which should by no means diminish the quality of its content — and is perhaps best evidenced by this music video Joseph released for the album’s single, “Dirty”:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DwxNXdgQ2fRQ\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wxNXdgQ2fRQ?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile the artist may have been fond of this tune enough to create a video for it, this song exhibits some of the least musical, slumping parts of the album. The disjointed playing and basic rhythms seem analogous to a square wheel, plodding its way through the song, akin to Billy Ray Cyrus’ “Achey Breaky Heart.” Paired with a downright crude music video, “Dirty” is a definite lowlight of Joseph’s album.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll in all, Billy Joseph’s energetic first album surprises the listener with its mostly impressive musicality and mixing, despite its amateur release. What seemed like a great deal of fun to record was equally fun to listen to, and hopefully there will be more content and improvement to come from Joseph, who is early into his late career.\u003c/p\u003e",

Beginning June 2nd, Phoenix will launch their world tour, playing alongside indie poster-boy acts like Mac Demarco, The Lemon Twigs, and Whitney. I sat down and had a chat with Thomas Mars—lead vocalist of the band to talk about what Phoenix has been up to during their four-year hiatus.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHey Thomas! How’s it going? \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eT: Good, it’s nice to chat with you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSo, what’s it like to be back after a four-year hiatus? The release of new music was quite sudden, seemingly almost out of nowhere. \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eT: Yeah, it really was out of nowhere. We stayed in the same room to write music for about 3 years, it’s really strange because we have the most boring, most unexciting life for three years and then for a year or half, we get to travel and live this exciting life playing music for people. It was like Groundhog day—we basically stayed in the same room just writing music for three years pretty much.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSounds like school. Living this unexciting life for the majority of your school days and then being free in the summer.\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eT: It’s similar to college, I’ve always been jealous of college in the US as a highlight of your life, where as in France it’s different and right from the beginning I couldn’t see myself committing to that. I’ve always envied the US for that culture.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eYeah, I guess college is really seen as this integral time of experimental development and pressure to have the best four years of their life.\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eT: Oh yeah, a lot of anticipation and pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCongrats on Sofia’s new movie, \u003ci\u003eThe Beguiled\u003c/i\u003e. Phoenix wrote the score for the movie. Are there any differences the songwriting process when you’re writing a score for a movie versus an album? \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eT: It’s easier. There are limits, and we have frames of reference when we write scores. As a director, Sofia guides us in the right direction, while when it comes to our own music, we are the captain of our own ships and it can be daunting with money and time. When we first started out, renting out a studio was so expensive and we had such a limited amount of instruments and time to play. Now, there exists all of these different possibilities, which can be overwhelming. When we have a frame it allows us to be faster and more productive. We have visual cues and a preexisting environment that lets writing come easier for us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"1000\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e8fee7e831bf22d9959cc969e7c97ffb/tumblr_inline_oqqzwxFUIZ1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"1000\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe new album experiments with a trio of three languages, blending English, some Italian, and French. What’s it like to write different melodies in all of these similar, but explicitly different languages?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eT: When we write songs, the first few melodies that come out with chords come out from mumble and nonsense. When we blended all of these different languages, I saw everyone’s eyes lit with fear and excitement. There is this leap of faith and bonding quality when you write it together. Some of our lyrics in this album refer to obscure gelatos,—we’re always trying to tell a story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eYeah, I’ve noticed this central theme of classic Italy in \u003ci\u003eTi Amo\u003c/i\u003e. Specifically, the theme of “television” seems to appear in \u003ci\u003eJ-boy\u003c/i\u003e, what’s the story behind that?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eT: There was a lot of inspiration that came from Italian and some German television rom our childhood memories. Now, you can simply watch it all on YouTube [laughs]. There’s a goldmine of references, which are far enough in our memory to create something contemporary about it. We were not trying to be authentic, rather slightly off.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAside from television, what else inspired you? I know artists can find inspiration from the most random physical objects out there like Mac Demarco and his Viceroy cigarettes; did the band find any particular “physical” items that helped shape the sound for Ti Amo?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eT: There were some items in the studio that I’m sure played a role that we were probably unaware of. I remember this portrait of the first French Astronaut—it was there the whole time and you know it wasn’t the most high-tech outfit, yet the guy still went to space. It was a motivation that it’s possible for us [laughs]. Everything has a visual cue at some point, but I think it’s interesting to mix two things that shouldn’t be together and don’t really get along. When it’s on the same song, they are forced to co-habit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"533\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aa159d3385151dbbfdd750378a3dd72d/tumblr_inline_oqqzusOy8e1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"533\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhoto by Ron Elkman\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eLet’s talk about the tour. Any particular festivals you excited to play?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eT: The ones I don’t know. To be in Chicago one night and then at the Hollywood bowl—it’s fun to get a taste of the world in one week. It’s like an extensive course. Some of the shows when you play for a small venue are really exciting. The place I’m least excited to play are the places with so music that it feels like a factory. For example, Glastonbury has over 200 bands, which feels overwhelming because it’s a giant festival. However, I’m excited to play them all!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWe talked earlier how contrast and juxtaposition between two things that should not go together can be fun to experiment with. Was it hard to make upward music in full contradiction with the political climate in Paris or did you draw inspiration from that unrest?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eT: Our music is the result of trying to create a conscious formula rather than a political statement. I don’t really know how to do be political with music [laughs.] The times call for being responsible—but we got into music because we didn’t want to be responsible. I’d feel like a hypocrite if I changed that. I vote, I do things my community, and the times are horrible. For music it wouldn’t be helpful for us to go there. I don’t think it’s escapism or denial, you can tell \u003ci\u003eTi Amo\u003c/i\u003e is made in dark times, but there are no political statements. What’s really powerful about the arts is it can be whatever it wants to be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eCatch Phoenix playing in Los Angeles on June 15\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e at the Hollywood Bowl with supporting acts Mac Demarco and The Lemon Twigs.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

He hails from Saskatchewan, Canada, and currently lives in a humble abode in The 6 (or Toronto for the uncultured readers). After opening for the Lumineers on their tour, he returned in April to bring us this album a month later. It is his first album under ANTI-, an international record label, and his first to earn multiple Juno and Canadian Independent Musician award nominations.\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The album opens with a hypnotizing cut labeled “The Magician.” Versatile instrumentation (Soothing strings, a floating oboe, and a driving guitar, to name a few) all blend together behind Shauf’s vocals. Singing about a person that has worked to extreme lengths to conceal everything and reveal nothing, “The Magician” is a lyrical high point in this conceptual album. Tagged with vintage EQs (with emphasis on the mid range), the melodies and ‘doo-doo-doo’s’ will have you humming along for all three minutes and 52 seconds. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe track is followed by a slower cut “Early to the Party.” Describing the multiple perspectives to a party arrival, this soft cut takes a look at all the guests, and one in particular, presumably his (ex)lover. This song is a textbook example of how to use crescendos and diminuendos, and should be observed by musicians. Shauf constantly builds and destroys this song, to leave the listener to a final 40-second session of isolated vocals that team up with a soft guitar and piano chords to mark one of the highlights in this album.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009“Twist Your Ankle,” the third cut, does more of the same work that the previous song does. Featuring a paced guitar chord progression, Shauf contemplates leaving the party altogether, since he faces discomfort.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The fourth track “Quite Like You” may very well be the best on the entire album. Shauf tells of dragging his own best friend to appeal to his ex with whom he recently broke up. A drum pattern that you tap your foot along to teams up with Shauf’s best melody to provide the perfect backdrop to this story. The song dives through twists and turns that are interlaced by a hook that will not leave your head — and this only leads to a cliffhanger that transitions the listener into the second half of the album.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DPSSLIAYit8k\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PSSLIAYit8k?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The fifth track, appropriately titled “Begin Again,” it reflects upon the inconveniences of a small town life through the lens of a confused lover. A driving piano progression leads the listener into the next track that ties closely with the previous one, “The Worst in You.” The inconveniences evolve into nagging complications that, as a listener, you can’t help but empathize with, as he questions his love and finds no stable solution. In this song, a rhythm guitar lays the foundation as Shauf’s vocals are tied with strings and a steady electric guitar. On the seventh song, “To You,” he reveals a love-confession gone wrong. Wind instruments dominate this track while Andy reveals what can happen when emotionally charged scenarios spiral out of control — in this case, for the awkward. He leaves the song with the classic “forget I even mentioned it” as the strings suddenly cut and lead us into the final three songs on the album. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The eighth song “Eyes of Them All” is a mini love song about the girl at the party who’s dancing in the center of the room, without a care in the world. A damp tambourine and high keys combine on the chorus to create my favorite moment on the album; outshining bliss in the overwhelming tides of social anxiety. In the sea of all the problems, discomfort, and unanswered questions, the listener escapes, dances and smiles for four minutes. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The ninth cut “Alexander All Alone” takes a dark turn that puts the listener on edge. A loud piano key tapped for three and half minutes is joined by another diverse Shauf arrangement. Shauf documents the end of a lonely smoker’s life with eerie vocals to create a distinct timbre that isolates the track.

That’s why Annie Rimmon, also known as DJ Sorta Gourmet, has dedicated her show to it. Fine Dining invites chefs, restaurateurs and even chocolate specialists to engage in a discussion about some of the most delicious foods and recipes that will make your mouth water. From Italian-Jewish descent, Rimmon says that cuisine has always been a big part of her family - “the kitchen table was the center of my home, where my family would eat a deliciously cooked meal prepared by my mom every night.” This and her growing interest in the culinary arts after studying abroad in Florence serve as inspiration for her show. Rimmon’s enthusiasm about food is contagious, so I had to ask what the three food items would be if she needed to shoot, marry or make love to each of them. She answered with glazed salmon, bolognese pasta and English toffee, respectively. To find out why, catch the show on Fridays at 9 AM for some sweet and savory sounds of flavor!

Besides UCLA Radio, Charlotte is involved with ACM and the group WATT for women in electrical engineering. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMadison Feldman\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eMadison Feldman is a second year student in the promotions department, although she is looking to contribute to UCLA Radio in many different ways.

I can’t reflect back on my time in college without stumbling upon memories of afternoons in the radio station, co-hosting shows with my close friends, and of course, hours and hours spent behind the mic - and I wouldn’t have it any other way. I’ve been here since the beginning of my college career and I’ll remain in the station until the day I graduate. Now, nearly two years after I first became a part of radio, I sit in a corner of the station, typing away and reflecting on my time as a DJ. The part college radio has played in my life has changed many times over, but it’s easy for me to say that regardless of what radio has meant to me, it’s been one the most meaningful experiences of my college career.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2048\" data-orig-height=\"1365\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4b2b0027e617d7ba65fc117d7991ee33/tumblr_inline_op9d984Jpt1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2048\" data-orig-height=\"1365\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eI remember the first time I stepped into the radio station, hidden in the corner of Ackerman. Inside, every square inch of the white walls, even the ceiling, was filled with band stickers and the inner musings of past DJs. The chalkboard was overflowing with the scribbles and doodles of station members. Lines and lines of CDs filled the wooden bookshelves. A large old couch in a worn black slipcover occupied one corner. Music floated from the DJ booth, where two decrepit stools in the most atrocious shade of orange I’d ever witnessed were illuminated by the glowing lights of the soundboard. Even with the mere fifteen of us interns who had come to visit the station, the small space was feeling more than cozy. The station was tiny, most everything was in need of replacement, and it was more than I could ever hope for. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"2048\" data-orig-width=\"1365\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c502baf770a212f46962a07c168c06b0/tumblr_inline_opamnkvLDx1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"2048\" data-orig-width=\"1365\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first time I spoke on air was terrifying. It was as if I’d never heard my own voice aloud before. I became suddenly self conscious of how I sounded as I racked my brain with something significant enough to say on air, and in the end all I came up with was “Hey guys!” - which at the time felt like the most mediocre phrase ever uttered in the English language. I remember how my voice sounded so loud. I imagined my words echoing out into a void of other sound waves, hoping it reached any listeners out there far, far away. And yet the act of speaking felt so intimate, even though I couldn’t see the people I was talking to. The uniqueness of that connection was captivating.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2048\" data-orig-height=\"1365\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/af2b62163704c74748daf62c7879b494/tumblr_inline_op9dfbq6c01qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2048\" data-orig-height=\"1365\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course there was the music. It’s as if I’d forgotten how powerful a song could be. How unparalleled the rush of walking into the station was knowing I had a really \u003cb\u003egood\u003c/b\u003e set for that day. There were nights when I danced alone after other DJs had long abandoned the booth before remembering the station cameras were on. There was the time I sat in front of the mic at 9 a.m., quietly digging my nails into my palm to stop myself from crying when I played “What a Wonderful World” by Louis Armstrong for my grandmother, who had died five days earlier. Hearing the songs I played on air became an entirely new way of listening to music. It’s a communal experience, the thrill of sharing with someone the music you love like it was a piece of yourself. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2048\" data-orig-height=\"1365\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/575b6af069e27c7a7c19cea243563d3b/tumblr_inline_op9dbmtn2x1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2048\" data-orig-height=\"1365\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eRadio is so many things. It’s four people crammed into one booth with not enough headphones to go around, crowding in to share a mic, poking fun at other DJs and arguing about which track to play next. It’s just you in the booth, late at night, with the music cranked up as loud as it can go to keep you company. It’s that brief silence when you turn off the mic and fade in the song you’ve been dying to play all week. Here at UCLA Radio, it’s our 200+ members and the nearly 100 unique radio shows we host. And most importantly, it’s the people who support us each year to make sure we can continue as a college radio station. Today marks the beginning of our annual Pledge Drive. As a 100 percent student run station that features original programming without advertisements on air, we depend on the support of our listeners to continue running. You are the reason we are able to see the many different meanings of radio, and we hope you can help us discover many new understandings.

    "content": "\u003cp\u003eWritten By : Lillian Stanwick \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePost Date : 04/27/17\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1200\" data-orig-width=\"1200\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fc46591bfb19497bd1b7acd3e7809717/tumblr_inline_op3ia9kqlx1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1200\" data-orig-width=\"1200\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eI could easily see Stella Donnelly\u0026rsquo;s new EP, Thrush Metal, becoming the sort of debut album that is underestimated by its audience and then quickly forgotten. This would be an incredible misfortune. Thrush Metal’s composition is simple; each song features Stella\u0026rsquo;s voice, accompanied by a single guitar. However, the messages and themes woven into the lyrics of Donnelly\u0026rsquo;s tunes are far from simple. In today\u0026rsquo;s era of over-produced music, it is easy to dismiss simple acoustic tunes as ‘unimaginative.’ Our ears have been trained by recent pop music to crave songs with synthesizers, mellotrons, and additional post-production sounds. That\u0026rsquo;s not to say that these new, heavily mixed songs are inherently bad. UCLA\u0026rsquo;s Radio\u0026rsquo;s recent profile of CUCO highlighted an artist who has skillfully produced music that takes advantage of this trend and produced high-quality albums. However, given the shift towards production-heavy music of the past five to ten years, it has become reasonable —albeit falsely — for listeners to assume that a lack of manufactured sound entails a lack of creativity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis view not only dismisses great singer-songwriters, past albums (such as a favorite of mine, Karen O\u0026rsquo;s Crush Songs), but it also makes it all too easy to overlook excellent albums that released recently. Stella Donnelly\u0026rsquo;s Thrush Metal is one such great album, and I honestly hope that it is not so easily missed. The opening track, \u0026ldquo;Mechanical Bull,\u0026rdquo; is the most popular song from the album. The lyrics about ditching a suffocating lover are at once forceful and fragile — revealing both the annoyance experienced in unsatisfying relationships, as well as the aching emptiness of deciding that one is better off alone. It\u0026rsquo;s no surprise that this track has resonated with the widest audience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut “Mechanical Bull” is not the track that stands out the most to me. Instead, it\u0026rsquo;s the following song, \u0026ldquo;Boys Will Be Boys.\u0026rdquo; This one is the most stirring, since it references the language that promotes rape culture. The first few lines of the first verse are painful, haunting, almost, and they set a heavy tone for the rest of the song: \u0026ldquo;My friend told me of a secret/Told me that she blames herself/You invaded her magnificence/Put your hand over her mouth.\u0026rdquo; On first glance, the phrase \u0026ldquo;invaded her magnificence\u0026rdquo; seems like an odd euphemism to use. It\u0026rsquo;s awkward, and almost makes the listener squirm a bit. But this feeling of discomfort is necessary. Rape culture is supposed to make you uncomfortable. You should be bothered by these ‘alternative terms’ that are used to downplay heinous sex crimes. Donnelly\u0026rsquo;s song continues with more of these common justifications, \u0026ldquo;Why was she all alone?/Wearing her shirt that low.\u0026rdquo; These weak excuses create a feeling of disgust in the listener. By the time Donnelly first cries out \u0026ldquo;They said boys will be boys,\u0026rdquo; you\u0026rsquo;re angry that a culture that accepts such insubstantial justifications has been allowed to persist for so long.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe last three songs on the album are far less pointed. \u0026ldquo;Mean to Me\u0026rdquo; calls back to \u0026ldquo;Mechanical Bull\u0026rdquo; in that it details the experience of being in a physically and emotionally draining relationship. It effectively shows off Donnelly\u0026rsquo;s skills as a storyteller, lyricist and singer. \u0026ldquo;Grey\u0026rdquo; is a similar song, similarly detailing a relationship that is self-deprecating. Do these songs discuss the same relationship? It\u0026rsquo;s possible, but the songs seem too distinct to be about the same person.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, the EP closes with \u0026ldquo;A Poem,\u0026rdquo; which is metaphorically heavy. Donnelly croons to a simple strum pattern, as she plays out the EP. It\u0026rsquo;s a fine ending to a brief (18-minute) collection of songs. Stella Donnelly\u0026rsquo;s debut is a strong one, and it shows great promise for future releases. I just hope that today\u0026rsquo;s listeners will not overlook this artist\u0026rsquo;s stripped down sound in an age where highly produced tunes are best sellers.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

It departs from their earlier psychedelic, glam pop influences and embarks on a more energetic pop vibe. The album seems fresh and bright, however it struggles with identity and falls short of expectations after the second half.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe album starts off with the pop banger “Kaleidoscope.” It is a great start to the album with your regular pop sounds of the summer. It differs because the music has more depth to it on the background with vocal effects and unique keyboard riffs. The lyrics do not offer much but you don’t expect it to. It is fun and refreshing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second song “On Top” follows the same themes but with the addition of 90s pop vibes. Just like “Night Time TV” following it, the song is filled with funky instruments and a banging chorus. Both these songs sound like they could be played in a club because of their ambient sounds and surprisingly are the two best songs off the album, even though they’re not singles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second hit off the album, “Conversation,” unfolds as a better “Kaleidoscope.” The powerful piano with the claps and electro pop drums is reminiscent of Foster the People’s Torches and delivers a fresh sound. It has everything that a hit song needs and succeeds in becoming one of the most memorable songs of the album.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe album has two instrumental intervals called “Zilla I” \u0026amp; “Zilla II.” They are overall very good instrumentals with deep sounds and voice effects. Considering the whole album though, they do not represent much and does not fit the theme. “Zilla I” feels like a pause between “Conversation” and “Grace” rather than a cohesive transition between the two songs. “Zilla II” on the other hand, while more lively, fails to add depth to the album.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFollowing “Zilla I,” the album starts to lose its energy and novelty. While “Grace” adds a difference with its explosive beginning and calm guitar ending, there is too much going on in the song. “Cold Light” and “Undercover” drop down the tempo with an attempt at romance but falls short of their promises and comes off as unexciting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe three ending songs, “Touch,” “Be Someone,” and “From Afar,” have the same formula that the brothers used in the entire album with the same electronic build up followed by uninspiring lyrics. Unfortunately, the same sounds that seem fresh at the beginning start to feel old mostly because apart from the music, the album conceptually does not have much to offer. Fenech-Soler embarked upon a new musical journey for themselves with \u003ci\u003eZilla\u003c/i\u003e, but they still have a long way to go before they find their identity.\u003c/p\u003e",

Both of these records have allowed them to tour and play shows and festivals internationally. Before Circa Waves’ headlining show in Los Angeles at the Teragram Ballroom, I spoke with two of the band’s members - lead singer and guitarist Kieran Shudall and guitarist Joe Falconer - about the band’s latest stateside tour, their new album, songwriting, and more!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWell first\u0026hellip;this year has been pretty exciting for you. Your album came out, \u003ci\u003eDifferent Creatures\u003c/i\u003e, and you’re back in the States for a tour - how does it feel to be back in the States and to be touring?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKieran:\u003c/b\u003e It’s really cool, I mean, I think there’s a sort of history of British bands coming over to America, and it feels very much like we’re just sort of following the footsteps of so many other bands who’ve made history over here. So it feels sort of like we’re in a movie - and we’re like the heroes of the film and we’re trying to conquer America and bring British rock ‘n’ roll to the people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eI see that, ‘cause you’ve been making waves in America! More and more people are starting to know who you are.\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKieran:\u003c/b\u003e I hope so, yeah. It’s hard to know from where, from you know, the thousands of miles away that we are.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJoe:\u003c/b\u003e I think we’ve noticed it on the East Coast and stuff that we’ve done, like more people have been coming back to shows and shows, and people sort of like know the music a bit more, it’s not just curiosity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eYeah, I can see the big difference. I was at a show in Santa Ana two years ago, and people were just starting to know you. But now, they actually know the lyrics. That must be a good feeling.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKieran: \u003c/b\u003eIt’s great yeah, it’s like validation for all the hard work you put in I suppose. I always like to hear American people singing my songs - it kind of makes them sound better \u003ci\u003e*laughs*\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat’s been a highlight of the stateside tour so far?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKieran:\u003c/b\u003e Mercury Lounge was pretty cool.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJoe:\u003c/b\u003e Mercury Lounge. I thought Philadelphia was one of my favorites on this tour. We’ve been there a couple of times but we’ve never done a headline show in Philadelphia. It was our first ever one, and yeah, it was just one of those ones where it felt like the people, like we brought people from the support shows we did - it was like a Monday night or something.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKieran:\u003c/b\u003e Also we went out to this cool bar where we played and - what’s that ball thing called?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJoe:\u003c/b\u003e Skee-ball?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKieran:\u003c/b\u003e We played skee-ball all night and got really hammered, so that was also a highlight. I discovered that I get better at skee-ball the more beer I drink. So, now I know that. I know what to do touring next time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWell in terms of your records, \u003ci\u003eDifferent Creatures\u003c/i\u003e sounds pretty different from \u003ci\u003eYoung Chasers\u003c/i\u003e. They both still sound like Circa Waves records, but I guess were you sort of afraid to change the sonic direction of \u003ci\u003eDifferent Creatures\u003c/i\u003e to this more heavier sound?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKieran:\u003c/b\u003e I think we just sort of went with our gut really. I mean, I think the songs are still pop songs, but we just turned the distortion up a little bit, and that fear sort of quickly goes away when you first play them live, and people you know, lose their minds to it and stuff, it’s really great. So, yeah I don’t feel like it was a mistake. I think it worked out pretty well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDo you find that some songs translate better live than they do on the record?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKieran: \u003c/b\u003eThey’re all pretty great live \u003ci\u003e*laughs* \u003c/i\u003eI mean the record was sort of, even though it’s layered and stuff, it’s still pretty much just the four of us. There’s not too much going on in terms of - we don’t have loads of like synths or like magical noises, I mean there’s a few magical noises. But, generally it’s still just four guys sort of playing instruments. So live, it really plays to that, but it’s just got, you know we’ve bought bigger amps, got big bad guitars, so everything’s bigger and bolder and is sort of ready for stadiums - if they’ll have us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DLSlVRkq61eo\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LSlVRkq61eo?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2\u003eLooking at the “Fire That Burns” video, I noticed that there’s a lot of red imagery - there’s a lot of red objects and it’s dominated by red lighting. And also, the \u003ci\u003eDifferent Creatures\u003c/i\u003e album cover is red, so what does the color red signify for you?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKieran: \u003c/b\u003eIt’s just a really, it’s just like it’s sexy, it’s blood, it’s love, it’s life, it just seems to be, it’s the most striking color for anything I think. And we watched, there’s a film called \u003ci\u003eMean Streets\u003c/i\u003e, which is like a Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro seventies movie - I mean I go to this bar downstairs and there’s a thing in the film like it’s a weird kind of thing, this bar, and the whole bar is shot in this really blood-red sort of lit thing, and I just remember seeing that and thinking, “That would be an amazing concept for an album.” And so we just sort of pushed that through the whole thing. And it’s funny to watch that and go like, “Oh, that’d be a cool idea,” and now you’re in you know, LA, and someone goes, “You’ve done everything red, why was that?” and you go, “Oh fuck, that was just a silly idea one day we had.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe video’s also pretty cinematic.

The festival is located in the desert valley of Bradley, CA where the mountainous grounds are alive and resemble what I imagine the moon’s gravel to look like. I had heard good rumors about LiB, and I was very excited to experience the festival for myself. I attended the festival with a large group of fellow UCLA students, and we set up camp in Lot 3, which was a 15 minute walk away from the festival grounds. On Thursday morning, we grounded our tents and EZ-Ups in a communal fashion, settling into our new home for the next few days. Everyone’s excitement and joy for the festival was palpable. Smiles were contagious and high fives were ubiquitous. Many of the camp members had already been to the festival before. For many of us, it was our very first time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2048\" data-orig-height=\"1367\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a1a6fa68b32ca1834a21090f88c892f5/tumblr_inline_or36fpJ78O1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2048\" data-orig-height=\"1367\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eEntering the festival, my eyes were captivated by the colorful and natural landscape. The lake had risen to 50 percent capacity, and the water glimmered under the sun’s rays. Large stages were rooted on different hills of the festival grounds. Each one acquired a distinct color scheme and design. All were very DoLaB-esque, well-executed and perfect for dancing. The festival grounds were connected by bridges. The bridges on the high grounds were narrow and stable for walking. Others were afloat on the lake and playfully wobbled to the march of the crowd’s steps. The floating bridges required quite a bit of trust, in both your own ability to balance and others to reassure you that no one would make sudden movements, resulting in a crash into the water. On the lake, there were motor-powered, bohemian-styled docs, enabling mobility across the waters. Festival-goers jumped onto these decorated rafts with friends, having dance parties on the lake.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2000\" data-orig-height=\"1335\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2ba541ae6ed23c04ff060c300e7c725c/tumblr_inline_or36fdj8jf1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2000\" data-orig-height=\"1335\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe people of LiB were magical, often dressed in free-flowing fashion with outrageous colors. Weird costumes were welcomed and even encouraged. Others opted for functional outfits that were able to endure the fickle weather. The mornings and afternoons were warm, often reaching upwards of 80 degrees. Nights were colder and plummeted down to the 40-50s. It was manageable with a mid-day change in clothes, and I enjoyed the weather for the most part. Sometimes there were strong winds that did not help with the massive amounts of dust and dirt. To manage the dusty winds, it was imperative to wear a headscarf or breathing masks. I had some fun with this, and I packed a variety of colorfully patterned headbands that I wrapped around my mouth and nose. This helped tremendously, but dirt was impossible to avoid. At the end of every day, my body would be covered in dirt. Even my nose would be stuffed; however, this was a small cost to pay for the amount of joy I was having.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2000\" data-orig-height=\"1335\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/eb674cdbdfea8bef42e9b6302c7d78d3/tumblr_inline_or36g8WCbq1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2000\" data-orig-height=\"1335\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eI participated in a variety of LiB activities. Some of my favorites were held at Yoga Sol, Mediation Mountain, and Sound Bath. Yoga Sol was a yoga class, led by a professional instructor. Meditation Mountain provided an atmospheric sanctuary for those who desired to meditate or chant in a communal and guided space. It overlooked the festival grounds, and the view was unforgettable. I peered out at the festive tents, architectural structures, crowds, and landscape and felt overwhelmed by their beauty. The festival took the form of a small village. The scene was cathartic. Furthermore, the Sound Bath was an ethereal experience. Fortunately, my friends and I caught the last session of the day. The class was held under a giant tree and its large branches and leaves overarched the class, providing shade. Participants laid beneath the tree. Instructors told us to close our eyes, while they gently played the gongs. The sound filled the air. Throughout the session, instructors used a collection of sound makers, such as a rainstick, triangle and didgeridoo. Nothing could have explained it better than the name itself- a sound bath.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2000\" data-orig-height=\"1335\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/03ab5e5099edf938e1ac85ff40775d0f/tumblr_inline_or36gpwZcL1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2000\" data-orig-height=\"1335\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe festival’s activities were great for the daytime when you were looking for a break in between performances. The music at LiB is almost exclusively electronic; however, basically every type of electronica was present. My favorite artists were Miss Cooper and Her Pet Craigslist Hookup, NomBe, Kaytranada, Big Wild, Brasstracks, Elohim, Bassnectar, Paper Diamond, and Troyboi. One of my favorite aspects about the festival is the sheer freedom of the lineup. Many of the DJs at Lightning were more established within the electronic realm; therefore, many were not as familiarized. Still, they were all amazing. When I did not know the name of the artist, I let the music carry me. If I heard something I enjoyed, I was there. This really allowed me to have a good time without having to stress about who I was seeing at every moment. I was discovering new music in the purest form of live execution. Yet, I was still able to see of the more established artists who blew me away.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2048\" data-orig-height=\"1152\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3c08122335d15585f4f72300c6185dd0/tumblr_inline_or36h75udi1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2048\" data-orig-height=\"1152\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the end, Lightning in a Bottle was a festival of its own species. The festival-goers’ easy-going attitudes, coupled with their enthusiasm and mutual respect, made the musical experience a special one. Furthermore, the vibrant aura of the place that shined in its color and creativity left me in fascination. The music was insatiable. I’d like to think that this festival allowed me to dance to the beat of my own drum; however, it would be false to say so for I had an amazing communal experience, feeling love and joy for those around me. I often joke to my friends that every festival experience changes me. The truth to that statement could not be more real, as Lightning in a Bottle has definitely made its imprint on me. As soon as I arrived to the comfort of my home, I texted everyone I knew and said, “Can’t wait for next year!”\u003c/p\u003e",

Nothing here suggests traumatizing typeface with loose tracking nor translating brands of coconut water into katakana. There aren’t any gradient grids signifying some MNC-controlled Matrix. I don’t hear supermarkets. No, this ain’t that kind of poetry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite all of its sonic nods to  a e s t h e t i c, Budgie’s \u003ci\u003ePanty Soakers 3\u003c/i\u003e is an appropriation of Japanese funk done with love. Unlike most tracks sampled by the vaporwave factory, the Japanese rarities presented here don’t undergo too much stretching nor are they drowned out in delay and reverb. Budgie lets his picks play for themselves, as in his “Infatuation,” where Masayoshi Takanaka’s “Struttin On Broadway” remains virtually untouched. Any manipulation he does to a song offers up a new idea that ultimately makes the experience of the album incredibly dynamic; thus, no track overstays its welcome. That being said, the entirety of the album plays out in 35 minutes, no song passing the four-minute mark. The tracklist traverses glassy cerebral ballads with “The Vapors” to the midnight funk of “Lighter,” ending with the Nilsson-esque sunlight of “Just Hit.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePanty\u003c/i\u003e mixes together an incredibly cohesive blend of Japanese funk that no one else has the brains to blend. Thus, given the incredible eclecticism of his DJ mixes, it’s no surprise that DJ, beatmaker, and producer Budgie practically grew up in London’s Honest Jon’s, a record store that his father runs. Budgie notably started digging for gospel records (His mixes, compiled on \u003ci\u003eThe Gospel According to Budgie I \u0026amp; II\u003c/i\u003e, inspired a Kanye West sample on \u003ci\u003eYeezus\u003c/i\u003e, and are definitely worth checking out.) Thankfully, he kept up the search. His dive into Japanese music further testifies to the tasteful genius of the crate digger. After all, what’s the point of an aesthete when you’ve got a DJ?\u003c/p\u003e",

If you don’t know Crossed Out I definitely recommend checking out their split with Man is The Bastard, as well as their 1990-1993 discography. Very good stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStarting with the first track “Callahan”, the listener can immediately tell that Captain Howdy sticks to their old school powerviolence roots. Ditching the sludge-centric style of more modern bands in the genre, Captain Howdy is loud, fast and aggressive. The thing that stands out to me most is the song lengths. Crossed Out rarely wrote songs over a minute (most being around 40 seconds or less), yet songs on this demo (such as the title track) reach up to six minutes in length. This is not a bad thing, however, as Captain Howdy is able to constantly engage their listeners and switch songs up enough to keep them entertaining. I did not find myself bored a single time throughout this album, and this is coming for a guy with an attention span that seldom lasts longer than a minute. The band seamlessly switches between blast beat driven segments, to hardcore inspired yelps and killer breakdowns. “Hell” is a great example of this, beginning with guitar reminiscent of early hardcore acts like Stalag 13, and then quickly transitions into a punishing breakdown. This is all followed by an almost death metal esque guitar segment over which the vocalist angrily shouts. The chorus is also very catchy, a word that I feel is not the most appropriate when talking about powerviolence, but it is 5 am on a Friday, so cut me some slack.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll in all, this release is solid. It’s everything you would expect from a hardcore/powerviolence mesh featuring members of Crossed Out — loud, angry, fast and engaging. While this isn’t exactly a life changing release, it is definitely one I would recommend to fans of the genre as I think it has a lot to offer. If you enjoy it, be sure to catch Captain Howdy live at 1Fest LA this June 3.\u003c/p\u003e",

What makes you different from the average sports reporter?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI feel that it is important to interview these athletes because in my mind, most are polarized from the rest of the student body. UCLA is known for having a rich history of dominant sports teams and I believe that these athletes represent more than that. I want to provide an outlet for these athletes where they are comfortable enough to express themselves fully. There is so much more underneath the jersey.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSince you’ve had so many different people come and talk on your show, have you noticed any common values or characteristics that your guests all seem to have in common?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eHumility. Under the media microscope, so many professional and even college athletes are cast as arrogant individuals who are only successful because of their physical gifts. I have found the exact opposite is true. Each athlete is beyond humble to attend UCLA and be a part of a community where academics is stressed so heavily. Even with all of their accolades, they constantly remind me of how lucky they are.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eIs there anything that guests have brought up that surprised you about their lives or life outlook?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eStarting late in the game. What I mean by that is I have had quite a few athletes pursue the current sport they are playing at an older age. I found this incredibly impressive as they were able to develop extraordinary skills in such a short amount of time. UCLA is a Division I school, therefore all of these athletes perform at a higher level than most, so when they tell me that they started playing in high school it boggles my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eLet’s say you’re assembling a dream heist team—think the Avengers or the crew from \u003ci\u003eFast and Furious\u003c/i\u003e.

Not only could he eloquently talk his way out of any sticky situation, but I think he has some connections that we could certainly utilize. While El Chapo has been officially caught, he would definitely be the mastermind behind all of our heists. Lastly, one of the best climbers in the world by the name of Alex Honnold would make infiltration of any building look easy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-height=\"640\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/54e90b1285ecc803439acc4c9cd3bfe1/tumblr_inline_oq11snqArL1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-height=\"640\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat does the sauce mean to you? Similarly, what is your relationship with the sauce?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eSauce can mean quite a few things. When Gucci Mane first uttered the words, I believe he was referencing fame, money, and everything that comes with those two things. You can have all the fame and money in the world, but once it consumes you, then you’re lost according to Gucci. For me, sauce is a highly enjoyable moment in time. When I’m on air, I’m trying to get the most out of the moment and appreciate the conversation that I am having with my guest. Beyond radio, sauce can be going to the gym or hanging out with friends. If I love what I’m doing at a specific point in time, I am trying to get lost in it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat is one thing that people should know about you, your show, or both?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI thoroughly enjoy making people smile. That’s usually my goal throughout the entire show. Once a guest smiles, I know they are comfortable and a great conversation usually follows. It’s the same thing for my involvement with Special Olympics. I come to practice every week with the intention of having each athlete I interact with smile.

Before Diet Cig took the stage however, the already excited atmosphere of the room was boosted even more by the performances of two opening acts - Janelane and Lisa Prank.\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst up was Janelane, whose members were ecstatic to be playing at the Echo again. Led by singer and guitarist Sophia Negrini, the band’s set was energetic, and enthusiasm radiated from each of the musicians’ faces on stage. Everything about Janelane was a delight to watch and listen to, and their sound built up perfectly to match that of the next opening act.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLisa Prank, the second act of the night, delivered another exuberant set while telling jokes to make the audience laugh between songs. \u0026ldquo;They’re so hardworking,\u0026rdquo; Prank said after one song as she thanked her non-existent band and looked at an empty corner on stage. Comments like these were met with grins from the audience, who fully supported the one woman band in front of them. After Prank’s set, more chatter ensued among the crowd until Diet Cig walked on stage, smiling and waving. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"960\" data-orig-width=\"640\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c492d0b39eeaff35255da29bef8b125a/tumblr_inline_optlcpmjuU1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"960\" data-orig-width=\"640\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eExperiencing a Diet Cig show for the first time comes with a lot of emotions - there\u0026rsquo;s undoubtedly feelings of joy, lots of smiling, yelling, and even more dancing. Starting off with the song “Cardboard” off their 2015 EP \u003ci\u003eOver Easy\u003c/i\u003e, singer and guitarist Luciano immediately got the crowd moving and rocking their heads back and forth. After this song began, the crowd never stopped moving throughout the night - teens and adults alike loved every minute of the set, and jumped up and down as they sang along unapologetically to the lyrics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis concert was the first time Diet Cig got to play a Los Angeles show in support of their debut album \u003ci\u003eSwear I’m Good At This\u003c/i\u003e, which came out this past April. Filling their set with tracks from their older EPs and the new record, the crowd responded greatly to each song with equal amounts of enthusiasm. Crowd favorite “Barf Day” was an especially cathartic moment as everyone sang “I just want to have ice cream on my birthday/Blow the candles out and wish all of my pain away,” in unison. Even the stories and comments from Luciano between songs resonated with the crowd. One story included a humorous account on how the group\u0026rsquo;s LA Airbnb wasn\u0026rsquo;t as advertised. Long story short, the place they stayed in only had one lamp, so one member of the group\u0026rsquo;s tour crew pulled a clever prank on the Airbnb owner in response. Still, the duo made their way to Echo Park for the night, creating a positive, inclusive safe space for everyone at their show.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlbum highlights “Maid of the Mist” and “Leo” drew huge reactions from the audience, resulting in shouts for an encore at the end of the night, the chant “one more song, one more song!” hovering over the room. After a minute, Diet Cig, all smiles, ran back on stage to sing an encore of a few more songs. During the final  song ‘Harvard,’ Luciano threw confetti in the air as she jumped off drummer Bowman’s drum kit, and the crowd roared with applause.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"640\" data-orig-width=\"960\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a90e52c8362af27af2e2c8bec4897acd/tumblr_inline_optlbyoWUB1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"640\" data-orig-width=\"960\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, Diet Cig’s show was lots of fun. “I think being tender is a form of resistance,” Luciano commented as the duo moved towards the end of their set. Words like these were one of the many positive messages that permeated from the duo that night, and it was nice to attend a show where everyone on and off stage had a great time together. If Diet Cig are coming to a city near you, I would wholeheartedly recommend seeing them live.\u003c/p\u003e",

Jay Som’s sold-out performance on April 21 was no different, characterized by poignancy, personality, and a dreamy atmosphere.\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe night began with all-female high school-trio Pinky Pinky, as well as self-proclaimed bipolar folk band Kera and The Lesbians. Both bands were female-led, energetic, and utilized biting instrumentals and gritty vocals. It was one of the few occurrences where the show openers were not only worth showing up to, but also genuinely as enjoyable as the headliner. Both bands started off the night brilliantly, getting the audience to bob their head along with the beat, as well as complimenting the music of Jay Som later that night.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1333\" data-orig-width=\"2000\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dfaedb3213ec0ce3821c1768d7d66538/tumblr_inline_op58clZBhq1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1333\" data-orig-width=\"2000\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1314\" data-orig-width=\"1980\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b22e4e6fb67aef1c629ddfddc9aaa0b5/tumblr_inline_op58e8JRJ51qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1314\" data-orig-width=\"1980\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Melina Duarte first took stage that night with her three bandmates, fans excitedly whispered. There was no rushing to the front of the stage, pushing, or high-pitched screaming. Instead, there was a careful and quiet admiration that was present throughout the night. It was this quality of the audience that made the show seem even more like a personal house show or an individual peek into Duarte’s introspective lyrics, rather than a concert populated by mostly teenage and young adult fans. Throughout the night, the band mentioned the quietness of the audience with Duarte eventually saying, “You guys are so quiet… but I like it.” The band’s chemistry was also lovely to watch, as they moved around on stage, shot grins at each other, and even playfully switched hats throughout the show.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe personality of both the audience and the band fit in perfectly with Jay Som’s actual performance, as they focused on songs from their new album \u003ci\u003eEverybody Works\u003c/i\u003e. While their performance was guitar heavy and complimented Duarte’s glossy vocals, the crowd would at most sway together and bob their heads, eventually singing along to singles like “The Bus Song.” When the band played slower songs like “Baybee,” the crowd hushed and swayed, in accordance to the emotions Duarte was so brilliantly able to convey with only her voice. The night ended with a slowed-down version of one of Jay Som’s first releases, “I Think You’re Alright,” beginning with Duarte saying, “This one’s for the lovers in the audience.” Instantly the emotive atmosphere in the room switched to the feeling of an 80s prom slow dance, hitting the audience with both nostalgia and the poignancy of all the emotions Duarte conveyed that night.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1333\" data-orig-width=\"2000\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/29c40328184a155794bf49efd467e731/tumblr_inline_op58ciX1eT1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1333\" data-orig-width=\"2000\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eUltimately, the hype surrounding Jay Som as an emerging music group is deserved - not only for the quality of their latest album, but for their ability to perform on such a personal level, connecting with everyone in the audience. Even after the show, the band stuck around, going as far as hugging fans and making conversation. The openers of the night are also worth checking out in the future, whether that involves their discography or attending other shows in which they are playing. This concert was special on multiple levels, as it not only was predominantly led by strong, female artists, but also truly made the music private, intimate, and more emotive than simply listening to the album itself. This ability to truly connect with the audience makes Jay Som such a distinct presence in the new music scene, and a band to certainly keep an eye out for in the future.\u003c/p\u003e",

The night at The Roxy was meant to be a release show for the new album. \u003ci\u003eSomething More!\u003c/i\u003e has more pop intonations in it than the two previous albums WATERS has put out. The singles \u0026ldquo;Hiccups\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Stand By You\u0026rdquo; border on bubblegum pop, a quality I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily consider to be positive. With that in mind, I was apprehensive about their show, fearing that their set would be a hot mess of over-produced pop. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009When I arrived at The Roxy just before 10 p.m., synthpop artist NVDES was playing their song \u0026ldquo;I Want to Make Out at the Gay Club.\u0026rdquo; As someone who dislikes the use of synthesizers in almost any capacity, hearing the end of their set did little to appease my hesitations about the show. NVDES finished around 10 p.m., and the curtain was lowered on the stage to allow the crew to set up for WATERS. The audience stirred for around 15 minutes. It was quiet enough to have a conversation without raising your voice considerably. Many patrons headed to the bar to refill their drinks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009When the curtain rose at 10:15 p.m., the members of WATERS were already standing on stage, prepared to play, which was surprising; I think most were expecting a grand entrance of some sort. The crew had added bunches of colorful balloons to the stage as decoration. Keyboardist Sara Ann DaMert introduced the set by throwing a bouquet of flowers into the audience, giving the band a whimsical air.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/876f9a1602efa870d6c5e1dabd6b221c/tumblr_inline_oticma3fm01qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009WATERS opened with a song I didn\u0026rsquo;t recognize, probably off of their new album. The songs they played throughout the set were mostly from \u003ci\u003eSomething More! \u003c/i\u003eand their second album \u003ci\u003eWhat\u0026rsquo;s Real\u003c/i\u003e. However, the band hinted on Twitter before the show that they would be playing one song from their first album \u003ci\u003eOut in the Light\u003c/i\u003e. I was expecting them to play \u0026ldquo;For the One,\u0026rdquo; instead they played \u0026ldquo;O Holy Break of Day,\u0026rdquo; which I favor. I would say it was their strongest song of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009From\u003ci\u003e Something More!\u003c/i\u003e, the band played their more popular songs, including \u0026ldquo;Hiccups,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Molly is a Babe,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Something More,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Modern Dilemma,\u0026rdquo; and my personal favorite from the album, \u0026ldquo;You Don\u0026rsquo;t Know What You Want.\u0026rdquo; But I must say their verbal intro for \u0026ldquo;You Don\u0026rsquo;t Know What You Want\u0026rdquo; was rather paltry. \u0026ldquo;This is a song about someone who doesn\u0026rsquo;t know what they want,\u0026rdquo; frontman Van announced to the audience. However, I did like the way they approached their encore. \u0026ldquo;This is the part where we pretend to go off stage, and then you get really loud, so we come back onstage,\u0026rdquo; Van deadpanned. From What\u0026rsquo;s Real the band played \u0026ldquo;Got to My Head,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I Feel Everything,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Mom and Dad\u0026rsquo;s,\u0026rdquo; among others. I surprised they didn\u0026rsquo;t play fan favorite \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s Real,\u0026rdquo; and disappointed that they didn\u0026rsquo;t play one of my personal favorites, \u0026ldquo;Stupid Games.\u0026rdquo; \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ce6d43e961ec5cdeb007ff7d860bae9b/tumblr_inline_oticovUBe91qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Something that stood out to me throughout the night was DaMert\u0026rsquo;s rather dramatic performance. She was almost comically expressive, in one case imitating having hiccups as the band announced the song \u0026ldquo;Hiccups.\u0026rdquo; In another instance, she pulled on the back of her hair to mimic sinking as Van sang the lyric \u0026ldquo;feels like I\u0026rsquo;m always sinking,\u0026rdquo; during the song \u0026ldquo;Got to My Head.\u0026rdquo; Her playful expressions were almost over the top for the small venue. That, paired with her bedazzled makeup, gave her an almost clownish persona. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009WATERS\u0026rsquo; new album sounds like a work of playful pop, devoid of the austere tracks that they included on their first release, \u003ci\u003eOut in the Light\u003c/i\u003e. It\u0026rsquo;s a development that I do not prefer, but it has evidently found an audience among the bubbly patrons who attended The Roxy. Despite my slight dissatisfaction, I believe that their new album will grow their fan base and lead to more people attending their spirited live shows. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/364c5c8ef892b6c813e401338af744e1/tumblr_inline_oticr6HwW71qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

This comes as no surprise; he’s just released his seventh full-length album, \u003ci\u003eRocket\u003c/i\u003e, a critically acclaimed compilation worthy of all its praise. Originally a bedroom singer/songwriter releasing DIY songs on Bandcamp, Alex G has garnered a following across the country - I can most certainly vouch for Los Angeles. The anticipation is palpable through Cende’s energetic opening set and Japanese Breakfast’s dynamic follow-up. Alex’s first steps onstage elicit screams and blurry Snapchats from devoted fans (a sizeable group). There’s hype, and I can feel it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s hard to overstate the stylistic diversity Alex and his band bring to the stage. Songs like “Bobby” and “Proud,” two twangy, folk-inspired standouts from Rocket, contrast brilliantly with the hard-hitting screamer “Brick” and the jazzy, bass-heavy “Guilty.” Alternating between playing guitar and keyboard, Alex sings with an intimacy and an intensity that leaves me self-reflecting, thinking, damn, I know that feeling.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/015a842e041de4df7634155b445fdad3/tumblr_inline_orszz4BFU41qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eA crowd-pleaser in the most literal sense, Alex spends the last half of his over an hour long set playing requests from front-row fans. The inclusivity of the atmosphere is striking. It’s like hearing encore after encore, as each choice satisfies a different sect of eager fans. He takes us back years prior, playing “Boy” from\u003ci\u003e DSU\u003c/i\u003e and “Mary” from \u003ci\u003eTrick\u003c/i\u003e. Some fans around me can’t be stumped—they know every word. Alex bridges the gap between artist and audience effortlessly; it feels like I’ve been hanging out with him for the past hour. I’ll say this: next time Alex is in town, jump on those tickets.\u003c/p\u003e",

This time, his record is inspired by his contemporary Kendrick Lamar, as he attempts to tackle many topics across an hour and ten minute time span. His album is riddled with skits that try to piece together a story between an Adam persona and God. The entire project is ambitious within itself, as from afar it is extremely well meant in terms of Logic’s intent. However the lack of cohesion causes the album to feel extremely scattered and thin; certain lyrical moments on the record lack a stronger substance - perhaps the lyricist should have taken a bit more time with the pen when it came to remarks about race and equality. The moments in which Logic considers racial equality - for example on “Black Spiderman” - feel thinly based on the sole fact that the rapper decides to rap from distinct points of view on the song. By switching scopes, Logic does not use the track as a means to push for equality in an analytical way. The notions and sentiments that Logic expresses on the track are pushed by his desire for there to be love, equality, understanding and hope between people of different creeds and colors. This is not something to loathe or specifically criticize in a review, but something around the topic begs for a little more dissection. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSomething that Logic will undoubtedly be criticized for is his lack of cohesion when placed in comparison with other rappers that have successfully released “conscious” albums that touch on race and equality, such as Lamar. However, when looking at Logic’s work as a sole piece of art that exists sans-\u003ci\u003eTo Pimp a Butterfly\u003c/i\u003e, the good nature of the album shines as something that will undoubtedly keep Logic popular, well-loved, and appreciated by his fans. However, this is, once again, not too say that his message is always well structured and well-layered. He sings, “I just wanna spread the message of equality,” on “Take It Back,” and then proceeds to describe his growing up in a racist household despite being biracial. Logic also explains how he grew up in a home filled with narcotics and how he went to school being told that he wouldn’t amount to anything because he was a “cracker” despite being biracial. One could say that this entire explanation would be more effective and enjoyable as a verse rather than a spoken word piece. He ends with the phrase “stop killing each other,” and it is something that would, once again, be more potent, more memorable, and more musically appealing if it were delivered in the manner of a verse. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe track “America” is one of the moments on the record in which everyone’s passions blaze through a steady, boom bap, bouncing bass instrumental in a captivating and fiery way. Most of the bars on this track are potent, focused, and prove to be some of the best lyrical moments of the entire record. Black Thoughts and Logic steal and hold the show, respectively, on this track and it is animpressive moment on the record. There is a moment on “Ink Blot” in which Juicy J appears and seems to be talking directly to fake individuals, fake rappers, and “trappers”; the guest rapper tells them all to “kill yourselves” and one could feel that this point on the record is extremely hypocritical to the entire message of the album (that of love, hope, and positivity). Anyone could think that a simple “fuck you” would have been sufficient to get the point across, but to directly tell somebody to kill themselves, no matter how foul or purposely ignorant and enraging they may be, is a very strong sentiment to be tossed around.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DsxjC4CNG3_c\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sxjC4CNG3_c?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the ninth track, “Waiting Room,” listeners are reminded that there is an entire skit and undercover story being told throughout the record. Neil DeGrasse Tyson plays the God character that explains how everybody is connected to each other, that all humans are interconnected and that every act of hatred is one done to one’s self, just as every act of love is one done to one’s self. It is a difficult concept to completely grasp, but the message comes relatively out of the blue after a set of eight tracks that jump from topics of personal growth to the current state of racial relations in USA to critiques of the music industry and social media. On “1-800-273-8255,” Logic and Alessia Cara come together in an extremely heart warming, melodically inspiring way to craft a song that deals with depression and the desire to complete suicide. The instrumental, from the softly arranged strings to the somber piano, as well as the vocals and content in the verses, all shine together. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis same sensation carries onto the next track, “Anziety,” a track that deals with the depression’s worrisome counterpart. However, this track concludes with a similar verse-less ending and Logic speaking about a personal experience that is powerful. Again, if this had been delivered in a verse rather than a personal anecdote, the song would have been much more memorable and honest. One could take this track as a personal speech, and many might not find the same issue. Logic’s honesty in regards to mental health is still something to be in awe of. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, Logic makes a sincere attempt to tackle a lot of topics within a small span of an hour. His attempts are honest and brief, but the overall lush presentation of the record allows for the record to be an enjoyable listen. The rapper should be appreciated for the attempt, and not criticized for falling short of his contemporaries’ achievements. Logic has certainly come into his own lane, and the peace, love and positivity that he pushes forward with each record is more resonant and vibrant than ever before on this LP.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e7/10\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

I had the pleasure of attending Marling’s LA show at the Mayan Theater during her U.S. promotion of the new album (Marling is from the UK). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’d seen Marling perform once before, at Outside Lands Music Festival. She’s a notoriously subdued performer, and I was too far away to really hear her sound, so I didn’t think much of it. This time was totally different. I’d fallen in love with Marling’s music, and had begun to understand the quiet but fierce poetry of her sound. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe show was held at the Mayan, a uniquely kitschy space. True to its name, it seemed like a Disney theme park Indiana Jones ride. Marling chuckled to herself a few songs into her set in acknowledgment of the decor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe crowd was loud and bustling, an eager excitement throughout the space, but as soon as the stand up bass began to crescendo for the opening tune of Marling’s first song, \n\n“Soothing” - one off her new album - a hush fell over the audience. She played three songs in a row, barely a breath in between, and the audience stood almost entirely still (except the occasional swaying), eyes cast towards the stage, mesmerized by her angelic presence. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMarling’s voice is technically perfect. She hits every note with ease, and adds beautiful vocal riffs to already complex songs, simultaneously playing hauntingly rich melodies on her guitar. All the while, she stands almost entirely still, and sometimes stares up at something we cannot see. At the risk of sounding trite, it’s a religious experience. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMarling has the captivating gentility of Aphrodite; the fierce wit of Athena. She is indeed a goddess. My camera can’t seem to focus on her because of the bright white light that she emits (a reflection off of her milk-colored hair, no doubt). She’s accompanied by a full band, who all stare at her reverentially while she sings, as awestruck as we are. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can’t help but feel romantic when you listen to Marling croon. Couples wrap their arms around each other; single people wrap their arms around themselves. At one point, Marling’s band exits the stage, and it’s just us and her. Her band is wonderful, especially her celestial back up singers, whose clear sweet voices highlight Marling’s soulful, throaty one, but she doesn’t need them. Her voice and her guitar fill up the room. My friend and I muse to each other about the miracle of such a loud sound coming from such a tiny person. Her guitar is inexplicably voluminous. She plays a medley of three old songs, including two of my favorites, “Salinas” and “Don’t Ask Me Why.” I can’t help but feel my eyes prick with tears. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen they come back, she allows us a bit of stage banter, quipping, partially to herself, that she always gets criticized for not engaging with the audience enough. She won’t do an encore, she says - she doesn’t do that. Indeed, she doesn’t, and slips off the stage quietly to thunderous applause. But the audience doesn’t mind, and I see only smiles and the occasional tear on the faces flooding out of the theater. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have a chance to speak to Marling for a moment after the show, and she is as ethereal in person as she is on stage. I thank her for the incredible performance, and she smiles at me, reserved but appreciatory. I listen to \u003ci\u003eSemper Femina \u003c/i\u003eexclusively for the next three days, looking forward the next time I have the chance to see her perform.\u003c/p\u003e",

Some songs on the album play like open letters to the couple\u0026rsquo;s infant daughter, especially the opening track \u0026ldquo;Welcome to Your Life.\u0026rdquo; \u003ci\u003eLittle Mess \u003c/i\u003edraws on this pre-established motif by beginning in a similar fashion. \u0026ldquo;Tell Me a Story\u0026rdquo; is slow and endearing. The chorus plays, \u0026ldquo;So tell me a story/Well, I\u0026rsquo;m in no hurry/I lay my head down/Against our baby now,\u0026rdquo; an apparent reference to Zucconi and Hooper\u0026rsquo;s new parenthood.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009\u0026ldquo;Torso\u0026rdquo; follows, bringing with it an eery riff and dreamy lyrics. The song sounds as if it was plucked straight from a Grouplove concert set list by including many of the same features that have come to define the band\u0026rsquo;s sound. The keen listener will notice the Pixies reference to \u0026ldquo;Velouria.\u0026rdquo; Next is \u0026ldquo;MRI.\u0026rdquo; Hooper takes lead vocals on this track. The song radiates a subtle, warm positivity. It is not an in-your-face \u0026ldquo;look on the bright side\u0026rdquo; sort of uplifting track that is standard fare on most pop albums. Instead, it acknowledges the struggles, the \u0026ldquo;darkest hours\u0026rdquo; in our lives, but follows this with gentle encouragement to recognize the people who love us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DEfIXw6__aT8\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EfIXw6__aT8?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009I would have been disappointed to have seen a live version of a song on this album — had it been anything other than \u0026ldquo;Enlighten Me.\u0026rdquo; Often, I feel like live albums are just afterthought productions forced out by record labels. In most instances, the sound quality of the recorded performances is shoddy, leading listeners back to the original album. Grouplove\u0026rsquo;s \u003ci\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m With You\u003c/i\u003e did not explicitly contain these characteristics, but I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t deem it a necessary part of their discography. The live version of \u0026ldquo;Enlighten Me\u0026rdquo; is distinct enough from the recorded version to secure a warranted spot on the EP. The band has historically used \u0026ldquo;Enlighten Me\u0026rdquo; to introduce their encores. Towards the end of the shows they played for the Big Mess Tour, the majority of the band members would exit the stage, leaving Zucconi as the sole performer, armed with an acoustic guitar and illuminated by a single beam of light. He would then slowly begin to strum and croon out \u0026ldquo;Enlighten Me.\u0026rdquo; Eventually, the other members would return to the stage to bang out the end of the song in a heartbeat-accelerating crescendo.  On the album, an echoing piano plays instead of Zucconi\u0026rsquo;s guitar, thus differentiating the live version from the studio track. For these reasons, the inclusion of a live version of \u0026ldquo;Enlighten Me\u0026rdquo; feels well thought out, and it contributes nicely to the rest of the EP.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Finally, \u0026ldquo;Adios Amigos\u0026rdquo; closes the EP. The song reminds me of their very first album and the track \u0026ldquo;Naked Kids.\u0026rdquo; Both sound very similar. However, \u0026ldquo;Naked Kids\u0026rdquo; is a bonafide salute to dazed days on the beach, whereas \u0026ldquo;Adios Amigos\u0026rdquo; appears to be about a more austere topic, perhaps regarding misconceptions about material possessions (there\u0026rsquo;s an odd reference to Tarascon, a commune in France, that supports this hypothesis). The song plays out, repeating \u0026ldquo;All in a moment, we can live forever.\u0026rdquo; As a longtime fan of the band, this last lyric resonated with my past worry that the group was heading for a breakup. In the wake of Zucconi and Hooper welcoming their daughter Willa and Rabin getting married, it seemed to me that there was a very real possibility that Grouplove\u0026rsquo;s days, and albums, were numbered. I hope that the band proves me to be an overly pessimistic person and continues to produce more music. Overall, \u003ci\u003eLittle Mess\u003c/i\u003e is an excellent continuation of \u003ci\u003eBig Mess\u003c/i\u003e, and it includes songs that will excite returning fans and create new ones for the accomplished group.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Make Coachella Great Again",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten by Gabrielle Seok \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCoachella Valley Music and Arts Festival started in 1999, as a one-day festival in Indio, California. 18 years later, it is now one of the largest and most recognized festivals in the United States — and the world. How has it become what it is today?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe early seeds of Coachella were planted in 1993, when Pearl Jam refused to perform in Los Angeles as an act of defiance against Ticketmaster’s practices. Instead, the band held a concert in Indio. This location served as inspiration for Paul Tollett, who was the head of Goldenvoice at the time. He envisioned a legacy. Sparked by his fascination for European music festivals like the Glastonbury festival, Tollett wanted to bring something similar to the States. Goldenvoice, spearheaded by Tollett, took a risk and started the music festival, in spite of the negative publicity behind Woodstock ‘99, which was notorious for its problems with looting, arson and rape.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSomehow, the festival endured a few rough initial years, losing money and even skipping a season due to a lack of interest. The birth of Coachella began with raw faith and a reliance on artistry — not radio popularity. The lineups consisted of small artists. It would take years for the festival to build its impressive roster. And because of this, it earned the reputation as the “anti-Woodstock.” It billed itself as a single entity, fueled by a pure love for music and a vision of greatness. You can see why this greatly contrasts with the landscape of the festival today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom an economic perspective, today’s Coachella is an economically ingenious event that tells an inspiring rags-to-riches story about following your dreams. For music lovers, it tells something very different. Coachella is accused of selling out and becoming a mainstream, money-making machine. And this is not unwarranted. What was once rooted in support for independent artists and a sanctuary for local artisans now has become a commercialized annual occasion with corporate sponsorships and headlining pop artists. Not only that, the culture of Coachella has changed to become somewhat of a runway show for attendees who plan their festival outfits months in advance and take hundreds of photos at the three-day long event. Attendees have been criticized for being more concerned about keeping up appearances rather than enjoying the music. Additionally, the exclusive events and after parties that take place during the festival have become a way for social media ‘influencers’ and social climbers to flaunt their arms in their colorful, sought-after wristbands. Considering this, it is not inaccurate to say that the culture of Coachella has dramatically shifted away from what it once stood for. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile it is easy to write off Coachella as a soulless capitalist endeavor, it is important to acknowledge its contribution to the music industry. The monetary value of music maintains legitimacy, as hundreds of thousands of festival-goers pay to see live performances by some of the most popular artists today. Not to mention, the festival does still showcase a variety of talented artists and musicians from across many genres of music, some more well known than others. In its relatively young history, the festival has hosted a plethora of music legends, such as Paul McCartney, Queens of The Stone Age, Dr. Dre, Outkast, Prince, Muse, Jack White and many more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite these, the bitter aftertaste the festival has left in many diehard music fans’ mouths is not to be ignored, especially with the destruction of their initial values and their shifted focus towards money. In the end, it is inconceivable to see Coachella ever reverting back to its roots; however, it should serve as a cautionary tale for other festivals in the market today. Music and arts festivals must consider the sacrifices that will be made when they commercialize on such a large scale. While it may be extremely tempting due to its ridiculous profitability, the ethics behind the art of music appreciation will be compromised. The music lovers, also known as the tastemakers, the independent bloggers, and more importantly, the ones who are willing to pay for music on a smaller scale, will slowly fade away as festivals encroach on the mainstream music scene. They will search anew, leaving behind commercialized successes as one for the uncultured masses, while merely holding onto nostalgic remnants of what once satisfied their adoration of live music.\u003c/p\u003e",

But this unconventional weekday night is considered anything but for Swedish EDM duo Galantis. For them, mixing hyped electronic beats and hit Grammy-nominated tracks, synergistic and energized live-performances, and making every member of the crowd dance the night away has undoubtedly become a lifestyle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe duo made their debut in early 2013 and their rapidly growing notoriety and popularity can be attributed to their catchy dance music, dynamic and creative remixes of popular songs, and meaningful original lyrics. And on April 18, Galantis’ vivacious, larger-than-life live performance rocked the Novo, a small intimate nightclub safely tucked away behind the bustling Staples Center in Downtown L.A. With energy unrivaled by many seasoned performers, it comes as no surprise that they’ve been invited to perform and headline at music festivals such Coachella, Electric Daisy Carnival, and Lollapalooza. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo kick off the night, Galantis’ performance was opened by SNBRN. Also signed with Atlantic Records, SNBRN blends a mix of different genres including house, indie dance, and disco. The crowd was lukewarm but became more energized as soon as he played two of his most popular songs, “Raindrops” and his latest single “You Got Me.” At first, I was skeptical of the SNBRN-Galantis pairing, but I found over time that SNBRN was the most fitting opener for the night, as the mellow undulating beats of SNBRN complemented the high-pitched, high-energy staccatos of Galantis. The visuals on the screen also created a feeling of catharsis that accurately fit the beats of the songs played. While SNBRN played for the first hour, people trickled in and out of the venue, and the ground floor was fairly vacant. Given this was a sold out show and the Novo is a very small venue, I was intrigued as to what the environment would be like when it was completely packed. EDM artists are usually popular in the music festival setting because it allows guests and attendees to move from artist to artist and also dance freely to the beat drops without injuring the people around them. I soon found out that space to dance and move to the music was a luxury I would no longer enjoy as it became closer and closer to the time Galantis would perform. The upsurge of people waiting to see Galantis made it so that people were standing shoulder to shoulder and physical contact between strangers was an inevitable part of the experience. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen my phone notified me that it was 10 p.m., like clockwork, the lights dimmed completely and the venue grew silent. Almost immediately, the crowd crescendoed in cheers shouting, “Galantis!” like whirlwinds around me. The size of the venue made it so that even the smallest of sounds were amplified and created an environment similar to an echo chamber. The tension of anticipation continued to build and the energy of the crowd was overwhelming. The sounds of the crowd was immediately punctuated by Galantis’ first song, “Runaway,” as Christian Karlsson and Linus Eklöw both jumped out on stage, waving two large GALANTIS flags. Throughout their entire performance, both Karlsson and Eklow continued to amp up the energy of the crowd by counting down the beat drops, staggering between mellower songs and high-energy lineups, and dancing and jumping along with the crowd. Their exuberance and interaction with the crowd truly made the night an unforgettable one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\nThe beautiful visual graphics and the fitting strobe lights also made the night remarkable. The neon strobe lights fit the beats of the music and combined with the white lighting and the mythical animals that graced the digital screen of the stage made it feel like an out-of-body experience. The smoke machine and confetti were wonderful touches that completed the experience and rained down like colorful snowflakes over the raging crowd. The enticing, exuberant nature of the duo made the crowd let go of all of the stresses associated with a typical weekday night.\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By: Brittany Hewitt\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date: 4/28/17\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was a Tuesday night when my dad and I walked into the Echoplex around 9 p.m. A white dude, barefoot and shirtless, was singing intensely on stage. His whole body was involved with it and every ounce of him was pulsating, from his toes (since he wasn’t wearing shoes) to his raised shoulders. To both of our pleasant surprise, it was actually quite good; the audience itself was into it too, probably thinking he’s the kind of guy they wouldn’t mind smoking a joint with. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs I ordered an IPA, in true Echo Park fashion, I reflected on how \u003ca href=\"https://andyboay.bandcamp.com/music\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAndy Boay\u003c/a\u003e is not particularly the same mellow vibe as HOMESHAKE, but he certainly is the same alt energy. This curatorial choice by the Echoplex probed me with questions. Do you feature similar music in the opener before the main act, so you’re lubed up, or do you go for its stimulating antithesis sound so you’re pleasantly surprised? The Echoplex chose the later, which left us all impressionistically intrigued and pleasantly surprised.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally the part we’d been waiting for arrived: \u003ca href=\"https://homeshake.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHOMESHAKE\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D9kHdsIAR5Ls\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9kHdsIAR5Ls?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eHOMESHAKE is the love project of Peter Sagar, occasionally joined by Mark Goetz, Greg Napier, and Brad Loughead. Growing up in the graylands of Alberta, Canada, Sagar later moved to Montreal, weaving in suburban soundscapes with upbeat tempos. Their debut album,\u003ci\u003e In the Shower\u003c/i\u003e, masterfully captures what this must have been like, the perfect album for steamy showers and relaxing with the bros. HOMESHAKE released another record, \u003ci\u003eMidnight Snack\u003c/i\u003e, the next year, marking his transition from working as Mac Demarco’s bassist to developing an individualistic, slow rally for wandering the streets stoned with your homies. His latest album, \u003ci\u003eFresh Air,\u003c/i\u003e is sleepy, lovey-dovey, and perfect for a daytime booty call.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Echoplex was crowded with people who look like they used to be Mac Demarco fans but aren\u0026rsquo;t now because he’s cool - retired Demarcos, if you will. This is all too ironic as Demarco himself was on the smoke deck outside the entire set, but I’m sure he was internally bobbing his head. Two disco balls hung over the audience, transfixing the audience into a slow lull, humming and bobbing along to Sagar and his side kicks. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTheir live performance sounded identical to their albums. It’s incredible how you can close your eyes and meditate on this sound, and it’s just like being in your homie Josh’s backyard a few streets down in Echo Park, listening to HOMESHAKE. Still, of course, the real thing is always unbeatable. \u003c/p\u003e",

The first was five years ago, after the release of their second album, and before the five year hiatus the band took until the release of their newest album, “And Then Like Lions.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe El Rey is an intimate venue — the audience is practically on stage with the band. Blind Pilot takes the stage quietly, and without a word, begins the opening bars of “The Story I Heard,” a popular song from their album “Three Rounds and a Sound.” The audience grins collectively in recognition, leaning eagerly towards the stage, eyes cast towards the bewitching Israel Nebeker, the band’s lead singer and frontman. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBlind Pilot is inexplicably perfect in concert — better live than recorded, no doubt. It’s hard to believe that the velvet of Israel’s voice is untouched by audio editing, but it must be true, because his voice sounds the same, if not better, in person. He hits every note effortlessly, and the sound of the band behind him stays precisely in rhythm, a cohesive unit emitting a symphonically complex sound. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIsrael’s band mates get the chance to show off their similarly celestial voices when the band strips away and three of them - Israel, the bassist Luke Ydstie, and guitarist Kati Claborn triple up to sing the song “Three Rounds and a Sound.” A couple bars into the song, Luke kicks the amp by accident, and their sound goes out. With a brief look of recognition between the three, they step forward together in unison and continue acoustically. The audience chimes in, and soon we are all singing the familiar melancholy tune, hands clasped together. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the show continues smoothly — the band is plugged back in, and continues to play popular songs from their old albums, along with songs from “And Then Like Lions,” which has a different feel from the band’s other albums, which work together almost as one. “We Are the Tide” and “Three Rounds and a Sound” feel like a young man’s ode to adventure and youthful romance. “And then Like Lions” is older, seasoned, weary, but hopeful. The album feels like its full of healing, which makes sense, considering the tragedy that lead Israel to write it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe audience is rapt the entire time, swaying and dancing occasionally to more energetic songs like “One Red Thread.” The band finishes to thunderous applause, and of course returns for an extended encore of three more songs. First just Israel comes out, and plays us something new. My friends and I joke that he’s the only artist who could pull off playing something new as an encore, and he can. The rest of the band returns and performs two old songs — “New York,” and a personal favorite, “The Colored Night,” to which the audience sings — almost yells — along.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBlind Pilot’s growth is palpable, but the band hasn’t strayed from the core elements that make their music work so well: Ryan Dobrowski’s train-like drum tempo, phonetically pleasing harmonies, and a full, folky sound. For people like me who grew up with the band, age 16 to 21, this somehow steadfast change is poignant. \u003c/p\u003e",

The band also features members from Acrylics and Violent Change.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile the influences of all three bands are apparent in this release (Acrylics especially), I think the only way to truly do Crisis Man justice is to set all personal feelings for the three bands aside while listening and instead hold Crisis man to its own light. That being said, this is a solid release.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the title track “Crisis Man,” it is immediately apparent what kind of sound the band is going for. This release is raw, straight-forward punk rock at its best. Fans of Ceremony will have no problem recognizing Ross’s unique vocal style, which matches the band’s Bay Area punk style perfectly. The tracks in this album flow into each other seamlessly, which is a double edged sword in itself as no song stands out in particular, but the overall feel of the album is consistent. I feel the production in this album is also noteworthy. I was afraid this release would be overproduced but the band decided to go with a stripped-back, garage-esque recording style that compliments their brand of punk perfectly. The guitars are messy (and I say that in the best way possible), the bass is punchy, the drums are loud, and the vocals are angry. This is everything one would want from a Bay Area punk release in 2017.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe only real drawback of this album is that while it is good, it does not necessarily do anything new. While I feel that the band knew exactly what sound they wanted to go for and did so with precision, they failed to really bend the form of the genre and make it into something that is their own. So, while I do think this a very solid release it is not one that I think is particularly significant to the genre moving forward as a whole. Regardless, I would highly recommend checking it out and I very much so look forward to seeing what this band has to offer in the future\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e8/10\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Look for him to singlehandedly will the Cavs past the Warriors in a hard fought series. The Cavs have nothing to lose, even as the defending champs; the Warriors are the ones who blew the 3-1 lead last season, and then went out and poached Kevin Durant during the offseason. It is up to the Warriors to prove last year was a fluke, with the added pressure only playing into the Cavs’ success. With Kevin Love finally fitting in as the third piece of the big three alongside James and Kyrie Irving this postseason (17.2 PPG, 10.4 RPG) and with Tristan Thompson continuing to be dominant on the boards, Cleveland will win its second NBA Championship in a row, and Lebron James will inch that much closer to being the greatest of all-time. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eX-Factor:\u003c/b\u003e Cleveland’s Big Small Ball Lineup, going with Irving at the point, Kyle Korver at the two, Lebron and Channing Frye at the forward positions, and Kevin Love at the five. The best way to fight fire is with fire, and the Cavs could turn to this lineup to match the Warriors three point tenacity, with the 6’7” Korver and 6’11” Frye bringing their .415 and .526 three point shooting percentage this postseason to spread the floor alongside the Big Three. With Korver and Frye playing alongside the 6’10” Love, and the 6’8” James, the Cavs will be getting big as well with this lineup. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMVP: \u003c/b\u003eThe easy answer here is James, who I think will win the award.

The same will happen this time as the Kevin Durant-led Warriors crush Cleveland in the not so epic final installment of the trilogy, giving millions of bandwagon Warriors fans a sickening and horrifying sense of cheerfulness that they don’t deserve.

I’m going with the heart on this one. And here’s why. Most experts are picking the Warriors to defeat the Cavs with ease.  Vegas has the Warriors at -240 to win it all.  The last time a team with odds this high was the 2009 LA Lakers who beat the Orlando Magic that season. Everyone’s assuming that the lethal firepower of Steph Curry, KD, and company will be too much for the Cavs. But these same Cavs rose from the ashes of a 3-1 deficit like a Phoenix last year to capture the chip. These same Cavs have nothing to lose.  These same Cavs have the best player in the universe, Lebron James, suiting up for them. Basketball is literally the only sport where one player can will his team to victory. I believe Lebron and the Cavs will leave it all out on the floor and shock the world…again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eX Factor: \u003c/b\u003eKevin Love has to show up big here.

That’s pretty much how I came across the band Miami Horror, their song ‘Leila’ catching my eye immediately and drawing me in with its colorful cover art and bittersweet track name. This four-piece from Melbourne, Sydney, just recently released their EP titled \u003ci\u003eThe Shapes\u003c/i\u003e with hopes of gathering the attention of 80’s music fanatics and 21st-century indie music listeners alike. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter being on an extended hiatus, the band is back and better than ever with this groovy 5-song EP. When asked about their inspiration for the album by \u003ca href=\"https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/03/miami-horror-new-ep-the-shapes-new-song-leila.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePaste Magazine’s Scott Russell\u003c/a\u003e, the four-set of Miami Horror had this to say:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe idea for The Shapes was to have an amalgam of music and art. We picked a bunch of artists that inspire us and got them to create street art pieces to be displayed in some of our favourite cities in the world. The inspiration for the music was 70’s post-punk and 80’s afro-funk with songs about the absurdity of existence and what it means to be alive at this point in time on planet earth and all that entails.”\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 80’s vibe is incredibly real from start to finish of this EP, but the band somehow found a way to couple it with their own unique ambient sound to create a 5-song EP that’ll have you repeatedly smashing the replay button. There’s no doubt that every track will have listeners movin’, groovin’, and vibin’ out with the intensely happy instruments but raw, passionately written lyrics. “Sign of the Times,” the first song on the EP, is nothing but high energetic fun that’ll leave listeners wanting to hop in a convertible and drive 70 MPH all the way down to the beach.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJVfT7gkfdq8\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVfT7gkfdq8?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterestingly enough, the fourth song titled “Azimba” has an added flavour to it that I certainly wouldn’t have expected. “Azimba” is like the hybrid of popular wave 80’s music and afro-funk, delivering both in style, funk, and cheerfulness. The band even went as far as to have an African chorus hop on the track! When describing the song, the band had this to say: \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis is an extremely upbeat style jam, afro-funk at it’s most simple and fun. It came very naturally and quickly, we tried to make sure we didn’t complicate it and kept the structure simple and didn’t crowd the motifs. We wrote vocal melodies ourselves and then sent them to a choir in Africa to record them and come up with lyrics. It translates to ‘laughter, joy \u0026amp; dancing is now,’ which is perfect for the feeling of the song.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a bit of a simpin’ mood but still want to have some fun? The band’s song “Leila” will do just the trick! Taking a bit of the front seat of the EP, “Leila” is a wonderful upbeat, 80’s sounding song paired with a couple of heavy-hitting lyrics about a woman whom you love and lust over who simultaneously drives you mad (because we’ve all felt that at some point, right?) “I just can\u0026rsquo;t believe it/You left me here alone/When you coming back now?/Looking in the mirror/For all I used to know/I just can\u0026rsquo;t believe it/Leila, why did you leave again?Stay home/Leila, can you believe again?/Stay home” - lyrics that’ll have you in your feelings, but a beat that’ll have you moving your feet! The band commented on the song, “It’s about a woman who makes you mad with lust and love and all the other emotions. It is something most men can relate to I think, there is always one woman that floats around your mind and drives you into madness.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, this album exceeding any expectations I had and I’m very certain it’ll do the same to its listeners, whether they be pre-existing Miami Horror fans or not. \u003ci\u003eThe Shapes\u003c/i\u003e has a little something that everyone can enjoy, and you don’t always find that!\u003c/p\u003e",

The entire atmosphere of the Ace Hotel Theater was transformed into what seemed to be straight from the imagination of artist Oliver Hibert. When first walking into the event, I noticed huge psychedelic wall posters for sale and long lines of many hip 30-somethings ordering drinks from man-bunned bartenders. Women walked by wearing huge platforms shoes and neon plastic dresses surrounded by men in full-blown 60s attire. The crowd was probably the most cohesively fashioned group I’ve ever seen at a large event in Los Angeles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"564\" data-orig-width=\"845\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1b9ae7db44798fa2af3474645d1dfadc/tumblr_inline_oq6iq9OV7u1qhakxc_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"564\" data-orig-width=\"845\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince I had been running late (parking Downtown is sometimes impossible) I rushed to the front of the stage and immediately found myself surrounded by photographers from the LA Times, LA Weekly, and huge music magazines. Before I could really take in the environment, canons filled with confetti erupted all over the stage and covered the audience! Massive saturated balloons were released from the ceiling and people next to me started throwing them at everyone in the audience. I knew right away that this night would be wild. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"618\" data-orig-width=\"926\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d90b858a0c7c9ba16ef76b2af7d74f9c/tumblr_inline_oq6iqsmiP51qhakxc_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"618\" data-orig-width=\"926\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt seemed that the production scale of this show had no limits. While the Flaming Lips played all of their most famous songs (Do You Realize??, Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots Pt. 1, and The Yeah, Yeah, Yeah Song), and also songs from their newly released album Oczy Mlody, giant blow-up dolls and rainbows filled the stage. During several songs blow-up eyeballs and lips surrounded Wayne and at one point the band was accompanied on stage by costumed figures that resembled Yo Gabba Gabba television characters. At one point Wayne came into the stage riding an extremely phallic unicorn with laser lights jutting around him like a halo. Very trippy. This was probably the most amazing live show I’ve ever been to, especially since everyone in the crowd was so overjoyed to see them play. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"650\" data-orig-width=\"975\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aa690568c8eebbd4143f38238aa2e4ae/tumblr_inline_oq6ishUPsA1qhakxc_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"650\" data-orig-width=\"975\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"650\" data-orig-width=\"975\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/104449e7f1d4337b1e64c6ec3f7a0ee0/tumblr_inline_oq6ir4ePqi1qhakxc_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"650\" data-orig-width=\"975\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eI decided to bring two of my friends up to the VIP balcony area since we had Press Passes and check out the social scene upstairs. As we walked by a bigger group of people by the balcony, I thought they looked like they would be friends with Miley Cyrus since they all had such a trippy and outrageous style. As soon as I thought that, I saw Miley Cyrus was actually sitting in the middle of their group with her fiance Liam Hemsworth. This makes sense since Cyrus has toured with the Flaming Lips multiple times and they all collaborate with Oliver Hibert who designs the Flaming Lips’ merch at shows. They seemed like a really cool group of friends so after a little while I decided to talk to them and ended up being their photographer for the night. I took pictures of the girls in the group, one looked a lot like Yolandi from Die Antwoord and had the coolest green hair. Finally, they invited my group of friends to join them backstage with the bands. As soon as we got backstage, they ran off to go talk to some people and left us there to just hang out. I took some pictures of Wayne with my friend Libby and talked to some of the band members in between songs, they were all such beautiful people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"546\" data-orig-width=\"819\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0428b7ba776f989f09c265448f47cfd3/tumblr_inline_oq6irghNBX1qhakxc_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"546\" data-orig-width=\"819\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"650\" data-orig-width=\"975\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f737a18828d637b05d4228fd3254c2bc/tumblr_inline_oq6is9kgdX1qhakxc_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"650\" data-orig-width=\"975\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere was an open after party after the show on the roof of the Ace Hotel where a lot of the band hung out later in the night.

Since his take-off with the single “Fetti,” Playboi Carti has linked up with the A$VP mob, dabbled in tracks with members on AWFUL Records, signed to Interscope Records, and dropped collaborations with Lil Uzi Vert and other New Age rappers. However, the overdue mixtape falls short of feeling like a proper introduction to the rapper. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom the introductory track, “Location,” one can already taste the lack of cares that Carti brings to his own project. The track is carried by atmospheric pads and a thick, throbbing kick drum. Aside from the fun 808 bass hits that surround Carti’s ad-libs, the track does nothing, but be a simple, straightforward trap welcoming. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat follows is one of the better songs on the entire tape, “Magnolia.” Despite the fact that the beat feels more bland and more basic in structure than the production found on “Location,” Carti manages to be an entertaining force on this piece. However, the incessant repetitions of “young Carti, young Carti” and blatantly borrowed flows might be too obvious for the song to be anything special. Seriously, just play any Lil Uzi Vert track, the same triplet flow is being recycled all the time. Yet, the hook manages to be an attractive point throughout the track. The previous remark on the flows is further supported by the following track: “Lookin” featuring Lil Uzi Vert. The barrage of ad-libs and the otherwise boring verse provided by Vert make this yet another disposable track. The fact that the last 40 seconds of the track are drenched in ad-libs does not help the track’s case. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Wokeuplikethis*” feels like a decent track that tries to make up for the alright bars. It is a stable and steady production, with yet another “just OK” feature by Lil Uzi Vert and an “interesting” spelling of the track’s title. The hook, sung by Carti, “Woke up to niggas sounding like me,” is provided with a delivery that could be found on a reggaeton radio smash and it — objectively — provides a small angle of difference. The tracks “Let it Go” and “Half \u0026amp; Half” are supported with interesting, slower beats that are rich with subby 808 hits and pitch-shifting hi hats. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, the main criticism of the entire tape rears its ugly head once again: Playboi Carti depends too greatly on his ad-libs and not enough on interesting, witty, funny, braggadocious or just outright entertaining lyrical content. The majority of “Half \u0026amp; Half” is composed of ad-libs, giving a proper meaning to the title of the song (get it? Half ad-libs, Half beat production). “New Choppa,” unfortunately, depends greatly on ASAP Rocky’s performance before the track has even reached the 1 minute mark. Thank the Trap gods that Rocky isn’t afraid of a beat that sounds like a terrible chopped and screwed version of the \u003ci\u003eLavender Town\u003c/i\u003e soundtrack (Google it). The beat’s synths are somewhat annoying as Rocky easily and gracefully flows from bar to bar. If it weren’t for the blessing provided by the feature, this track would also end up in the recycling bin without question. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe hook to “Other S**t” is especially annoying, there is no melody or rhythm other than the same triplet delivery in sight. At the same time Carti is clearly tending to the lowest common denominator by making notes to the insincere “other s**t” that he does: have money, have girls, have a squad with money, et cetera. By the time this reviewer hit the middle of the track “No.9,” the single word, shouty bars, and fall-to-the-background beat had driven me nauseous. The fact that the song abruptly ends provides one more reason to believe that Carti simply doesn’t care. With the support of the ASAP Mob, Carti does not need to do much more than just be present on his own material to garner attention. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Dothatshit!” was interesting as a track because the title doesn’t censor the swear word like the title “Other S**t.” What gives? Aside from that, however, the track is a step in the more melodic, sleepy direction in which Lil Uzi Vert is experienced. Despite the fact that he is heavily influenced by his contemporaries, the rapper manages to string together an entertaining hook towards the last 40 seconds of the track. “Lame N****z” is yet another title that is censored for some reason. Other than that, the track is not really interesting at all. The thin, scrappy voice that Carti provides on the track does not contrast well with what appears to be a sample of a lion roaring in the background. In fact, the lion roar can lead one to believe that this mixtape was instead meant to be a pretty, glistening beat tape. “Lame N****z,” like “Yah Mean,” suffers from a lack of cohesion and organization. These are characteristics that create memorable trap bangers, and are learned through experience and effort. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne could argue that the track “Kelly K” was already played somewhere in the earlier portion of the mixtape. Thankfully, the track “Had 2” contains such a thick, rubbery 808 bass that it drowns out any annoying ad-libs that threaten to ruin the upbeat instrumentals behind Carti. It is unfortunate that Carti clearly has other priorities than making entertaining bangers that could give him the longevity he needs to survive in the trap-sphere.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eOverall Rating: 4/10\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eBest: \u003c/b\u003e“Wokeuplikethis*”, “New Choppa”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWorst: \u003c/b\u003e“Half \u0026amp; Half”, “Lame N****z”\u003c/p\u003e",

How would you explain math rock to me?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’d say that math rock is less about being classified under certain criteria and more about not being constrained by common conventions and having the freedom to venture beyond into what’s exciting and - for lack of a better word - odd. The short answer that most people will give is that it’s rock that is highly technical and in irregular meters but there’s no singular rule that defines it. I’m certainly very liberal at times with how I use the term on my show. The day after the inauguration I put together a playlist that included bands like Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, and Refused. No one would consider any of those bands to be math rock but when you listen to them under that context, they fit in perfectly. The fun thing about having this platform is I get to challenge what people think math rock is. I choose to view it as less of a set of technical and stylistic characteristics and more of an approach and intention behind the music. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHonestly it’s not a fantastic term but it’s just two syllables and can be used as a blanket term for a large expanse of music that can sometimes fall between the cracks. I guess one of the nice things about having a show about it is I get to just play the music and let other people come to their own conclusions as to what it means. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat or who influences your music preferences? Would you say that your taste in music has evolved as you’ve grown and changed, or are you loyal to the soil to certain artists and genres?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009It’s always evolving, or at least it’s expanding. I’ve certainly gone through phases of mass musical consumption where I would download any and every album that came my way but these days I have less free time and free space on my computer so for the most part I just go off the recommendations of others or let it find me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wouldn’t say I’m loyal to any genres as much as I’m just loyal to music with humanity. It doesn’t really matter what the style or instrumentation is, I just like hearing a person behind the music, which is just as common in instrumental music as it is in vocal. Although I haven’t listened to much industrial EDM so who knows, maybe I like music that doesn’t sound like humans too. I’m sure I’ll get around to trying it one of these days.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1365\" data-orig-width=\"2048\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b26fa13038997ba49fd52798de8a6fd9/tumblr_inline_op6yeb9xxg1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1365\" data-orig-width=\"2048\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2\u003eYou’ve featured live music sets from groups such as Mammoth and Hollow Ran. During these close moments with the bands, how do you react? Do you play it cool and professional? Are you a screaming fan?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009In both cases, I’ve actually known the guys personally before they came on the show. I met both Wes [from Mammoth] and Taylor [from Hollow Ran] on the same night at a show back in the summer of 2015. On the second ever episode of 2 Stones + 1 Bird, I had a band called Sea Monkey See come on and do an in-station performance. We posted some videos which got around so when I met those guys a few weeks later they’d already seen the videos and were familiar with the show, which was pretty cool considering how new everything was. I don’t remember who approached whom about them coming on the show but it definitely came up during that first meeting and there was a lot of mutual excitement to make it happen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI don’t know that I’ve ever been a screaming fan in any context. The whole vibe of our in-station performances is pretty chill. That said, if you ever see me in the background of any photos or videos while the band is playing I will most certainly have the biggest grin on my face and/or will be awkwardly math-head-banging. They’re both truly phenomenal bands. There’s no way to articulate how talented those guys are without falling into cliches so I’ll just leave it at that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSome DJs use their radio persona as an alter ego, while others are exactly the same person on and off air. What tone or image are you trying to portray during 2 Stones + 1 Bird as DJ Merna Rex?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009I don’t think there’s any major difference between Layla and Merna except for outside of the show I also listen to a fair amount of non-mathy music, whereas she’s always very involved and centered in that scene. So in that way it’s really nice that no matter what I’m doing outside of the show, I always maintain that connection to this music that has meant so much to me for so long.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe tone is just me sharing music that excites me. I’m still adding new things to make it even more personal like adding pedal demos and discussions. There were a couple of times when I thought, “What if this is too nerdy? Would anyone besides me understand or be interested in this?” but I think that’s kind of the point. People can tell when you’re feigning interest and when you’re genuinely passionate about what you’re doing. I think that kind of excitement can be contagious and it helps other people to be more open to listening as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat is one thing that people should know about you, your show, or both?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009I co-host every show with my dog, DJ $aphrodite. She’s still a bit shy on the mic so I do all the talking but she puts together some pretty tight playlists and does a mean crossfade.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1417\" data-orig-width=\"2048\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/411f91189ea919f88e6cd53d51948e03/tumblr_inline_op6ygoFe661qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1417\" data-orig-width=\"2048\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

Entertainment is coming to a theater near you tonight!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI had the pleasure of attending an early screening and press junket for \u003ci\u003eFist Fight\u003c/i\u003e at the W in Westwood earlier this month. I was excited to see members of the star-studded cast before the junket even began. Walking through the lobby I spotted \u003ci\u003eTeen Wolf \u003c/i\u003estars Max and Charlie Carver, and checking into hospitality I scooted past the face of the beloved character Schmidt from \u003ci\u003eNew Girl\u003c/i\u003e, Max Greenfield, who pitched the story behind \u003ci\u003eFist Fight\u003c/i\u003e.\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first portion of the junket featured Greenfield, writers Van Robichaux and Evan Susser, producers Dan Cohen and John Rickard, and Director Richie Keen. Fist Fight is the first feature film from Keen, who has worked with Charlie Day in the past on \u003ci\u003eIt’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\u003c/i\u003e. Day and Keen came to the film separately; Day had signed on to co-star opposite Ice Cube in the role of Andy Campbell before Keen caught hold of the script. Describing his initial interest in the film, Keen said:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I grew up in John Hughes country. Suburban Chicago. I grew up where they were filming \u003ci\u003eFerris Bueller\u003c/i\u003e. I would sneak onto the set and watch them film \u003ci\u003eFerris Bueller\u003c/i\u003e. John Hughes was my idol, and when I read the movie I felt like this was a rated-R John Hughes movie. It had…all the tropes of a John Hughes movie: it all takes place in a day, it takes place in high school, it’s the day that changed someone’s life, but it had a piece of \u003ci\u003eAnimal House\u003c/i\u003e in it. It was a crazier look at high school. So yes, it played to my sick sensibility, and Charlie and I began a year and a half long process of being partners on it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2364\" data-orig-height=\"1722\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f0971d3fd13d8ed22d074b249a9be35a/tumblr_inline_olk0cvBkmQ1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2364\" data-orig-height=\"1722\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second portion of the junket featured Keen and actors Day, Ice Cube, Tracy Morgan, Jillian Bell, Christina Hendricks, JoAnna Garcia Swisher, the Carver twins, and Kym Whitley.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn landing Ice Cube opposite Day, Keen said, “I can’t think of a more comedic visual to go with the phenomenal script I read.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKeen won every single pick for the all-star cast of \u003ci\u003eFist Fight\u003c/i\u003e, rewriting the role of the nympho-tweaker guidance counselor for Bell and even getting down on his knees at a studio meeting to beg her to join the film. Bell commented on the royal treatment, saying, “It was the nicest and the most unnecessary thing anyone has ever done for me. I was like, I love this script, I love you, I love who’s in the movie, and I was so happy that he wanted me to be in it, and the knees, getting on the knees was a big bonus!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1820\" data-orig-height=\"1217\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f166ccdfa27a4799f52ea900bc3924a2/tumblr_inline_olk0dnvyFk1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1820\" data-orig-height=\"1217\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe film also features Morgan as gym teacher Coach Crawford in his first appearance since his accident - Keen commented: \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I skyped with Tracy, and within 30 seconds Tracy’s asking me, ‘Whose Captain Kirk’s best friend?’… ‘Spock?’-‘No it ain’t Spock, Spock calls him Captain. You don’t call your best friend captain. Bones says ‘Dammit Jim,’ so Bones is his best friend!’…I’m like, he’s fine, he’s ready to work!” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe also stated that working with Morgan was, “Above and beyond what I could have hoped for. Tracy is just such a kind, gentle, thoughtful person and also crazy. He was so on his game, I felt like he elevated the material for all of us.

I was on the couch for a year after that Walmart truck hit me… I just let it all out, and this seemed the movie to do it at!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Richie thank you, I love you for believing in me… I was so scared the first day, I didn’t know if I was funny or not, after what I had just been through, and then I had the team around me\u0026hellip;Cube was like a brother to me. They really encouraged me and relaxed me, and I just had fun after that. Fun.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I never left. I’m proud to be of service to you when I make you laugh. Nah, I just picked up where I left off at. Walmart can’t stop me!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eFist Fight\u003c/i\u003e was filmed on location in Atlanta, and used local extras for the explosive, enormous final scene. The final fight took more than a week to shoot. On training for the battle Day said: \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I did just have like a week of training, because they had to show me how to make a fist without breaking my thumb! I tried to not make it look like I knew what I was doing, which I don’t…I trained with a guy named Edwards, who’s a big UFC guy. At one point we’re doing the moves and he’s like, ‘now you duck,’ and going two miles an hour, well I looked the wrong way, accidentally hits my head and almost completely knocked me out. So I have a lot more respect for those UFC guys, and how tough they are, and I would never, ever want to do it, and I don’t recommend it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"816\" data-orig-height=\"1170\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d1d00807cedf48bd91fd9808cb16188b/tumblr_inline_olk0fuDiQK1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"816\" data-orig-height=\"1170\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eDay is strung between principal Dean Norris and antagonist Ice Cube throughout the film, fighting to hold on to his dignity and his job with budget cuts cleaning out the teaching staff. On the underlying meaning of the film Ice Cube commented: \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It’s a movie about two teachers fighting. We wanted to make sure we had a cool underlying message…about the school system and how two teachers deal with it. You know, one teacher is ultra-hard and one teacher is trying to appease and get along and befriend students. It is saying a lot about our school system, what we need to tackle, the problems that we face nowadays…but the overlying message is have fun, laugh, trip off these crazy characters in this scenario. This is a popcorn movie if you ask me. If you’re trying to find a really deep rooted message in it….ahhhhh, excuse me I’ll have to work with you on that.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2496\" data-orig-height=\"1174\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7a4ccbae82e6b9b23af2fabdd6991422/tumblr_inline_olk0gy68ii1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2496\" data-orig-height=\"1174\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eI walked into the theater excited to see some of my heroes appear on screen together. The prison-riot like premise of senior prank day, with the onslaught of increasingly bizarre and violent pranks, kept me laughing the whole film. The chemistry between Day and Ice Cube was phenomenal, and the visual juxtaposition of the two actors was comedic in itself. Keep your eye out for Keen in his cameo performance as the sales clerk in the computer store - his star-spangled first feature film will have you in stitches.\u003c/p\u003e",

Bryan and I headed in early and camped out at the barrier with a clear view of the stage, which was packed with an elaborate setup: at least four bass/guitar combos and a full drum kit for El Ten Eleven — a duo — alone. It was our third time seeing the band perform live, so we had high expectations. The band came on at nine o’clock sharp and delivered a consistently excellent performance, as usual.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first time Bryan and I saw El Ten Eleven, they were nearly late to their show at the Teragram Ballroom due to mudslides across major California highways. The band joked about playing a mudslide remix of their songs in homage to the day’s events. The second time we saw them, Kristian Dunn was disgruntled that we weren’t loud enough in the crowd (we were too busy dancing; who knew?). This time, we were determined to bring the band some joy and danced and cheered loudly to show our support. I guess it worked because we brought an elusive smile to Kristian’s face. They are a joy to watch because of the sheer physicality they exhibit in the layering together of their complex music for a live performance. While Tim Fogarty goes hard on the drum kit, his hair progressively deflating from sweat, Kristian works the loop pedal and deftly swaps among his multiple double-necked guitars. You can’t help but feel impressed when you realize the amount of gear these dudes have to schlep around for a duo act, and a little bit intimidated when you actually see them put all the puzzle pieces together. But it works so well, and that’s what makes them great.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"632\" data-orig-width=\"842\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4b6021c8d3bfc8fbbf3c03d4a3e21384/tumblr_inline_olchr54OST1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"632\" data-orig-width=\"842\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite a brief technical difficulty or two, the band kept the energy high for the entire hour-long set and seemed to be having a good time. I had heard others in the crowd around me talking about how they’d seen El Ten Eleven shows in the past, and that the band brought them back to this show even though they weren’t headlining. It’s extremely difficult to talk about this band since they’ve already rejected so many labels like math rock or art rock, since they create a totally unique experience whenever they take the stage. Their transcendent performance was also perfect against the backdrop of the Fonda, which was full of cool air and misty light. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven though the band has no vocals or lyrics, somehow their evocative song titles, like the much lauded “I Like Van Halen Because My Sister Thinks They Are Cool,” get the message across alongside the complex and beautiful music. Another highlight is in the middle of the song when Tim steps away from the drum kit and joins Kristian to drum on the frets of his guitar for a unique, tinny sound. But the best of all is when the band launches into “the hit,” “Transitions” — a ten-minute instrumental piece so energetic and excellent that you can’t help but dance and feel as if you’re singing along as you move to the funky time signatures and throbbing bass. \u003c/p\u003e",

She dedicates her hour not only to playing music but also to enlightening listeners on the artists, genres, and songs themselves. In the past, DJ FroLite has addressed subjects from female rap artists of the 90′s to controversy over Drake lifting music without due credit to other artists.

Vertigo is the name of my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie. It’s set in the SF Bay Area, where I\u0026rsquo;m from, and is a romantic psycho thriller about a detective with vertigo who falls in love with a woman he\u0026rsquo;s investigating. She mysteriously dies by an apparent \u0026ldquo;suicide,\u0026rdquo; but (spoiler alert) it’s later revealed that a woman set her up to die due to her love for him. I\u0026rsquo;m intrigued by the fanatical obsessions people have towards ideas and feelings and how irrational we are because of these passions. The same type of fear and lust the characters felt in this film is exactly how I feel when I experience live performances and music in general.\u003cbr/\u003e2. Vertigo\u0026rsquo;s symptoms are literally described by WebMD as \u0026ldquo;triggered by the change in the position of your head, feeling pulled to a certain direction.\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;d like to think my show is thought provoking and fun all at once, which is why the political commentary is so important to creating the balance of cool vibes and enlightenment. After all, you\u0026rsquo;re not losing your mind, it’s just vertigo\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhat’s your most notable memory with a guest on air?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of my favorite memories involves me playing a prank on the artist I was interviewing. Eevaan Tre, a R\u0026amp;B artist who played Coachella 2015, came in for a live performance. In the middle of the interview, I had a friend who does amazing voice impersonations, call the on air line to say hi - while pretending I didn\u0026rsquo;t know who she was. She embodied her \u0026ldquo;Martha May\u0026rdquo; sales lady character, where she proceeded to try to sell Eevaan Tre a penis enlargement pump. In infomercial style and a Southern belle accent, she described all the benefits of buying a pump with \u0026ldquo;three easy payments of $59.99 to enlarge any three inch ween!\u0026rdquo; It was the most hilarious conversation I\u0026rsquo;d ever seen. Eevaan Tre was utterly confused and tried to be nice while maintaining good composure. I listen to it whenever I need a good laugh.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhat’s the process behind creating a playlist for the show?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy goal is to ultimately NEVER repeat a song I’ve played on a previous show before. First, I look to see which artists are performing at upcoming festivals by researching the early afternoon or non-headlining artists and listening to their music. Spotify is my godsend because I\u0026rsquo;ll use the artists in the “Emerging Artists” section to find similar sounds and artists who could act as good transition pieces. Monday mornings I usually procrastinate any studying and spend a couple hours listening to the ends of songs so they mesh well to the next. Transitions are key. I also like to create two different vibes for the whole show, so, for example, the first half will be slower melodies with soul vocals, and then by the end will transition to hardcore rap with acoustic beats.  Of course, the artist I’m interviewing will also have their song played as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eYou can pick anybody in the universe to help co-host and curate an episode of the show… who do you pick? What do you talk about with your co-host?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf anyone knows me, they know three things: I love Red Bull, buttered popcorn, and Kanye West. As cliche as the Kanye fandom is and how diehard I profess to be on social media, I truly believe future generations will look back on the millennial generation and study Kanye\u0026rsquo;s work to understand us as a species. I’ve gotten into arguments with complete strangers about his work and even contemplated peeing my pants when I waited through a set to get to the front to see him during FYF - because aside from the arrogant character he plays for the media, I think he has the wit to make humans think again. After reading the book his mom wrote, \u003ci\u003eRaising Kanye,\u003c/i\u003e and watching the two hour long Lou Stoppard interview, my understanding elevated to a new level of respect. He talks about \u0026ldquo;wanting to be five again\u0026rdquo; so he can experience the creative freedom that exists without being vulnerable to social norms. So, on my show, we would discuss the human condition, the commodification of art, and what a #Kanye2020 presidency would actually look like.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eAny words of advice for future radio DJ’s?\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCHOOSE your words carefully. ACTUALLY think before you speak. LISTEN to your shows after they air and make notes of where you think you sounded stupid and what you think really worked. Recognize which words you use too often and have fun with your vocal ranges. Create a list of topics you are unfamiliar with but have always wanted to explore. Don\u0026rsquo;t try to impress your friends - impress yourself - and surprise yourself by creating a new character that exists only in the depths of the imagination you are usually to scared to discover. This can be done when you authentically live in the moment (yeah yeah, cheesy) and if you want to interview people/artists, never think you \u0026lsquo;aren\u0026rsquo;t good enough\u0026rsquo; to pitch to their PR team. Its all a numbers game - if you pitch to 15 different press teams and get three responses, you\u0026rsquo;ll book your calendar in no time.\u003c/p\u003e",

The funky West Coast sound is almost solely\nrepresented by YG in the mainstream music world. More impressively, he’s done\nso without the help of Dr. Dre, the genre’s godfather, who’s worked with\neveryone from Kendrick Lamar to Xzibit.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs part of Red\nBull’s “30 Days in LA” campaign, YG performed at the Wiltern Theatre in\nKoreatown. Red Bull added some flavor to the event by decorating the venue with\nphoto booths and vintage TVs displaying the names of other artists participating\nin “30 Days in LA.” For those wondering about merchandise available, a number\nof 4Hunnid (YG’s clothing brand) hoodies and shirts were on sale for anywhere\nfrom $20 to $100. Foam fingers, with “Fuck Donald Trump” printed on them, were\nalso on sale and seemed to be the most popular item sold. The venue itself\ndiffers from most in that it has five or so general admission sections\nseparated by empty walkways. Unfortunately, my press pass didn’t grant me\nentrance to the middle section in the front. I didn’t like the sections as they\nstifled the crowd’s energy, however they ensured that most people had a good\nview of the stage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJ\nVision, YG’s DJ, came on stage shortly after 10:30 p.m. After Vision played a\nfew bangers to hype up the crowd, YG made a grand entrance. Gunshots followed\nby police sirens echoed throughout the venue as four men dressed in blue scrubs\nrolled YG on stage in a stretcher. The visual screen displayed doctors in an\noperating room and YG performed “Who Shot Me?” while on the stretcher. Despite\nbeing on his back, YG possessed energy and set the tone for the show.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3200\" data-orig-height=\"2133\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f3b96ead9103500fae14639c9f62a892/tumblr_inline_oi9ay37rrb1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3200\" data-orig-height=\"2133\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eYG followed “Who\nShot Me?” with a high energy performance of “BPT.” The Los Angeles native\nplayed an even mix of songs from “My Krazy Life” and “Still Brazy.” Despite\nreleasing a mixtape “Red Friday” on November 25, YG didn’t perform\nany songs featured on the new album. Between songs YG would occasionally say a\nfew words about the crowd or content of his songs, but the show had a good flow.\nHe seemed especially excited to be performing in front of his hometown crowd. His\nmonologues never dragged on and were often funny. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTechnically, YG\nwas solid. Although initially, his mumbled voice was overpowered by the backing\ntrack, after two or three songs he found his groove vocally. He often ended\nsongs acapella so the audience could clearly hear him. The visual screen behind\nYG added a lot to the show as well. It went from displaying palm trees to being\ncompletely red during “Still Brazy.” The visuals made the show aesthetically\ninteresting and added another dimension to YG’s performance. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the more\ntenured YG fans, he performed a few oldies, such as “Toot It and Boot It” and\n“Bitchez,” the latter of which he brought out RJ for. Being in his home city,\nYG made sure to bring out a few other special guests. In addition, he brought\nDJ Mustard and G-Eazy towards the end of the show. During “Still Brazy,” a\nnumber of YG’s friends joined him on stage in an improvised manner that got the\ncrowd hyped up. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eGiven the fact\nthat YG named his tour “The Fuck Donald Trump Tour,” the crowd was extremely\neager to hear “FDT,” and the performance did not disappoint. YG turned the\nfinale into a spectacle unlike most rap shows. Despite seemingly focused on a\nserious subject, YG kept it lighthearted and focused on creating a fun\natmosphere rather than a serious one. YG invited a diverse group of people on\nstage. He made sure to have a woman, as well as Hispanic, black, and white people on stage. Once\non stage, a Donald Trump piñata was lowered onto the stage to an ironic\nrendition of “Hail to the Chief.” YG handed out some sticks and laid down some\nrules before telling the group on stage to take swings on the piñata. After the\nTrump piñata was beaten to a pulp, the visual screen simply displayed “Fuck\nDonald Trump,” and YG exploded into “FDT.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYG’s performance\ndiffered from most in that he truly put made his performance a show. He did\nmore than just show up and perform a few songs, instead he turned the event\ninto something extravagant. The performance which lasted a little over an hour\nflew by. Next time YG has a show in Los Angeles, I’ll be sure to be in\nattendance.\u003c/p\u003e",

I especially appreciate your point about contact, I think it rings true. One aspect that troubles me, or at least nags, is the question of being heard. Many people find comfort in keeping a diary, or holding a personal relationship with God. I, on the other hand, have never been able to commit to a diary (or conversations with God)—I write down the thoughts I consider important, but that rarely includes a strict recounting of my day. Part of my failure to commit is because I\u0026rsquo;m not heard. Writing down the important thoughts is a means to further elaboration and ultimately communication. Keeping a diary or \u0026ldquo;communicating\u0026rdquo; with God doesn\u0026rsquo;t satisfy the quality of being heard by people that aren\u0026rsquo;t me. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerhaps I\u0026rsquo;ve misunderstood the purpose of having a diary/talking with God. Maybe it lies in a distinction between meditation and therapy. Still, if writing our thoughts down is meditative (a discussion with ourself), then why do we need God? At first glance, it seems that keeping a diary, writing thoughts down, or talking to God all fulfill the same purpose of meditation. And talking with God can\u0026rsquo;t be therapy because it\u0026rsquo;s actually a conversation with another part of yourself.

The show survives on a diet primarily consisting of 80s and 90s dance music with support from new wave, no wave, ambient, and a little bit of rock 'n\u0026rsquo; roll.

Phil Jackson. How far you have fallen. When it comes to the NBA, Phil Jackson’s an icon.  He coached arguably 4 of the top 15 basketball players of all time. Including the G.OA.T. Michael Jordan. With his stint with the Chicago Bulls he coached 2 Three-peat teams. And to top it off he took his talents to the storied Los Angeles Lakers franchise and gave them 5 rings thanks to his tutelage of rising superstars, Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal.   \u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen, he retired. Then, he took his talents back to the New York Knicks where his affiliation with the NBA began back in the late 60s. But his talents weren’t in coaching this time around. No, he had the bright idea to become a GM. A job he’s never possessed — a fact which he is making more obvious with each passing day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePhil Jackson took over the Knicks with one objective: to bring a title back to arguably the greatest basketball stadium in the world, Madison Square Garden.  Instead he’s been plagued by odd hires at coach. First, Derek Fisher. Someone with no coaching experience and a slight penchant for dating his ex teammates ex wives. And now we have Jeff Hornacek, who coached one decent season in Phoenix, and then got canned the next losing season. And odd trades.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, his greatest issue of all — his tumultuous relationship with the new generation of superstars that don’t kneel down to kiss the ring because he’s failing to show them the respect they deserve. First, it was his spat with LeBron James where he had the audacity to call his friends and business partners his “posse”. This erupted a war of words, resulting in LeBron stating that he had lost respect for Phil, even going as far as to say that Greg Popovich was the best coach in the history of the NBA. Ouch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen came his outright complaints about his own, fading New York Knicks star, Carmelo Anthony. This is where things got the most interesting. When Phil Jackson came to the Knicks, he was tasked with building a winning team around Carmelo Anthony, and restoring the triangle offense back to its prominence in the NBA once again. The problem with this is that the triangle offense is outdated, and, no disrespect to Carmelo Anthony, but he’s no Jordan or Bryant. Plus, Anthony is not a two-way player in the same way that Jordan and Kobe were.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut that which has transpired most recently is a heavy mutual disliking between Phil Jackson and Carmelo Anthony, thanks to a 12th place standing record of 22-31 in the abysmal Eastern Conference. They are heading to their fourth losing season in a row. Why did this happen, once again? The Knicks were supposed to be poised to make the playoffs this year. Especially when Phil Jackson attracted the goodwill from fans for last year’s surprise 1st round draft pick, Kristap Porzingis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Knicks are going nowhere fast, and Phil Jackson is even resorting to sub tweeting.  Are we serious? He’s actually sub tweeting and throwing shade at Carmelo Anthony. Calling him a ball hog and someone who can’t change his ways. At the same time, he has all but publicly denounced Carmelo and put him on a trading block with virtually no teams willing to meet his demands because they themselves know how detrimental an aging, one-on-one player can be to their team chemistry.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePhil, you should be better than this. Do your GM job and stay out of the public media. Better yet, when the seasons over, do the Knicks fans a favor and quit.  Unfortunately, with Phil Jackson and Jeanie Buss ending their 4-year engagement last December, even the Los Angeles Lakers don’t appear to be a fallback for him. Maybe that’s for the better. Not the relationship ending, but the fact that he most likely won’t be their GM in the near future either. He’s tried that job already. And we’ve all seen enough. \u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By: Rohnie Williams\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date: 2/18/17\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou might have noticed that social media has gotten a little bit darker these days. People are lamenting their states left and right like some kind of shitty Shakespeare sonnet (29, to be exact). It isn’t because our new overlord is dropping executive orders like Stephen Curry drops 3’s, but it’s because the sadboy aesthetic has become mainstream. \u0009\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"200\" data-orig-width=\"355\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e6c1a164c0a07724f3cb413c3fd4a558/tumblr_inline_oll8qlBYJJ1qhakxc_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"200\" data-orig-width=\"355\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat is a sadboy? The sadboy is a person who takes one small discomfort in their life, usually relating to an inability to make a deep romantic connection, and blows it completely out of proportion (I’m talking Kilimanjaro out of an ant hill). The resulting manifestation is a whiny and dejected hopeless romantic who is constantly screaming to the sky, “Why Me?” They express their new aesthetic by writing sad statuses (saduses?) and tweets to make sure everyone knows just how sad they are.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe sadboy aesthetic can be seen rising in popularity mostly due to the efforts of Drake and his 2011 album, \u003ci\u003eTake Care\u003c/i\u003e. The album follows Drake’s rise to fame as a heavy-hitter in the rap game and as a global icon. However, he also reveals a dark side to his newfound success: no matter how much money and accolades you receive, without the love of a good and loyal woman your life is meaningless and empty. From then on, people all over indulged in the sadboy lifestyle, taking it beyond the internet and ritualistically exclaiming how hard it is to be alive. We can see the culmination of this aesthetic again in music, with the duo mansionz, a collaboration project between Mike Posner and Blackbear, and their new song called “rich white girlz.” In the song, both individuals explain the trouble with their infatuation for, well, rich white girls. Posner himself says, “I thought that the last tour would help me fill the hole/And then came the income, outcome I\u0026rsquo;m still alone.” However, at the end of the song, Snoozegod chimes in with, “Bear got like 30 [girls] in line [and] Mike got a couple in line.” While this doesn’t necessarily solve all of their problems, the fact remains that they have chosen one instance in their life, not totally out of their control, to focus on and be sad about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe trend of being a sadboy has ran its course. What we have on our hands, now, is too many people sulking around and grouping themselves with people who have real issues. Now, I’m not here to shame anyone who has undertaken the lifestyle and devoted their life to the cult of sorrow, but I am here as a disgruntled social media user. Sadboys have ruined my online experience because everybody and their dog is a sadboy. Everytime I go on Facebook or Twitter I’m bombarded with “ooooh I’m sad,” “ooooh why doesn’t anybody like me,” “ooooh I’m gonna die alone” (probably) and it’s honestly just depressing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, there is a new elite, a new underground, a new aesthetic. Trends will come and go but nobody wants to show up late to the party. The new party I’m talking about is the positivity posse, aka gladboys. These brave individuals post online about how beautiful life is and how lucky we are to be alive. Just as Drake, Mike Posner and Blackbear are the harbingers of sorrow, Chance the Rapper is the king of positivity, even going so far as to start the #positivitychallenge. As Chance grows in popularity with a few Grammy wins under his belt, we can only hope that social media will be bright once again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"200\" data-orig-width=\"356\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/55665cff194663f5713686f55af809c8/tumblr_inline_oll8s6YrFc1qhakxc_500.gif\" data-orig-height=\"200\" data-orig-width=\"356\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

Get festive every Wednesday morning with National Treasure! The show commemorates bizarre and obscure social media holidays each week, from #GourmetCoffeeDay to #LaughAndGetRichDay. DJ Amy keeps listeners engaged with the theme through fun activities - she even offered to give away a glass of milk in honor of #MilkDay.The celebrations are complemented with a “grab bag” of tunes - listeners are told to “get ready for some mid-2000’s hits scattered in between indie and weirdo music that I find on all corners of the internet.” The highlight of the show so far, according to DJ Amy, has been #DecoratingWithCandyDay, when she and co-host DJ Paleta con Chile featured candy related tracks and swapped uncomfortable Valentine’s Day stories - such as the time DJ Amy was given candy by her “valentine” even after she politely refused him. National Treasure is a little wacky, very fun, and a great excuse for some low-key festivities.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eListen in every Wednesday at 11 a.m. on \u003ca href=\"http://uclaradio.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003euclaradio.com\u003c/a\u003e.

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By: Julian Zhou\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date: 2/9/17\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"700\" data-orig-width=\"700\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dfc00624e56fdc966c22e5a502b2ae7a/tumblr_inline_ol5al7Wyxy1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"700\" data-orig-width=\"700\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eDo you like the 80s? Do you wear a choker? Do you have a Joy Division t-shirt? If so, I recommend you listen to Drab Majesty\u0026rsquo;s album, \u003ci\u003eThe Demonstration\u003c/i\u003e. There is a certain formula to Drab Majesty\u0026rsquo;s song-writing; an attitude towards which will determine if a listener appreciates this band. Expect syncopated, echoey snare hits, surprising chord changes, and chorused guitar arpeggios that demonstrate Drab Majesty\u0026rsquo;s dogmatic genre devotion to goth pop. This is a plus for me, though it may not be for you. There is no bass guitar — the synths have taken that role. The lyrical themes touch upon cult suicide, astral projection, gender fluidity, the occult, and other edge topics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe aesthetic of the group can best be described as “ice goth” — which, as far as I can tell, is part goth and part vapor, but not quite witch house. The two band members (Deb Demure and recent addition Mona D) perform as female, but their music aspires to achieve “genderless perfection” [Drab Majesty\u0026rsquo;s bandcamp, 2017]. Demure and D value theatricality, and use costumes and stage props such as rotating Greek busts, rose petals, shoji walls, and a fog machine, resulting in a very entertaining live show.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow let’s address some criticisms. A possible criticism of this album, as well as of Drab Majesty\u0026rsquo;s previous LP, \u003ci\u003eCareless \u003c/i\u003e(2015) is that both albums tend to be frontloaded with their most well-written songs. However, I find this criticism to be idiotic because in the computer era, we are not confined to listening to albums in the default order. Furthermore, this criticism presumes that albums should be evaluated as singular, cohesive work — an opinion, which I find to be rockist and regressive. \u003ci\u003eThe Demonstration\u003c/i\u003e is as much a dance album as it is a concept album, and it can be appreciated as a collection of singles. That being said, it is moodier and less dancey than \u003ci\u003eCareless\u003c/i\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is my first review and I have decided that instead of providing my own score, I will simply predict Pitchfork\u0026rsquo;s score when it reviews Drab Majesty. I predict it will give it no less than a 7.1, but no more than a 7.9 for being “derivative.” However, this is the sweet spot if you are looking for music that is good, yet not npr-core.\u003c/p\u003e",

Following the success of her single \u0026ldquo;Hide Away\u0026rdquo; and her featuring on the Chainsmokers banger \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t Let Me Down\u0026rdquo;, the artist released her new album \u003ci\u003eSit Still, Look Pretty\u003c/i\u003e, a work which displays her more mature side. It\u0026rsquo;s a unique mix between EDM pop and radio-Disney-friendly lyrics. Though it does show some improvements from her previous songs, Daya\u0026rsquo;s new album - if anything - is simply average.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe album is comprised of 14 tracks that all carry the manifesto of not being like “other girls”, as well as her battle to be desired for something other than her looks. While the album has been certified Platinum by the RIAA, it would seem that the album has not gained much recognition aside from the two singles, \u0026ldquo;Hide Away\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Sit Still, Look Pretty\u0026rdquo;. The production is clean and the tunes are easy to hear, but there is nothing special to it. It could easily serve as just being the background music inside a Starbuck\u0026rsquo;s coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile Daya’s style does incorporate the influence of Troye Sivan, it only shallowly encompasses that which Sivan is capable of. I am positive that with more time, her music will become more sophisticated and thought out in terms of meaning. Her lyrics carry a lot of weight and I am excited to see what she comes up with in the future. She is a musician on the rise and without a doubt someone to look out for. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe songs \u0026ldquo;Cool\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Dare\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Love of My Life\u0026rdquo; stand out and display her overall shift to an older, sound. If you are a fan of \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t Let Me Down\u0026rdquo;, then you should for sure check out the last song of her album \u0026ldquo;We Are.\u0026rdquo; Her voice really lends well to the song’s dance style of music. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, I would say Daya’s \u003ci\u003eSit Still, Look Pretty\u003c/i\u003e was fairly decent and did carry some potentially good tracks, earning it a rating of 6/10!\u003c/p\u003e",

I couldn\u0026rsquo;t think of an overriding theme. But then I just started thinking about our friendship, and how we’d drifted apart and then come back together again. And how crucial it is feeling seen in any sort of relationship. We hadn’t seen each other, and I needed that.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe xx is back, and they have returned with a beautiful album. \u003ci\u003eI See You\u003c/i\u003e was released January 13, a full five years after their previous album \u003ci\u003eCoexist\u003c/i\u003e. Much like \u003ci\u003eCoexist\u003c/i\u003e and their eponymous first album, \u003ci\u003eI See You\u003c/i\u003e delivers a first person narrative tracing the various stages of a relationship, from its reckless beginning to the reflective aftermath. Additionally, The xx’s writing still refrains from the use of gender pronouns, references to sexuality, or references to specific places or moments in time, establishing the universality of their motifs of loneliness and empathy. But different from prior works, this album feels much less like an ode to romantic love than a broader call for closeness in all forms. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, “Say Something Loving” mourns forgetting intimacy, with vocalists Oliver Sim and Madley Croft declaring, “I just don’t remember the thrill of affection\u0026hellip;I need a reminder, the feeling’s escaped me.” More than a lament about lacking romantic intimacy, the tone of “Say Something Loving” expresses a failure to connect with others as a frame for confronting the more unsettling loss of self. “Brave For You” also examines the self in relation to closeness with others, only this track centers around the impact a person can leave on another even after separation. Lyrics such as “And when I’m scared/I imagine you’re there/Telling me to be brave,” are written for Madley Croft’s parents, both of whom have passed away. Yet these words strike a chord in any listener learning to live with relationships that are either gone or broken. While the xx’s hauntingly clear vocals and unadorned melodies certainly create a preternatural listening experience, their music unearths one of the most human feelings of all, the search for a connection.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite the melancholy lyrical themes that pervade \u003ci\u003eI See You\u003c/i\u003e, the dynamic synth beats and samples prevent the songs from becoming depressing or moody beyond redemption. The range of samples is diverse; a Hall \u0026amp; Oates track makes an appearance, as does one by Alessi. Contrast between brisk instrumentals and melancholy vocal content has the potential to produce a muddled or haphazard sound, but instead the two components complement each other well. Perhaps paralleling the condition of understanding oneself through intimacy with others, the interplay between profoundly personal vocal performances, and outside samples forge a sound that resonates and unites.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFavorite tracks of the album: “On Hold” and “Replica”\u003c/p\u003e",

Coming from a liberal household, I did not expect my family to avoid the topic of politics when I came home, but in fact I was wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Don’t talk about the election when you are home,” my mother said as I prepared to exit the car outside my house. I was shocked with the only thoughts that ran through my head being:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1. What a strange request to come from my pro-Clinton mother.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2. Will there still be stuffing this year?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3. I’m a political science major, that’s all I know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e4. I mean I can deal with no turkey, but stuffing?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e5. Does that mean someone voted for you-know-who?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e6. Stuffing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I asked what any liberal arts college student coming home for the holidays would in a situation such as this - “Who voted for Trump?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“No one, what, why would you ask that?” she responded, furrowing her brows at my question. “Dad just doesn’t like how upset the household gets when we talk about it.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI furrowed my brows. She furrowed her brows even more, as if it were a competition of furrowing brows, which in this case it definitely was.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI, of course, was not done investigating the issue of discussing politics (or brow furrowing for that matter) and thus went directly to the most active member of the family group chat, my brother. If anyone knew what was going down on the frontlines of family discourse, it was him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Let’s talk politics.” Richard swiveled in his office chair as I entered his room after five minutes in the household, as if waiting for my arrival.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Who voted Trump?” I responded.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I think Dad did.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“What?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I said it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“No.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Yes.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Are you sure?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Not hundred percent, but\u0026hellip;”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Well mom said everyone voted Clinton.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“You don’t know that.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“But he voted Bernie in the primaries,” I responded, furrowing my brows in confusion. My father could not have voted Trump, he was my father, he was my mother’s husband, he was a huge Bernie supporter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“He gets annoyed when we talk about the election,” my brother shrugged. “But you never know. Anyway did you hear about the recount in Wisconsin with Jill Stein? In my opinion, they should be doing it in Michigan there was a closer margin in that state….”  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI nodded as my thoughts became clouded with the idea that my house was a house truly divided by political ideology. Was this what all my friends were worrying about back on campus, about dealing with a household split by the election? Was this now my reality? Would there be stuffing? So of course I went straight to the source, my father, regarding the issue with my furrowed brow and the fear that my brother was right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Dad, I need to ask you a question,” I bravely stuttered as he put down his yoga mat and looked over at me. My father had picked up yoga as his drug of choice ever since retirement, and thus had acquired at least four more mats in the past two years, for what? I still do not know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Yes?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Will there be stuffing this year?” I asked nervously.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I’m pretty sure, we always have stuffing. But no alcohol or pork, your brother’s girlfriend’s family is coming over and they are Muslim.” He responded putting away his yoga blocks. “They are a really sweet family, so best behavior. And please Jen, no politics at the table.” \u003c/p\u003e",

Opening up for them was their own keyboard player, Will Sprott, and cumbia-punk band Thee Commons. Will played guitar and sang with a female bassist and female drummer, who were noticeably out of synch at times. The trio apologized at the end for sounding a little off, admitting that they weren’t actually a well established band and hadn’t practiced in a while. Nonetheless, the trio’s beachy 60’s sound made for a good segway into the more chaotic performance put on by Thee Commons.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’ve legitimately never seen more energy on a stage than what I saw during their set. Thee Commons, a trio from East L.A., puts a Latin twist on garage rock to produce a unique psychedelic cumbia punk sound. They reminded me a lot of Sublime, except their songs were less reggae and more rock and roll influenced. Unfortunately I don’t know any of their songs so I can’t identify what exactly they played, but all of it was very fast tempoed, upbeat, and loud. Accompanying the wild music was a colorful, erratic light show that illuminated the band’s eccentric stage antics; both guitarists played dramatically and enthusiastically, darting around the stage and dropping to their knees as if the music was literally overtaking them. At one point they both put on wolf masks and prowled around the stage, which was creepy as hell but actually very cool. The energy in the crowd matched that of the band - people were moshing fearlessly to the aggressive music. At the end, a bunch of people joined the band on stage, including someone in a really freaky looking gorilla costume. Thee Commons was definitely the most wild act of the night.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"4025\" data-orig-height=\"2291\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/09e89cfe7040a36912514863503e47d2/tumblr_inline_omd8b2392y1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4025\" data-orig-height=\"2291\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e I’d say that the headliner, Shannon and the Clams, was pretty much a combination of their two openers. They played a very diverse set, performing some of their upbeat, bubblegum songs off \u003ci\u003eGone By the Dawn\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eDreams in the Rat House\u003c/i\u003e that sound like they could be from a 60’s pop  album. In contrast to these, they showed off their garage rock side, playing harsher sounding songs that incited overwhelming moshing in the crowd, as opposed to the twisting and dancing that occurred during the doo-wop songs. They also played a couple new tracks, which were a little slower and more folky than the others, meaning that they probably have a new album coming out soon (yay!). They didn’t give titles for any of the new songs, but Cody said to the crowd before the first one, “You better like it.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough the overall moods of the songs were different, lead singers Shannon and Cody were consistently impressive throughout the show. Shannon’s low, husky growl paired perfectly with Cody’s high-pitched, raspy voice, and it’s crazy to me that they’re able to recreate the harmonies from their records so well in concert. They complemented each other in not only their voices, but in their wacky appearances as well. Shannon was wearing a funky, 40’s reminiscent sailor outfit, and Cody donned a cape that looked like it was made out of burlap.Their demeanor was definitely calmer than those of Thee Commons, but the passion was evidently still there. Shannon was such a sweetheart, and gave out little pieces of advice and adoration throughout their set. Overall, the show was entertaining, energetic, and diverse. It was definitely a Sunday night well spent.\u003c/p\u003e",

Did it occur to you suddenly in a moment of brilliance, or was this a gradual labor of love?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDoris\u003c/b\u003e: The initial idea was to have a show that was grandma themed. We went in the first episode and decided we would have a segment analyzing some song lyrics of a new rap song, but once we were in the booth, that part just really took off. There was just too much good music for us not to continue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMildred\u003c/b\u003e: When discussing what we wanted to do for our show, Doris and I both identified deeply as old souls and at times felt like two grandmothers living in a young person’s world. Senile Soiree began as an exploration of elderly lifestyle but thanks to D.R.A.M. and Lil Yachty, it evolved into an exploration of rap lyrics through an elderly perspective and we haven’t looked back since. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat is the developmental process behind putting together such a creative show with two hosts? Is it mostly improv or are decisions made together in advance? What makes the two of you such a fabulous duo?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDoris\u003c/b\u003e: For the most part it’s improv. We will come in with a theme or maybe some songs we heard and were really interested in analyzing, but the analysis and banter is off the cuff. Mildred came on my show last spring, and we had so much fun that we just had to make it more of a thing. We have good on air chemistry which is what makes Senile Soirée so easy and so much fun. We are able to get in the booth and just talk, and hash things out in a really organic way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMildred\u003c/b\u003e: Yeah, aside from the songs that we decide to play on air each week, the show is mostly improv. Sometimes we might pick a theme for the show and make some talking points off of that, or if we are doing an activity like knitting or drinking prune juice, we’ll plan that out first. After having so much fun as a guest on Doris’s show last year we decided to do a show together this year. Plus, Doris and I are good pals off air so I think that really helps us have such great chemistry on air. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1604\" data-orig-width=\"2048\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9d0b17485a25433954d58b591aa681d7/tumblr_inline_om21o1D8Zq1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1604\" data-orig-width=\"2048\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2\u003eYour show centers around old people confronted with music in the modern world.

I think some of the classic oldies will be Drake, Yeezy, Kendrick, and Chance. Maybe Thugger too. But that is a scary thought. I wonder what they will all look like at 85… \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMildred\u003c/b\u003e: Honestly, the first person that always comes to mind for me is Beyonce. I also agree with Doris about Kanye and Kendrick for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSimilarly, what current music do you hope will be buried in the past forever?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDoris\u003c/b\u003e: I don’t know if there is anything I really hope will be buried. A lot of what our show goes into is how our culture and the music we listen to reflect on each other, so I think all music has a story that is important to someone. That being said, I don’t need to hear Katy Perry ever again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMildred\u003c/b\u003e:  I don’t think anyone wants Nickelback to come back.

Kant? Kant. He’s the philosopher that caused a breakout on my roommates pore-less face during fall quarter. She cried about it and almost switched her major to chemistry. Kant’s a priori rhetoric is on the tip of my tongue, but it lingers and melts into my taste buds. I gulp. I can’t recall it exactly. It’s hot, even for an LA day in February, but Charlotte hip-hop artist, Jalen Santoy, is composed, and smiling. “Kant is my favorite philosopher. I had to take a break for a while, but he’s still my favorite. I like to test my pen.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSantoy’s demeanor is inviting and playful. He asks genuine questions and goes out of his way to make eye contact. He visited UCLA Radio for an interview on February 4 and talked about his latest EP, \u003ci\u003eCharlie Eastern\u003c/i\u003e, named after his late cousin who passed at the hands of a police officer. With over 13 million hits on Spotify and a thriving career ahead of him, Santoy has every reason not to be humble. But he is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I love all types of instruments, but I wouldn’t say jazz is my only influence. I grew up listening to a lot of Jay-Z, Tupac… but I don’t want to be compared to any of them. J Cole has done a lot for North Carolina in general and I definitely look up to him in some lights. I have respect for his craft, but I have respect for mine as well. You can’t be mad at another person’s reality\u0026hellip; in a sense it’s all subjective,” he says. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSantoy’s most famous song, “Foreplay,” is rooted in traditional jazz sound, with the saxophone and bass drum carrying the melody from beginning to finish. \u003ci\u003eCharlie Eastern\u003c/i\u003e depicts the story of a coming of age man, experiencing heartbreak, death, and a means to be the life of the party, especially if that means wearing a mink in the summer. The messages in each song resonate with listeners for all different reasons, and prove that Santoy has a focused vision for his life. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1365\" data-orig-width=\"2048\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6cda8aae5d22fa9490b797eee36894d1/tumblr_inline_olp4s7ztOl1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1365\" data-orig-width=\"2048\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis relationship with his mom stands out the most.

She heard it on the radio, and it was a moment for her. She cried.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI asked about Black Lives Matter and his politicized messaging in his lyrics. “I want my music to stand for progression and social awareness.. I don’t want that all to be my music embodies, but it’s a platform I want my music to standby. A lot of dilemmas that we deal with socially\u0026hellip; it can be solved with awareness. You can have communication about it, but once you find ways to make the awareness intentful and find ways to change things, that’s when I think things are going to change,” he says. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis thought resonates with me and I immediately question the intermingling of hip hop and politics. Two frameworks - two philosophies - all made for the same purpose? I wonder. “The most that resonate with people are what resonates within their society.. Politics isn’t as personal. In hip-hop, we don’t have the masses that politics embodies, but we have a culture and a following,” he explains.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSantoy’s music isn’t strictly political. His hit “Off the Glass” of his EP is catchy and should be remixed during college and club DJ sets. Paying ode to Jordan Belford of \u003ci\u003eWolf of Wall Street\u003c/i\u003e, I picture good girls rapping the chorus. “I’d rather wear a mink in the summer,” creates the perfect visual of irony and spontaneity. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2017, Santoy plans on developing his sound, landing some concerts, and putting out more music. He’s never spent a summer in LA. I told him, “I will buy you a mink if you wear it in the summer. On the beach. In Venice. We will make a music video.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eSummer 2017, we’re coming for you. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1365\" data-orig-width=\"2048\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dc96343c26e5271df679ad0b05b03cf3/tumblr_inline_olp4sn0M5g1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1365\" data-orig-width=\"2048\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By: Malik D. Flournoy-Hooker  \u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date: 2/15/17\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eImagine coming home from a long, strenuous day. The first thing you want to do is take a hot shower, maybe cook a meal, or have a cup of tea. As you turn on your water, you realize that something is not right. The water is cloudy, polluted, and extremely ominous. This was the reality of the citizens of Flint, Michigan.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn August 14, 2014, Flint received notice that fecal coliform bacteria has been detected within their water supply—an infestation that has been recorded in previous years before this huge breakout. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLess than a month later, on September 5, another advisory was announced about the discovery of possibly more toxic bacteria living within the water supply. Citizens of Flint began reporting hair and weight loss, and rashes. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough steps have been taken in response to this, it still remains an issue years later. To give you a bit of perspective, reports of bacteria being detected within the water supply began in 2001. The “Flint Water Crisis” officially began in 2014. 16 years of strife, compiled with three years of it actually being reported, has done seemingly nothing but bring awareness to the matter. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere have been several fundraisers created in response to the crisis, which have done well in bringing fresh water to the citizens and visibility to the issue. However, due to a strong preference of policy over people by the current government in Flint, there doesn’t seem to be a sense of urgency to get the problem resolved.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFlint is predominantly African-American and disadvantaged. According the U.S. Census Bureau, most households in Flint make an income around $24,000. There are some people who chose to make the assumption that race and class played a large role in this development. The government could have possibly not seen it as an urgent need to ensure Flint’s drinking water was healthy because its citizens were of a lower class. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eReports show that Darnell Earley was the one responsible for switching the water system in Flint from Detroit back to the polluted river. Earley was the former Flint Emergency Manager and also one of the four people who were charged for the crisis. The other three people were Gerald Ambrose, the former emergency manager, and city officials Daugherty Johnson and Howard Croft. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe court argued that the four had adequate knowledge of the contamination and still chose to conduct the Flint Water Treatment Plant—an option they knew would not be safe. The defendants were said to have borrowed money to construct a new pipeline, while switching Flint’s water supply to the Flint River during the process. All four were charged with conspiracy and false pretenses. Ambrose and Earley were also charged with willful neglect of duty and misconduct—these charges combined carry up to 20 years in a federal prison. Verdicts are still being determined as of now, but there is still something we all can do in the meantime and continue doing until this is resolved.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBelow are some links that will take you to the official page for the crisis and another link to direct you to ongoing efforts to distribute more clean water to Flint’s residents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFind out more information:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/flint-water-%20crisis/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/flint-water-crisis/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://www.gofundme.com/flint-water-crisis/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.helpforflint.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.helpforflint.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Fortunately, rage does not die with age. Ty Segall’s second self-titled album is raw and concise. In self-titling an album for a second time, I was led to compare this album to his first self-titled release from 2008. While his sound has noticeably matured, he has held onto his characteristically youthful energy. This energy bled into the crowd, resulting in the entirety of my middle-aged companions moshing. Glued to the side of the stage, I was torn. A part of me knew desperately clinging to my camera in effort to keep it from being thrown to the ground or drenched in the storm of beer flying from the crowd’s overfilled cups was the smart decision, but the crowd drew me in. Lost in the vitality of the set, there was a strange harmony within the collisions of the crowd. I decided to compromise. After exchanging a knowing look with the guitarist, I placed my camera on the stage, safely tucked beside the speaker, and let myself temporarily neglect my responsibilities of observing and documenting and fully experience the moment. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"670\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b23d62e9252f403b0799f7aee3f84b1c/tumblr_inline_ol8aql3sjw1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"670\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"854\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc90789fa447718d1b799b1cd7a2f3c0/tumblr_inline_ol8aqnuJdx1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"854\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eI returned to my spot, now slightly bruised, directly in front of the speaker. Ty exchanged loving looks of affection with his bandmates during particularly rambunctious parts of the songs. Though for the majority of the set, I could not hear Ty’s vocals due to my proximity to the excessive, yet appropriate, volume on the speakers, the songs matched his distinctive sound. When the opening chords of “Break a Guitar,” the opening track on his latest album, were played, the crowd immediately erupted in the excitement that precedes a classic, despite the album having been released only days before. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"858\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ec11368b3db98f177f8a1111c5e62813/tumblr_inline_ol8aqk0GiS1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"858\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"878\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3a3fc0ce5422dce86397489d12cf1940/tumblr_inline_ol8aqqVQ6D1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"878\" data-orig-width=\"1280\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eA mature rendition of his jazzy fuzz punk sound, Ty Segall delivered an unprecedented performance that Thursday night at the Teragram Ballroom.

In a phone interview with Vidmar, otherwise known as the solo artist of ‘Shy Girls,’ he explains the concept behind his latest album \u003ci\u003eSalt\u003c/i\u003e, and talks about his upcoming tour. Vidmar is unabatingly proud of this album, in which he played all of the instruments excluding the strings. As he bounces back and forth from his favorite town Portland and LA, he finds himself caught in the grind of two distinct cultures. “Portland is home for me. I’ve been in LA the past few months and have been working on this album for a little more than a year.. I’m just happy to be able to make a living off of this,” he says.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThere are some dark moments in the album, and he was able to translate the darkness onto the stage at the Teragram Ballroom on January 28. Tiffany Gouche open the show, and as the crowd immerses themselves in the intimate room Fangirls anxiously sip their beers and set their cocktails on the stage. There was enough room to wiggle around to the front, and if you weren’t with any guys, you could gingerly find a way to maneuver through the blue and purple lit room.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRoadies scold the pretty girls for leaving their drinks so close to the mic on stage. A brunette with overfilled lips cringes in between sips of gin. “I’ve never heard of this guy. I’m trying to explore my vocal range…some of my agents keep it real. I just need to define my style, ya know? That’s why I don’t wear leather anymore,” she comments. The girls in the audience are grown up embodiments of the Aaron Carter fangirl era and dismiss theater etiquette for the sake of Vidmar’s approval. But he would never approve.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1550\" data-orig-width=\"2325\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8874fbebd513bc57a5dcf21cf9d06d73/tumblr_inline_oktj5xJDla1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1550\" data-orig-width=\"2325\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eVidmar speaks assertively over the phone. He’s well-spoken and clearly knows what he stands for. “I think as an artist I’m not very good at politicizing my sounds and music. Some people are extremely good at infusing that in their music\u0026hellip;I think that’s really important,” he says. “ I think that the art that I make is more. Sometimes there isn’t a place for politics in music at all.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn stage, he acknowledges the new immigration ban that was signed as an executive order earlier that day. After the first song, “Trivial Motion,” he pauses. Silence fills the ballroom as dedicated fans melt into the floorboards. Sexuality and longing oozes from Vidmar’s vocal range, and within the first song, is able to captivate the audience by conceptualizing the image of intimacy. “It’s a sad day for a lot of us…and I hope for the next hour I can distract you from what’s happening. That’s what I’m here for,” he says. He transitions into the next few songs off his new album seamlessly, playing “Watercolor Dreams,” “You Like the Pain Too,” and “Say You Will.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Everything that I write about is real\u0026hellip;maybe I’m not a good enough storyteller,” Vidmar says as he discusses the romance behind each song. Midway through the set, he plays older music, including “Renegade,” “Under Attack,” and “Xhampagne.” Vidmar’s shyness is apparent. He doesn’t make eye contact and refuses to move around on stage. And yet, the crowd gets more restless. They need more. Cue the saxophone. On stage, a band plays the variety of instruments, and Vidmar pays ode to the saxophone player by standing to the side of the stage and allowing the spotlight to literally shine on him through his moments of glory.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It’s funny, I didn’t know how far this would take me, until I wrote this next song… I sent it to my friends and I’ve been making music ever since,” he says. He makes the second to last song of the set his most popular, “Second Heartbeat.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1550\" data-orig-width=\"2325\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6235057eca2954780b731734e3449e1c/tumblr_inline_oktj6phc8Z1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1550\" data-orig-width=\"2325\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the phone, Vidmar is optimistic about future romance and his thriving career. “My Tinder game isn’t on point… but my Bumble game is,” He says with a chuckle. Stay tuned to see Shy Girls in LA more these days at his favorite bar, West Bound, and remember to swipe right on Bumble, ladies.\u003c/p\u003e",

This has left their front office looking in the mirror, forced to evaluate the moves the team made this off-season. They currently sit at 20-16, a record good enough to rank them fourth in the East. The team appears to be set for a middle playoff seed in the East, at best a first round victory. They pose no real threat to the conference leading Cavs. Their front office is now forced to ask themselves: are we good enough?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Flying north of the border to Toronto, Dwane Casey’s bunch is right on the heels of Cleveland. They stand at second in the conference with a 24-11 record, leaving them two and half games behind the Cavs. Last season, they took Cleveland to six games in the Eastern Conference Finals. The franchise\u0026rsquo;s best seasons by winning percentages are this one, and the three years previous. This core group - built around Kyle Lowry and Demar Derozan\u0026ndash; is setting franchise records in wins. But when considering their ability to actually beat the Cavs in a playoff series, we are forced to ask ourselves: are they good enough? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009There are many ways to characterize “good enough.” The owners must think about profit much more than we as fans do.

They sure are good, but when is good enough?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, the Hawks have an emerging point guard in Dennis Schroder, an all-star in Paul Millsap, and a reinvigorated hometown hero in Dwight Howard. Fourth in the conference isn’t too bad either. But if the sole goal is to win a championship, then both teams have some serious self-reflection to do. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The Hawks need to reboot and build their team with younger players. Howard and Millsap are both 31. The timetables don’t line-up between the progression of their young players and the abilities of their established hoopers. Plus Millsap has a player option for the upcoming year, and he could opt out to try to cash in on one more long term contract in today’s fountain-of-fortunes NBA. In all, it looks like their best option is trade Millsap for as much youthful talent as they can get, setting their sights on contention in three to four years. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The sell is tougher for the Raptors. They are in the midst of unprecedented success for their franchise. There is a lot at risk, a lot to lose. At the same time, most teams would kill to be in their position for one reason: opportunity. They are one player away, a couple lucky injuries away, a couple insane performances from their stars away from really competing for a title. Few teams have had an opportunity to be this close; why not put all your chips in to try to win a title?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The Raptors are limited primarily because of their defense and rebounding. While they pace the league in offensive rating (points scored per 100 possessions), they are fifteenth in defensive rating. There is little precedent for teams to win a title without a top offense and defense. Even more telling, they’re twenty third in defensive rebound percentage. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Millsap would go a long way to plugging these holes. He is the best heavy minutes defender on the Hawks, who sport the fifth best defensive rating in the league. Among rotation players on the Hawks, he has the third best defensive rating, first among players who play more than 20 minutes per game. He brings a needed agility to the power-forward spot, allowing him to chase around quicker players and unlock a faster overall defensive scheme. This would allow the Raptors to switch on more picks, which is beneficial against any team, but almost necessary against the Warriors. He is second on the team in steals, a testament to his elite hands for his position. He is eleventh in the league in defensive rebounds per game among non centers, so he would boost the Raptors in that category. He is also a great size to match up with Lebron - this is key for any team that wants to take down the Cavs. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009In addition, he would make their league best offense even better. His ability to hit the three would open up more driving lanes for Derozan and Lowry. He is also a great playmaker\u0026ndash;averaging 3.7 assists per game\u0026ndash; which would allow for better ball movement and more off-ball Lowry. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Now the question is: can this happen? Both teams could stand to benefit from the trade, but are they willing to give up enough so that both are willing to do it? Do the Raptors have the best offer available of interested teams? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009A trade of Millsap for Terrence Ross, Pascal Siakam, Jared Sullinger, and a protected first round pick could be the move that pushes both organizations in the right direction. Ross is having a career year. As the leading scorer off of their bench, he is shooting 45.8 percent from the field and 38.1 percent from deep. His efficiency in this role shows that he could be ready for a bigger one. Wings are in high demand in today\u0026rsquo;s NBA, so nabbing a budding one brings a lot of value. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Siakam offers high upside at the power forward spot. He’s athletic and plays hard on defense, showing a match of physicality and quickness that is key for modern NBA power forwards. He can dribble well too, and has an intuitive feel for the pick and roll. He offers much more upside than Poeltl, which makes him more enticing for a team looking at growth instead of instant production. Plus he plays the four instead of the five, so he could play with Howard. Based on their playing time, the Raps would probably rather give up Poetel (10.9 minutes per game) than Siakam (18.1 minutes per game). But if the Hawks are willing to accept this trade, then Masai Ujiri has got to pull the trigger. Throw in Sullinger to balance the cap, and the trade could pass through. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The Raptors have some interesting prospects. The Nuggets are rumored to be interested, and they’re stocked with a lot of good young players, yet they don’t offer a stunning amount of upside. They could be at play too, but the Raptors have more enticing individual assets. The Kings really don’t have any interesting young players to offer. The Celtics are stocked with assets, and could look to make a trade for Millsap, but they may be looking for a younger star. The Sixers are at least a couple years from contention; they really don’t have much of an incentive to trade for him. In all, the Raptors have some of the best assets to offer, and easily have the most incentive to acquire a player like Millsap. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The Raptors need to step up their defense if they want to really compete with the Cavs in the East. The Hawks need to cash in on Millsap before he becomes a free agent, netting as many young assets as possible. It’s looking clear that both teams need to make a move to get to contender status. Their paths there are increasingly looking like they will cross. \u003c/p\u003e",

Disoriented and confused, the crowd stared eagerly ahead, and as the clock struck ten, it was apparent: the headliner would have to be fashionably late. AlunaGeorge doesn’t use a rulebook and breaks down the fourth wall of audience-connection. Aluna’s subtle eye contact and hand gestures tell a story that are only told within the confines of a best kept secret. Using her body as a work of art, Aluna’s willowy figure took to the stage to reconcile our disconnect with R\u0026amp;B. She makes the distorted image of a strong black woman a narrative to be proud of, and within minutes, her magnetic claim to the stage steered the ship in her favor: she was in control.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eStarting the set with the 2013 classic, “Your Drums, Your Love,” Aluna made use of all sides of the stage and embraced the mic as if it were a lover. Throughout the song, she made dynamic facial expressions and connected to the lyrics, using grandiose theatrics and hip-shakes to exude sexuality. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e“When I’m in control, things go really fucking well.” She paused as the first song ended. “And I mean, really well,” she explained, as she wrinkled her face and grabbed her crotch. The beat to “I’m in Control” started, and in that moment, the audience came to a heightened memory of sexual experience. This was a wet dream come to life. This is what memories are made of.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAluna’s ability to own her sexuality while still maintaining a tasteful sense of style and dignity is unbeknownst to traditional R\u0026amp;B. Her uncompromising demeanor is remnant of the flapper era of the 1920s in allowing women to be frank about what they like in the bedroom. In a world where R\u0026amp;B style has integrated with other dimensions of EDM, Aluna’s blend of traditional sound with unconventional wisdom has created a new realm of understanding. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"2667\" data-orig-width=\"4000\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/236b2d5d5d37d722ed2eba1ccecfe401/tumblr_inline_oieumvkzKG1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"2667\" data-orig-width=\"4000\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAluna paused to acknowledge what weird world we are living in. “This election….” she said, trailing off with a shy smile and shook her head. “We’re here to have fun.” Her British accent legitimized her agenda and she jumped into newer songs.  Transitioning back and forth from old to new, the set list was unpredictable and upbeat. Including songs “Diver,” and her own rendition of “White Noise” by Disclosure, her vocal range revealed that not only she can mesh with a variety of sounds, but also demand attention in its acoustic moments. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eMidway through the set, Aluna re-emerges, wearing a bright red kimono and accompanied by a live horn-band, consisting of trumpet and trombone players. Languishing control for these moments, the artist took to left stage and allowed the live music to lead the song, “Full Swing,” from the newest album, \u003ci\u003eI Remember\u003c/i\u003e. As Aluna’s voice faded to the background, the trumpet’s sound became the loudest in the room. The audience paused. People stopped dancing. Boyfriends stole sips from their girlfriend’s drinks over their shoulders. The attraction was no longer anticipating what would happen next, but instead, the sense of nostalgia that came from remembering that live bands are what gave R\u0026amp;B life. Time stood still as we watched Aluna become so powerless, and yet so demanding as she gave the traditional horn sound a chance to reemerge as a defining piece of art.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the last note to the trumpet cued and the spotlights shifted, rapper Pell took to the stage with a surprise performance of his part on “Full Swing,” and with high energy, he and Aluna got the crowd on their feet again. Aluna asked how the crowd how they’re doing, and to  a response of loud cheers, she finished the night with the radio favorite, “You Know You like it.” Teasing us with the last note of sensual superiority, the crowd left thinking, “We definitely do.” \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Yet, even with such a dominant record, the Bruins’ future is still unclear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLonzo Ball has lived up to the hype, while T.J. Leaf, the other superstar freshman, has put up continually impressive numbers. In spite of such strong performances, the Bruins still appear to have deep flaws in their system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s take a brief look at the Bruins’ three loses. All have come within conference play.  All were manageable matchups for the Bruins. And all could have been avoided without such a heavy reliance on the Bruins’ offensive capability.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe recent thriller against Oregon — in which the Bruins came back for redemption against a wide margin — should give some hope for the Westwood fans.  It is also key reminder that the Bruins do best when they are considered the underdog.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLook at the first top-10 matchup of the year against Kentucky.  While Kentucky has been stronger in previous years, it was still projected to be a tough, but winnable game for the Wildcats. With this win, the Bruins gained a sense of confidence and swagger that carried them on to a significant winning streak.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut this win also revealed the vulnerability of the Bruins’ offense. The Bruins can certainly go shot-for-shot with any team in the nation, but if they have an inconsistent shooting night, their defense struggles to keep up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn each of their losses this season, the Bruins were ranked higher than their opponents. The underdog mentality, therefore, was nonexistent in the locker room. Couple that with a lackadaisical defense and a subpar (all relative) shooting night, and you end up with a tough loss.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is not to say that the Bruins will be unable to manage themselves in the tournament.  Thankfully, defense is not necessarily dependent on skill. Defense is about effort and how hard you’re willing to work to prevent your opponent from scoring.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, defense also comes at a price. Because the Bruins lack depth off the bench, Ball has been playing a significant portion of each game. While he is a supernatural athlete, Ball will get tired. And, when this happens, the whole team struggles because he is not only an offensive threat, but a game manager on the court.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlayers like Ball, Leaf, and Alford might have to put their offensive capabilities aside and focus on the hustle, rather than just the finesse. Coach Alford must harp on his players who decide to take a possession off because, as we know from experience, every possession matters in March.\u003c/p\u003e",

I took the Greyhound bus down to see the show for my birthday and as a first time user of this bus I would give it a huge thumbs down. Luckily though, the show redeemed my shitty travel experience. SOMA is in a good location but it’s a pretty weird looking venue - the front of it literally just looks like a rundown storefront and the inside is small, intimate, and dimly lit. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDoors opened at 3 pm, and the 11 opening bands alternated from the mainstage to the side stage. I got there late, but just in time to see the Buttertones. I’ve seen them twice before, but this time there was a decidedly more eager anticipation in the crowd; everyone was shoving their way up to the front before the band even took to the stage. In true Buttertones fashion, they played on the tiny, intimate side stage and were within touching distance. Each member embraced his signature individual look, and as a group they resembled a band from the 60’s, which paired nicely with lead singer Richard Araiza’s distinct, old fashioned style of singing. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey played songs from all of their albums and EPs, including “Bad Girl” off \u003ci\u003eFor the Head and for the Feet \u003c/i\u003e(my personal favorite), “Baby Doll” and “Connie” off \u003ci\u003eAmerican Brunch\u003c/i\u003e, and “Luna Estupenda” off \u003ci\u003eThe Buttertones\u003c/i\u003e. They also played “Sadie’s A Sadist,” a single released this month as a sample of their upcoming record \u003ci\u003eGravedigging\u003c/i\u003e which will be released March 25. The crowd was going absolutely nuts in the mosh pit the entire time they were playing, which was to be expected from their intense and fast-tempoed set. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Garden, an eccentric, odd duo of brothers Wyatt and Fletcher Shears from Orange County, also performed. Their performance was bizarre, energetic, and undeniably entertaining. Both clad in cropped leather jackets, feathered haircuts, and dangly earrings, the Garden twins darted around stage, doing somersaults, sometimes pausing to play the drums, all the while reciting (I say reciting, because it hardly qualified as singing) some of their strange, punchy songs like “All Smiles Over Here :)” off their album \u003ci\u003ehaha\u003c/i\u003e. I’m not a huge fan of their music as their voices are (in my opinion) unimpressive and their songs are chaotic and jumbled, however I have to admit that they know how to put on a wild performance. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere were a few more bands in between, including the Long Beach based Tijuana Panthers, who were incredibly good live. The highlight of the night, though, was of course the headliner and hosts of the show, The Frights. Richard (bass), Mikey (lead guitar/vocalist), Marc (drums) and a guest guitarist whom I didn’t recognize played on the main stage in their traditional casual attire of t-shirts and pants. Joining them onstage were cardboard cutouts of Donald Trump, Danny Devito, and the Harry Potter cast, which were periodically tossed into the crowd throughout the show. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3428\" data-orig-width=\"3018\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/27a0e2a96380270d766b29c0b2fd7f58/tumblr_inline_olyaknm5YM1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3428\" data-orig-width=\"3018\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Frights’ set was thankfully an hour long as opposed to the openers, who only played 30 minutes each. In their 60 minutes on stage they played a little bit of everything; half of \u003ci\u003eYou Are Going To Hate This\u003c/i\u003e, half of \u003ci\u003eThe Frights\u003c/i\u003e, and “Makeout Point” off of \u003ci\u003eFur Sure\u003c/i\u003e. They even threw in a cover of “April 29, 1992” by Sublime and, iconically, “All Star” by Smash Mouth. To end the set, they played “Beach Porn” off their EP \u003ci\u003eDead Beach\u003c/i\u003e, which is a classic Frights moshing song that they “retired” but will usually play at the pleading requests of the crowd. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, the set was amazing, and I, as always, was impressed by the instrumentation and how true it was to their records. The Frights are not only great live musicians, but have a refreshingly humble persona. The whole band seemed so genuinely happy to be playing, and Mikey kept repeating how thankful he was to the fans. Overall, I was impressed with the venue, the lineup, and the Frights for their hosting of the second You Are Going 2 Hate This Fest. I actually ~did not~ hate it and I’m excited for next year’s show! \u003c/p\u003e",

He exclaims that people have “played themselves” for having doubted Migos, and effectively contributes nothing to the track. It is thankfully unintrusive throughout the rest of the intro cut, which is carried by the trap production brought to the table by 808mafia. The rubbery 808 bass hits, flipbook-esque hi-hats, and subtle claps take center stage on many verses throughout the album. The majority of the melodies are carried by Migos themselves as they deliver their iconic, chopped flows on many cuts of the record. This turn-taking dynamic performed by Offset, Quavo, and Takeoff is repeated on songs such as “Call Casting”, “Get Right Witcha”, “Big on Big” and “Deadz”.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, as the album continues into the latter half, this dynamic proves to be extremely formulaic. It also prevents many of the beats’ melodies to fall far behind everything else in the mix. At the same time, not all of the hooks on here are as catchy as some of the hooks that Quavo has delivered on other tracks where he is listed as a feature. The stickiest hook is found on “All Ass”, another 808mafia slapper that works as a late night, sparkling strip club anthem. The synths that compose the melody have a sexy touch of reverb that slide around with the Quavo and Offset’s auto-tuned croons. The lyrical content of the song lines up with the themes of the rest of the album: beautiful women, piles of cash, fancy cars, jewelry, and putting enemies in their place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe album is clearly a statement of Migos’ intention to continue holding the reigns of the South with a relentless grip. The song “Deadz” is the most persistent track off the record. The same hook and refrain are repeated without much charm for the first minute, and again every other 30 seconds or so thereafter. Despite the fact that most songs fall past the 4 minute mark, the songs are validated by the presence that Migos creates. The trio makes sure to keep the spotlight on their names despite the fact that there are competitive features by Lil Uzi Vert, Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz and Travis Scott on the record. Lil Uzi Vert comes off as a Mini Migos clone on the single “Bad and Boujee.” Migos picked a subdued beat by Metro Boomin that resembles the sluggish, murky vibe pushed by 21 Savage on “Savage Mode.” However, they perform in an aggressive and dominant way on the track. Gucci appears on “Slippery” with his slouchy delivery and adds just enough of a different flow to prevent being mistaken as a Migos clone. His influence on Migos is extremely apparent on the track, since it is really hard to pinpoint the exact moment when Gucci’s verse ends and Takeoff’s verse begins. The track “Big on Big” is one of the few songs that feels focused on a single topic. Migos warns their haters, “How you gon’ big on big?” and are self aware of the fact that they are the biggest thing “popping” at the onset of 2017. It also has an enjoyable hook performed by Takeoff. It is one of the moments where the roles of the group are switched. A dynamic change like this adds new flavors to good moments on the album and keeps the album from feeling repetitive and bland.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe strings on “Big on Big” are also a welcome addition to the overall instrumentation of an album where bass hits consistently dominate. Migos takes the sound off Travis Scott’s Rodeo on the track “Kelly Price.” Down to the melodic passages crooned by Offset and Quavo, the song is obviously crafted and inspired by Travis Scott. The flows on this track do not feel like the typical, abrasive passages that Migos is known for. In fact, the second verse performed by Offset follows the similar sporadic flow organization found on “beibs in the trap” off of Scott’s sophomore record. However, these notions do not mean that the track is unenjoyable. The melodies in the verses convey feelings of lurking through dark alleys after a loud dance episode at a club. The drug references also give the song a very intoxicating and nauseating sensation. If there is anything about the track that gives away Scott’s influence, it is the reverb-drenched, synth-driven outro. The album as a whole appropriately fits the rest of Migos’ discography, and the trio continue their reign on the southern trap sound without pushing boundaries enough to lose any of their core fans. Overall I would give the album 6/10.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFavorite Tracks : “Bad and Boujee”, “Big on Big”, “All Ass”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWorst Track : “Deadz”\u003c/p\u003e",

When I had previously called the theater, the staff made it clear that there would be no late seatings. True to their word, within five minutes the doors were opened, and by 10:15 everyone had taken their seats and the show had begun. Although I had never been to an improv show, I had high expectations from the star-studded list of former cast members. \u003ci\u003eBackstage West\u003c/i\u003e, a magazine for working actors, once dubbed The Groundlings Theatre “the unofficial training ground for future players on \u003ci\u003eSaturday Night Live\u003c/i\u003e.” Sure enough, photos of the school’s famous alumni, including Jillian Bell, Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, and Will Ferrell, decorate the lobby.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"987\" data-orig-height=\"484\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/474920b55ba43bb5445bc7b0a930c1e9/tumblr_inline_ol6kzb66jR1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"987\" data-orig-height=\"484\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eMelissa McCarthy and Will Ferrell in The Groundlings.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The Groundlings Theatre met my high expectations. Every sketch was clever and well executed. The audience was in stitches from the first scene, about a new nail technician and his pushy girlfriend, to the last number of the night, about two background singers breaking out into a solo career. It occurred to me early on that one of the cast members looked remarkably familiar, so during the intermission, I googled his name and confirmed that I, in fact, did recognize the actor - Andrew Leeds, from his recurring role on \u003ci\u003eBones\u003c/i\u003e as Pelant. This discovery speaks to the theater’s ability to draw both up-and-coming as well as well-established actors to their stage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy favorite sketch of the night featured Mr. Leeds. This scene was a musical number that followed two sports writers as they tried to find a story to save their failing sports website. The tune was very catchy, and I can assure you that it was stuck in my head for the next three days after the show. If you asked me, I could probably perform half of the dance that went along with it too. My plus one for the night preferred a different musical sketch, which featured two intellectuals critiquing their daughter’s talent show choreography, culminating in an overtly sexual and outrageous dance routine to Hailee Steinfeld’s “Starving.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHalfway through the show, two of the cast members performed an improvised scene. An audience member was asked to read the last text message they received, which was to become the first line of the new sketch. The selected text message read, “I was planning something for after,” and the subsequent scene had a somewhat expected, suggestive theme, but it was funny nonetheless. Another standout sketch that featured audience participation commented on the ridiculous nature of fame. It opened with the entrance of two female cast members dressed in gaudy clothing who proclaimed that their job was to “seem famous.” According to them, Los Angeles is full of people like them who carry the air and appearance of being famous but are not actually famous. They then brought a rather reluctant audience member onstage with them and taught her how to “seem famous” as well, sharing tips about how to name-drop and casually mention that you’re filming a blockbuster. For me, the weak link of the night was a Liam Neeson sketch that fell short, but overall I found the show to be consistently entertaining.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’d be remiss if I didn’t take a moment to complement the live band that played during set changes. The trio did an excellent job of maintaining the audience’s energy by playing segments from a variety of classic songs, from artists such as the Rolling Stones to newer songs by Daft Punk and Arcade Fire. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009After the show, the cast members came out into the lobby and mingled with the audience members. I was very surprised to see this since it is very unusual for the staff of professional companies to interact with the public post-performance. However, I was glad that The Groundlings Theatre did this because it gave me an opportunity to talk to Andrew Leeds and tell him how I thought he was excellent in \u003ci\u003eBones\u003c/i\u003e, like a total noob.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a whole, The Groundlings put on a good show, and I’d recommend that everyone take the chance to see them on a Friday night while you’re going to UCLA. As a word of advice, the earlier you show up, the better your seat will be, and if you are hoping to participate, try to sit near the aisle where you’ll be easier to reach. No matter where you end up, though, I guarantee you’ll enjoy The Groundlings Theatre’s witty comedy and silly sketches.\u003c/p\u003e",

Whether this serves to be a reflection of her own life or the generalization of the population as a whole, she reveals an expression of the concept of finding love in this lonely world. Remaining within her typical lyrical range about desire, drugs and sex, she invites her fans to join her on an emotional rollercoaster.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis time around, Tove Lo’s motifs are told in a story that is divided into two main chapters, \u0026lsquo;Fairy Dust\u0026rsquo; and 'Fire Fade.\u0026rsquo; The cheeky title ‘Lady Wood\u0026rsquo; terms the concept of a woman getting a hard on. However, and perhaps more importantly, it serves as a declaration of female sexual expression.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHer first song — a mix of woozy, slippery tunes — is “Cool Girl”,  an ode to the Gone Girl character Amy Dunne. The first chapter explores the initial high of a relationship with the glossy songs of \u0026ldquo;Influence\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Lady Wood\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;True Disaster.\u0026rdquo; Here, Tove Lo focuses on the concept of perfection, as well as her attempts to stay locked in the narrative of illusion versus reality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the latter half of the album, Tove Lo displays the comedown, and how drips of reality start seeping back into her cloud of vision. With the feverish numbers \u0026ldquo;Keep it Simple\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t Talk About it\u0026rdquo;, Tove Lo highlights the unspoken feelings and the darkest moments of distance and separation. She ends things off with \u0026ldquo;WTF Is Love\u0026rdquo;, an upbeat track that questions why she even decided to partake in this emotional train wreck. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, this album is quite successful and stamped with the signature of Tove Lo. Regardless of whether or not you are a fan of electronic or pop music, her music will catch you off guard and will slowly find its way into your top favorites. I\u0026rsquo;d definitely recommend checking out, it’s a solid 8/10!\u003c/p\u003e",

He explains, “All my experiences, in and out of the classroom, really\npush me to expand my perspective. It’s less thinking of things as separate\nworlds but as possible inspiration. To me, that forms an interesting output\nbecause I am getting so many different sources of input from so many areas. I\ndo that by having a lot of different hobbies and doing a lot of different\nthings because it helps get to know human nature.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith this in mind, Heramb recently\njoined all of his experiences together to self-produce his debut album\n(available on Spotify, Soundcloud, and iTunes) under the title “Red.” The album serves perfectly as a soundtrack for a beach side bonfire - a\ncombination of soothing acoustic artistry paired with wave-y, heartfelt ballads\nmimicking the likes of The Kooks, Beach Boys, and Unknown Mortal Orchestra. As\nartists these days seem to stray from record deals and studio equipment, Heramb\nexplains that his limited resources and decision to singlehandedly produce his\nalbum actually aided in accurately depicting what he wanted his album to\nportray—emotionality. He states that his music represents “an authentic\nrepresentation of [his] emotions.” He continues, “I use music as another\nlanguage, a universal language, of where words fall short in expressing what it\nmeans to be human.” With his album representing the color red, which is often\nassociated with anger and other intense emotions, the rawness of the album\nshines through with the idea of externalized “redness.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a biology student, Heramb uses his\nlarge reach across campus in a way that helps him expand his creativity and in\nturn help other people relate to his music in personal ways. With his sphere of\ninfluence spanning in all types of areas at UCLA, Heramb’s music is easily accessible for\npeople of all backgrounds. He states, “Having a lot of different hobbies and\ndoing a lot of different things helps me get a larger perspective. It allows me\nto stay level headed and makes my music more accessible to other people because\nif I were just singing about certain things, cells for example, no one would be\ninterested in it other than a specific group of people who like songs about\ncells.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough the singer-songwriter realm\nis hyper-saturated with musicians wearing their hearts on their sleeves, Heramb\nsticks to his guns instead of comparing himself to others. “There’s that old saying ‘Comparison\nis the thief of joy’ and I think it’s easy to fall into looking at what everyone\nelse does. I’m more so trying to limit my thoughts about following what is\npopular and instead focusing on reeling my emotions rather than what I feel\nlike my emotions \u003ci\u003eshould \u003c/i\u003ebe,” he says. In a homogenous world where individuality seems impossible, combating the beast of\nconforming is not really about creating an entirely new sound, entirely new\ninstruments, or even a unique worldview. Instead, the way that something is\noriginal is that the art is coming uniquely from its creator, that no one has\nheard this individual story specifically. Since everyone has such similar\nexperiences, you just have to create in a way that is coming from your\nupbringing and your emotions. Heramb successfully does so by putting his soul\non the line—open for all to see.\u003c/p\u003e",

The concert opened up with Kweku Collins. I admit I had never heard of him before that night, but the amount of energy he had on stage was pretty amazing. His DJ hyped the crowd while he rapped a few songs to start warming up. Pell came on right after, and I have to say he has earned a new fan. Being able see Pell rap up close on stage was incredible. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2048\" data-orig-height=\"1365\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/842a49e8ab8c6dfa7f1b660be41456a6/tumblr_inline_oibb48kCiR1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2048\" data-orig-height=\"1365\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eFollowing Pell was the man of the hour, Tory Lanez. I was able to get a sneak peek at his set list before he performed and I was excited because he performed a lot of my favorites. I’ve seen rappers get crazy on stage before but Tory is an experience in itself - as he jumps into the audience, rather than crowd surfing, he stands on the audience. As people hold his hands and legs up to balance him, he stands in the middle of the crowd rapping one of his biggest hits, \u0026ldquo;Diego\u0026rdquo;. Between songs he also performed some fun old school songs. Tory is a man of many talents, as he has an incredible singing voice to go along with his ability to rap. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2048\" data-orig-height=\"1365\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/50e94b94ac3827ed6586179991542540/tumblr_inline_oibb45dEj31qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2048\" data-orig-height=\"1365\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2048\" data-orig-height=\"1365\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/db95a1248bc81988c7dfc21bbd050b66/tumblr_inline_oibb4aF65o1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2048\" data-orig-height=\"1365\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was a lot of fun watching these three artists on stage present their work, and it was a lot more fun because of the location - the Echoplex is a fairly small venue and so the crowd becomes part of the performance, rather than just bystanders. \u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By: Nicole Jewell \u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date: \u0026frac34;/17\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the name “Ashton Kutcher,” is thrown around, you usually think of him as ‘that guy in that movie’, or ‘the man who managed to marry Mila Kunis.’ However, Kutcher has actually been dedicating his time to what he refers to as his “day-job,” a non-profit organization called Thorn. There has been recent attention to this organization, due to Kutcher’s appearance before and appeal to Congress about “the right to pursue happiness” (CNN). Kutcher went to defend his efforts against child human trafficking, asking for more funding to fuel technology. Funding which would go towards, specifically, the software used to locate victims of child human trafficking, as well as several other resources for victims. Some of those include building a better “foster care system” and “mental health system” to assist victims once they are saved. Kutcher spoke passionately, evoking emotion as he recalled specific FBI raids that he had witnessed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis co-founded organization uses software tools called “Spotlight” and “Solis,” both of which employ tools that have decreases “investigation time by 60%.” Solis investigates “dark web material,” the dark web being an “encrypted network” that is used to be unconventional search engines, in this case pornographic material of minors (quora.com). It was through this software that Kutcher saw “video content of a child that\u0026rsquo;s the same age as mine being raped by an American man that was a sex tourist in Cambodia. And this child was so conditioned by her environment that she thought she was engaging in play.” It is because of this, and his natural fatherly love and instincts, that drives Kutcher to so passionately present his cause to Congress. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe site for Thorn is informative, highlighting the issue of trafficking via the internet, in how it “makes content and abuse easier to identify and participate in; like-minded individuals can create communities to justify their actions; digital imagery and videos allow abuse to be shared globally at the push of a button; and private and encrypted networks protect individuals that participate in the most egregious types of abuse” (Thorn.com). The site additionally defines terms such as “DMST, live-streaming sexual abuse, sextortion, [and] child sexual abuse imagery,” leaving the web visitor more informed and aware of the modern tools used to perpetuate sex trafficking. It is astounding to consider that children as young as one year old are subject to this (arkofhopeforchildren.org), let alone that this happens in the United States.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIssues such as child human trafficking cannot be overlooked in the United States, as it serves as a large perpetrator. Yes, it “serves” child human trafficking because it still exists - children from overseas are still being abducted and forced into sexual abuse - and American citizens pay and take pleasure in this. While it is an uncomfortable truth to process, trafficking will remain an issue until it is openly discussed and eliminated. Actions taken by important figures in society, such as Ashton Kutcher, are crucial due to their influence. After reading this article, you should learn what Thorn is for yourself, and how this program accomplishes what it does — and how you can become involved. Simply reading and reporting about this issue is not enough.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By: Aaron Peretz\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date: 2/22/17\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the second Thursday of February, the Giegling collective held a concert to preface their LA party, one stop on their world tour. Two days later, on the fringe of downtown LA, an undisclosed location housed these laconic immigrants. From late afternoon until early morning on Sunday, the line-up—including ATEQ, DJ Dustin, Edward, Kettenkarussell (Konstantin and Leafar Legov), and Vril—rocked the warehouse with somber sounds of intercepted phonemes against wandering bass lines.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe day long nature of the event invited flux. The sun ebbed and crowds flowed. The reclined indifference of the afternoon sobered up with the onset of nighttime. This very process of building is intrinsic to Giegling’s minimal tech house sound, so that patient listeners are those most rewarded. In fact, “patient” may be incorrect. Having fun has no goal, and patience expects an end. Rather it was those people without agenda that could appreciate immediacy: knowing where you stand without expectation as to where you go. Whether or not the design was an intelligent one, the party’s timeline effectively told partiers to live immediately. Time elapsed to no one’s beat. Without legislated feeling, it was this untamed will to live that I sensed as the unofficial attitude of Giegling noise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a (sympathetic) person, I naturally feel bad for anyone unable to participate in this willing. Some loiter in the crowds, invested in all black wear, adhering to the unspoken rules of the game. However, immediacy warps rules, each set preserved in a moment. One individual resembles any other, but need only adhere to her own rules. Still, some ideologically weak immune systems are ruled by impulse to impose their rules on others. Insecure in their identity, they undermine themselves by being the only outdated rules they’re familiar with. This insecurity is never satiated till the world caves to its own stagnancy. Black shirts and subdued voices are not concomitant with fascism, it is merely the fascist bound to myopic principles with glasses fogged by fury that groups them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, LA feels. Here, we feel the international threat to decency and to the celebration of life. We work to stay true to the outstanding will of dance, its exponents like Giegling, and its desire to contact and appreciate, not to conquer. The party was successful in its ability to inspire my sense of gratitude and make contact with a place far away through a sound near ’n’ dear. Giegling prompted LA to gather around \u003ci\u003eAusländer\u003c/i\u003e, its tour dusting dogma, and the connection of the universal. Los Angeles found herself reinvigorated in a responsibility to stay diverse and let the beat build.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By: Elizabeth Hsieh \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date: 2/16/17\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCurrently studying at UCLA as a foreign exchange student from New Zealand, Vera Williams of Maple Syrup was quick to plunge herself into LA’s music scene by creating two new bands and playing constant house shows throughout California. For those who have not yet heard of Maple Syrup, their sound embodies that new wave of gritty, melodic punk combined with the sound of dirty guitars and momentous bass lines. Even as she is separated from the band back home, she continues to make moves in her musical career, with her band just recently releasing a music video for their single “Maybe Someday (I’ll Have a Friend)”. Check it out below.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DUrikQKIR_Ak\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UrikQKIR_Ak?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWho is Vera? Who is Maple Syrup?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy name is Vera. I am currently a student at UCLA and I am from Wellington, New Zealand. Maple Syrup began about 4 years ago in Wellington, with myself and Jerry Ramirez making absurd folk mix tapes. We eventually got our friend from High School, Tarquin Smith, on drums and Lukas Jury on bass, and developed a much heavier sound. Since then, we’ve played shows all around New Zealand, released an EP and have recorded a soon-to-be-released record, which this single is off of.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat was the inspiration behind the video?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI remember I got the idea in the middle of the night. That’s usually when I get my best ideas. I’ve always liked one shot videos with minimal editing. Its fascinating to watch action play out sort of live in front of you, like in Radiohead’s “No Surprises” video! Our band is very much about the coming together of the sublime and the ridiculous — and I think the video is inspired by that concept.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow was the creative process of making the video? Were there any difficulties?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe spent the day after Christmas rehearsing the video from start to finish with all of the cues - from the lighting, to when each object would be thrown on me - until we had it perfect. That got pretty tedious because of how messy I ended up getting, and we had limited resources (e.g. one pack of cigarettes) and only one shot to get it perfect. Our plan was to just roll with it if something went wrong, but luckily nothing did. When I beat up Jerry at the end of the video, what you can’t see is that he is lying in a pile of squashed cigarettes mixed with maple syrup and water. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThere are weird objects being thrown at you during the video. How did you decide on what objects to include?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach one had a different reason. Some were chosen in direct reference to the lyrics (e.g. the cigarettes and the paint brush). Others were chosen purely for visual effect (e.g. the toilet paper, the egg on the head, the bucket of water). Then of course there is the Maple Syrup reference with the pancakes! Each object also has its own symbolic purpose as well, I suppose.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eYour character undergoes quite a drastic change in attitude during the video. Can you talk about some of the symbolism behind that?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy interpretation is that it’s about someone who is going through life passively, not letting anything affect her. In the song that’s expressed by the passive way I sing harsh lyrics, and in the video by my lack of a reaction to having various objects thrown at me. When I’m pushed over the edge, I finally expresses myself and assert my power by getting revenge. I’m sure everyone will read the video differently, though. There is no correct interpretation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSo would you say there is a feminist angle to the video?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eDefinitely. I think that, as women, we are expected to deal with a lot and be able to just get on with it and not burden others with our feelings. Our ability to do that so well is a testimony to how strong we really are. At the same time, it’s important to liberate yourself from those expectations and express who you are and how you feel. I think my character is pretty chuffed with herself once she does.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow can we stay tuned for more info about the upcoming album?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe already have two singles out which you can listen/download free on b\u003ca href=\"http://maypalsyrup.bandcamp.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eandcamp\u003c/a\u003e.

Steve Jobs was the richest dude in the fucking world and created hella shit and on his deathbed he was still like, \u0026lsquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t take none of that shit with me.\u0026rsquo; You get robbed one day for everything you fucking own and what are you left with? You better hope that you was a good person. Because they can\u0026rsquo;t take that away from you.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough \u003ci\u003eSweetSexySavage\u003c/i\u003e is Kehlani’s first album produced with a major recording label, it would be a mistake to view the LP as a general “get to know the artist” introduction. Kehlani has previously released two mixtapes, \u003ci\u003eCloud 19 \u003c/i\u003eand \u003ci\u003eYou Should Be Here\u003c/i\u003e, and because of this \u003ci\u003eSweetSexySavage\u003c/i\u003e simply feels like the next chapter in a familiar autobiography. And if you have not been keeping up with that autobiography, you better start now. As she says herself in “Too Much,” Kehlani is “too much of a woman / too much of a bad ass bitch / too much of a boss,” and she is not waiting around for anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSimilar to Kanye West’s \u003ci\u003eCollege Dropout\u003c/i\u003e trilogy, Kehlani’s albums chronicle her rise from an ambitious nobody to a powerful, influential player in the music industry. \u003ci\u003eSweetSexySavage \u003c/i\u003eemerges as the final destination Kehlani has been working for, her arrival into a life that in older mixtapes she had only been dreaming about. And Kehlani’s fiercely unapologetic attitude indicates that now that she has arrived, she intends to stay. Again and again throughout the LP Kehlani makes clear that she is a confident artist who refuses to be belittled or manipulated. This self-assuredness is reinforced with her music’s bubbly and energetic sound. Kehlani’s punchy cheerfulness in songs like “Piece of Mind” or “Too Much” reminds Kehlani’s haters that she does not need them, she is thriving without them, and her absence from their lives is their loss. This giddy independence also translates to Kehlani’s approach to dating, where with the exception of a few smitten ballads like “In My Feelings” and “Hold Me By The Heart,” she insists that if her partner is not going to treat her right, then that is his or her loss because she is “not like other bitches” (“Do U Dirty”). However, Kehlani’s self-assertiveness ought not to be confused with arrogance. The penultimate song of this album, “Thank You,” humbly expresses appreciation for her supporters, and promises Kehlani’s dedication to improving herself and her art.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of Kehlani’s greatest artistic strengths is her ability to take her diary-entry style of storytelling and distill it into a catchy pop R\u0026amp;B sound without sacrificing any of her genuineness. For example, the song “Not Used To It” reveals Kehlani’s fear of trusting others, wherein she realizes that she has never known a good man, either in her own relationships or when she was growing up in a family full of single mothers. But surprisingly, Kehlani delivers this confession using a fast-paced, happy-sounding melody. “Not Used To it” is a song that could be played in a club, but its smooth, bright sound does not dilute the authenticity of her lyrics. Instead, the song, as well as the rest of \u003ci\u003eSweetSexySavage\u003c/i\u003e, is a testament to Kehlani’s versatility as both a chart-topping star and a down to earth girl who does not sugarcoat her vulnerabilities for the sake of producing hits.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFavorite tracks of the album: “Do U Dirty,” “Personal,” and “Keep On”\u003c/p\u003e",

If you are an Angels, Athletics, Dodgers, Padres, or Giants fan, you might want to pay attention.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBelow is an excerpt from Grow’s \u003ca href=\"http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/how-mike-%20%20trout-could-%20legally-become-%20a-free-%20agent\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epiece\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eA relatively obscure provision under California law — specifically, Section 2855 of the California Labor Code — limits all personal services contracts (i.e., employment contracts) in the state to a maximum length of seven years. In other words, this means that if an individual were to sign an employment contract in California lasting eight or more years, then at the conclusion of the seventh year the employee would be free to choose to either continue to honor the agreement, or else opt out and seek employment elsewhere.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eAlthough the California legislature has previously considered eliminating this protection for certain professional athletes – including Major League Baseball players – no such amendment has passed to date. Consequently, Section 2855 would presumptively apply to any player employed by one of the five major-league teams residing in California. \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis provision, although never used and rarely known by both players and their agents, would allow for players who have been under contract for a baseball franchise in the state of California for seven years or longer to immediately terminate their contracts, or activate an immediate opt-out clause. Even if the player has since signed an extension or a new contract that differs from their original one with the team, they are still eligible for the opt-out. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith that said, we will be looking at nine players that play for California baseball franchises, and who are either already eligible for the opt-out, or who will become so this summer. To calculate the players per season value if they were to hit the free agent market, we will be using the following factors:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1. The estimate made by Neil Paine of \u003ca href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efivethirtyeight.com\u003c/a\u003e that teams were willing to pay $7.7 million per WAR following the 2015 season.

After finding each player’s market value based on WAR, we will compare the number to their actual or projected 2017 salaries. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eFormula: 2016 WAR x $7.7 million = Market Value Salary\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e1.

Driving to an afternoon show, I\nnoticed how close it is to so many iconic Angeleno art institutions, like the\nBroad, the MOCA, and the LA Opera.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI pulled up\nto the shiny metallic architecture. Cutting it close to the start of the show,\nI rushed to will call, entered the lobby, zoomed up the stairs and entered the\ninside of the hall.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvery time I\nenter the hall, it’s such a wow moment. The exterior of the hall is bold and\nfuturistic, while the interior is grand and warm. I sat in my seat and observed\nthe intense wooden beams that stretched out of the organ at the back of the\norchestra. Not too much later, the lights dimmed, creating a vignette effect on\nthe orchestra. \u003ca href=\"http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/krzysztof-urbanski\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKrzysztof Urbański\u003c/a\u003e, the\nconductor for the performance, walked to\nthe podium.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/krzysztof-urbanski\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eUrbański\u003c/a\u003e\n\n is\na young conductor in his early 30s. Within his short career the Polish\nconductor and composer has conducted all over the globe, from Hamburg and Norway\nto Indiana and Toronto, and has received countless prestigious awards.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e With a lift\nof his hands, Beethoven’s \u003ci\u003eLeonore Overture No. 3 \u003c/i\u003ebegan. It was a very majestic\npiece. The builds and drops of the strings and winds in contrast to the brass\ncreated a balanced tension. \n\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/krzysztof-urbanski\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eUrbański\u003c/a\u003e had a strong dynamic with the\norchestra. His effortless conducting and smiles throughout the piece showed\nhow much fun he was having. Then, there was the trumpet solo!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI love the\nWDCH for the visual absence of soloists. A couple years ago, when the LA Phil\nplayed “Neptune,” from Holst\u0026rsquo;s T\u003ci\u003ehe Planets \u003c/i\u003esuite, I remember hearing a choir, but\nnot seeing it. Being in the nose bleed seats at the time, I noticed everyone else\ntrying to track down where the voices came from in the giant hall. And as soon as I\nheard the trumpet, I inspected the crowd and found a similar trend. As the trumpet\nsolo faded in and out and each time it played, I observed a wave of\nheads turning as they tried to pinpoint the location of the soloist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e Next, was\nMozart’s \u003ci\u003eViolin Concerto No.5\u003c/i\u003e. This piece featured German-Italian\nsoloist Augustin Hadelich. In the pre-concert talks, which take place usually an hour before\nthe show (10/10 recommendation), Hadelich and host Thomas Neesan talked about his\nJuilliard education, recent Grammy, and soloist career that has taken him\nacross the globe at such an early age. Acclaimed as one of the greatest\nviolinists of his generation, his solo in the \u003ci\u003eViolin Concerto No.5 \u003c/i\u003edefinitely\nvalidated his title.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlaying an instrument with sheet music is difficult, but playing a whole Mozart piece\nfrom memory while standing in front of an enormous audience is harder.\nNevertheless, Hadelich delicately and deliberately felt and played each note in\nthe concerto. From the application of the precise pressure on his bow to the\nreaction of the music shown through his facial and body movements, Hadelich enchanted the audience with his performance. The chemistry between \n\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/krzysztof-urbanski\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eUrbański\u003c/a\u003e\n\n\nand Hadelich was also amazing. It was like twin telepathy with their subtle eye contact, not only for cues, but for encouragement that was so\norganic and caring. At the conclusion of his performance, Hadelich received a\nlong standing ovation which was followed by an encore solo, which also got\nanother standing ovation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e After\nintermission, the brass and wind reconvened for the last piece, \u003ci\u003eBrahms\u0026rsquo;s\nSymphony No.2.\u003c/i\u003e  \u003ci\u003eSymphony No.2\u003c/i\u003e was a\ngentler piece in comparison to Beethoven, but was equally as captivating. The\nsong seemed like the making of an intricate silk coat. The layering and\nreceding of each instrument was interlocking. \n\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.laphil.com/philpedia/krzysztof-urbanski\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eUrbański\u003c/a\u003e\n\nweaved the orchestra\ntogether through his gentle conducting in the pastoral moments, as well as his\nanimated conducting in the sporadic builds. At the conclusion of \u003ci\u003eSymphony No.2\u003c/i\u003e,\nthe concert concluded with rounds of applause for all the performers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn afternoon\nof Mozart and Brahms with the LA Philharmonic, Urbański, and Hadelich\nwas spectacular. From the\ngracious music conducted and played to the rituals of the orchestra\nperformance, the LA\nPhilharmonic\u0026rsquo;s performance at the WDCH is probably the most essential\nexperience for an appreciator of the arts.\u003c/p\u003e",

While there is much sadness in the loss of such an iconic figure, it is impossible to look back on Sager’s life and career and not feel a deep sense of gratitude for his unwavering courage in the face of true hardship, his vibrant personality, and his refusal to compromise on those things which make life worth living.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the days since his passing, hundreds of Sager’s colleagues and fans have come out to offer their condolences to his family and share their fondest memories of the man and how he affected the lives of everyone he met. These \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/8WnTOV5efjw\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evideos\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.latimes.com/sports/nba/la-sp-craig-sager-nba-tributes-20161216-htmlstory.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003earticles\u003c/a\u003e are out there and I highly recommend you check them out, as well as his speech at the ESPY Awards earlier this year where he was \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01BMPwDUO74\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epresented the Jimmy V Award for Perseverance by Vice President Joe Biden.\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile I echo all of the sentiments expressed above, this is not one of those pieces. I’m not writing this to talk about the death of a giant in the world of sports broadcasting. The reason I’m writing this piece is because I feel a deep connection to Mr. Sager. I am also writing this because, in a year when we have lost so many, Sager’s death has affected me deeply in ways I have yet to fully process. I am still trying to understand how his death, and more importantly his legacy, will impact how I will live the rest of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCraig Sager was a shining example of positivity in the face of adversity. He demonstrated that you can live your life with joy no matter what circumstances you may face. Most people who know me know that I am a Golden State Warriors fan. What not all of them may know is that this fandom came on very suddenly just last year, out of the most unexpected of circumstances. Last September, just weeks before I was to begin my senior year at UCLA, I was diagnosed with Stage III Mediastinal B-Cell Lymphoma. In less than a week, my life went from going to concerts with friends and stressing over the prospect of writing my senior thesis to a seemingly endless barrage of scans, biopsies, and hospital beds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m not going to lie and say I knew about Sager growing up, or even that he was influential for me going into my treatment. I only started watching basketball after I was diagnosed and found myself with lots of extra time and empty nights, looking for a sense of purpose and identity when it seemed like all others had been taken away from me. I was no longer a student or a friend or a musician - I was just a cancer patient. That was, except for a couple of nights a week, when I was a Warriors fan. Being a fan of the Warriors meant that, even if it was just for some precious hours out of the week, I was on the winning team.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the things that first drew me to the Warriors (what has made me such an ardent GIF-sharing, monogrammed-backpack-carrying, superstitious-lucky-cap-wearing fan) was the sense of joy with which they played every night. It was clear that they loved what they were doing, and even when the stakes were high, they would never sacrifice the fun and love of the game. As someone who has chosen to live my life pursuing my passion, this resonated with me deeply. Whatever joy the Warriors expressed on the court, Sager exemplified the same joy on the sidelines, not just in his unapologetically flamboyant and at times outrageous outfits and amiable demeanor, but in the thoughtfulness and directness of his questions and the high standard to which he held his work every night.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can never know how you will respond to something like cancer until you’re faced with it directly. I never imagined it could happen to me and I certainly could not have predicted that if it did, I would face it with positivity and use it as an opportunity to become a stronger person. Don’t get me wrong, cancer is absolutely horrible. Chemotherapy is a long and unrelenting uphill battle designed to push your body to its absolute limits. I don’t need to go into all of that. While I was hooked up to machines in the hospital bed during one of many five-day stays to receive my chemotherapy, I knew my circumstances were unusual and objectively awful. I knew that regardless of how I felt on a given day, I was always sick. If I ever happened to forget, I had visitors coming in everyday telling me how terrible my situation was and how it was so unfair that I had to endure this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYet, as I sat in my bed and looked around at the family and friends by my side, and the doctors and nurses who worked tirelessly to get me well, I felt like the luckiest person in the world. Yes, I was very ill and hundreds of miles away from the friends and school I loved so dearly, but I knew all of that would still be waiting for me when I was healthy enough to go back. My fingers had gone numb as a side-effect of my chemotherapy which made playing guitar and bass quite difficult, but every time I picked up my instrument, I felt a fire inside of me that pushed me to play harder everyday. People would ask me how my treatment was going and I almost had to bite my tongue because I felt like I was doing nothing but brag about the excellent care I was receiving.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can also never know the ways in which cancer will try to break you until you experience it firsthand. It doesn’t care if you’re young or old, rich or poor, religious or atheist. It will take from you everything it can, and in the face of that battle there is no “correct” way to cope with cancer. How you process and face your illness is as unique to the individual as your treatment plan. Whether you choose to greet the day with gratitude or with anger, everyone’s emotions are valid. When I woke up in the morning and saw before me an opportunity to seize the day and show this disease that it would not dictate how I lived my life, it wasn’t because I thought it would help me get better faster or make me less of a burden on those around me. It was simply how I saw the world. Prior to cancer, I was already aggressively optimistic and always tried to look on the bright side, not for any superficial reason, but simply because it was there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCraig Sager was validation that I didn’t have to view cancer as a negative - that sickness didn’t have to become my identity, and that if you live life with love and passion as your core, you can overcome anything. While my age and prognosis clearly differ greatly from Mr. Sager’s, I know there is always pressure to give in and succumb to the weight and the gravity, especially when it feels like your disease is always three steps ahead and you’re struggling just to hold down a meal. I am in constant awe of the lengths to which he went to seek every experimental treatment that offered a chance at extending his life, all while continuing to work and travel to cover games, sometimes just hours after receiving chemotherapy. It’s no small feat to not only refuse to let your illness hinder your spirit and ability to pursue your passion, but also to use it as fuel to push you to chase after it like never before, whether or not optimism is your default state of mind.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you decide to live your life following your passion, it is a choice you make every single day and a mentality that drives everything else you do in life. For Sager, letting cancer keep him from working was never an option. Taking time away from the NBA to receive treatments that required him to be in total isolation, as some doctors had suggested, would have meant that the cancer had won. No matter what the disease threw at him, he was adamant that a life in which he could not do the job he loved most was not a life worth living.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrior to the start of the Golden State Warriors game against the New York Knicks in Oakland Thursday night, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr, who was a colleague of Sager’s at TNT prior to taking the coaching job at Golden State, spoke of Sager’s “zest for life,” and said that rather than have a moment of silence, “given the way Craig lived his life and the joy that he brought to so many people, [it would be more appropriate] to have a moment of joy instead.” The entire Oracle Arena agreed and responded with fervent applause and cheers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is easy to boil down Sager’s legacy to his elaborate suits or his \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltpqPd3t5V0\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ememorable conversations with Kevin Garnett\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psUA7aGBQio\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSan Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich.\u003c/a\u003e But as a survivor, I will view Mr. Sager’s true legacy as his ongoing commitment to his job, his family and friends, and always being himself and expressing his true colors, even when the vibrancy of those colors may raise some eyebrows.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile Craig Sager’s battle with leukemia may be over, he did not lose the battle. He lived his life with courage, grace and optimism right through his final days. The fire of his spirit, kept alive for so many years by his compassionate soul and fierce tenacity, could not be doused by cancer. It still burns deep in the hearts of all who knew him and were inspired by his unrelenting determination to, as he said so eloquently in his ESPY Awards speech, “sucking the marrow out of life as life sucks the marrow out of me.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe may have lost Craig Sager, but cancer did not win.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Show Review // Jay Som @ The Echo (12/3/16)",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By: Amy Cummings, UCLA Radio Intern\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date: 12/11/16\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJay Som played to a small but appreciative crowd of fans at their Los Angeles \u003ci\u003eTurn Into \u003c/i\u003ephysical release party at the Echo. The band and their fans came together in the intimate setting of the Echo for an early show to celebrate, creating a friendly atmosphere as if we were all friends out to support each other at a house show. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile waiting for Jay Som’s set I befriended Neil, who was working the merch table, and he showed us the full array of physical albums. The physical release of \u003ci\u003eTurn Into\u003c/i\u003e was confirmed as something to celebrate as I eyed the pressings on gorgeous white and green marbled vinyl, pink cassette tapes, and CDs. Neil offered to throw in a copy of the album if I bought the ‘$3,000 Bratz mixtape’ that was inexplicably also displayed. Like many artists who play the Echo, Melina Duterte and the rest of the band hung out in the audience to watch supporting acts Plush and Los Angeles Police Department before taking the stage to set up their own equipment. Duterte, the multi-talented face of Jay Som, plugged in cords as a fan asked her, “What’s your sign?” The drummer handed out minty chewing gum to fans at the front of the stage and shortly afterward, they started with the title track.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eConsidering the purpose of the evening was conceivably to promote the \u003ci\u003eTurn Into\u003c/i\u003e physical release, the band focused on appreciating their fans and just having fun with their music, despite a solemn nod to the tragic events of the previous night’s warehouse fire in Oakland that deeply affected the artist community where Jay Som is based. Though already well-known on Oakland’s music scene, Jay Som’s popularity is growing, boosted by their national tour this year opening for Japanese Breakfast and Mitski. The tour also visited the Echoplex in July, surely resulting in a crop of new fans from around Los Angeles. But the band certainly doesn’t feel like an opener. Jay Som appears on stage as a drummer and three guitars, with vocals provided by Duterte. They are confident performers, with a rock sound but a relaxed attitude that makes Turn Into a solid listen, and no doubt helped them amass the dedicated fans that turned out to watch them headline for their release party. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJay Som jammed through most of the songs on Turn Into, including a playful extended ending of “Next to Me,” that Duterte said she had agreed to do after losing a bet. The live performance didn’t disappoint, and the band and audience alike seemed to be having a great time. To finish, Jay Som brought up the Plush to sing on an excellent cover of “Maps,” by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and then invited up the audience for an impassioned rendition of Weezer’s “Undone - The Sweater Song.” A few enthusiastic audience members climbed onto the stage to provide all the in-song banter and rocked out to the lyrics with Duterte. For their musical professionalism, it’s obvious that Jay Som knows how to have fun.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\nAfter the set ended, I snagged the set list “for my notes,” bought a pink tape, and borrowed a Sharpie from my new friend Neil. Duterte was hanging out chatting with fans and graciously signed merch for a few of us. I told her I really connected with what she had said about riding the bus during her show with Mitski. Later, we caught up with a couple other students riding the 2 back to UCLA and discussed how much we all liked the show (and commiserated about the bus.) Jay Som has a bright future ahead and I’ll be looking forward to the next LA appearance.\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://jaysom.bandcamp.com/album/turn-into\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCheck out \u003ci\u003eTurn Into \u003c/i\u003ehere.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Jimmy Bazzy is the host of the almighty internet music show “Fantasy Archive” on UCLA Radio. This month, UCLA Radio has chosen the show as its “Show of the Month” for not only spreading memes and flourescent color gradient charms webwide, but knowing how to. “Fantasy Archive” showcases only the deepest cuts in the (no love) deep web and goes beyond the world we know as “C++” (or “Earth” for short) to make it all happen. From today’s prominent electronic music such as that from label/collective PC Music to old, underrated SNES video game tunes, Jimmy sure knows how to provide a mean internet-centric type music playlist each week. It really goes to show how much a music genre thrives off a certain aesthetic to truly understand and what a better way to get educated than by tuning into Jimmy’s show.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWant a little background of Fantasy Archive’s aesthetic and learn a little more about Jimmy?

An amalgamation of Jewish organizations in Los Angeles and Tel Aviv collaborated to host this evening with first-hand stories from his loved ones and moving musical arrangements by acclaimed composer Sharon Farber.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe grandeur of the Saban Theater peacefully set the tone for an evening of accolades in remembrance of Prime Minister Rabin. Rabin’s progressive global perspective can perhaps be attributed to his valiant past. Rabin rose to become Chief of Operations during Israel’s War of Independence and in 1948, began a 27-year run as a soldier in the Israel Defense Forces. In 1974, Rabin was appointed Prime Minister – a period in which he thrived through the raid on Entebbe and the signing of the Sinai Interim Agreement. Throughout the 1980s, Rabin served as Israel’s Minister of Defense until resuming his duties as Prime Minister in 1992. During his second term, Rabin prioritized a peaceful resolution between Israel and Palestine, including signing several agreements in the Oslo Accords. His efforts were recognized in 1994, when Rabin won the Nobel Peace Prize with Shimon Peres and Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat. On 4 November 1995, Prime Minister Rabin was assassinated while leaving a peace rally in Tel Aviv’s central square, engraining his legacy of peace and progress in the hearts of Israelites.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2000\" data-orig-height=\"1333\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bf11f675beee83b0614d85f18413d96b/tumblr_inline_ny1b3w9xvE1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2000\" data-orig-height=\"1333\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eGeneral Photo\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe admiration in the audience was palpable, as various guests from around the world made their way to the podium to share stories of Rabin’s life. Shir Lashalom, from the Temple of the Arts, opened the event in speaking on how Rabin exemplified the strength that is Israel and strived for peace: \u0026ldquo;God will give you strength and then will give you peace.” As an outsider to this community, this gathering of Israelites, relishing in their culture, pays testament to the valiant effort the Jewish community in LA upholds towards preserving their culture in the modern day. The importance of words and languages was warmly felt. Rabbi David Baron’s national pride was echoed with applause when he held that there is no time like the present to visit Israel, regardless of its present dangers. David Siegel from the Israeli Consulate recounted hearing the news of Rabin’s death while he was serving as an Israeli diplomat in a small country in the horn of Africa: \u0026quot;It was like the patriarch of my own family was shot. The bullets were fired not only at this man… But at the core values of our existence.\u0026rdquo; A great friend of Rabin, singer Pat Boone, named Rabin a “great soldier who did not die in battle, but in his quest for peace,” as he told his story of cheering up soldiers in a bunker one day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1333\" data-orig-height=\"2000\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2d6d83e4afb864ca7616969031cd7440/tumblr_inline_ny1b6lJz3l1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1333\" data-orig-height=\"2000\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eConsul General David Siegel\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnity means respect for one another, even when we are at odds in opinion.

So in this review, I will attempt to avoid spoilers for all four films to the best of my ability, but bear with me as it is not easy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eSpectre\u003c/i\u003e is a hollow film, as if the tropes of a James Bond movie became the basis for a perfume commercial. The audience is given beautiful people in expensive, often monochromatic settings, grimacing at one other with the occasional quippy line lacking the smirk to sell it. Every character is seemingly devoid of passion regardless of the situation, and the situation is never really clearly explained to the audience. There is a sense that James is very driven to find out more about the eponymous organization but he never discusses why, and even when his connection to said organization is revealed, not a single character in the film seems shocked. I am not kidding; the lack of emotional payoff made me question whether I had missed a scene where the shoe dropped for the first time, and they were just rehashing it now. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom here on in I am going to break down the facets of the films in some semblance of order, so for those of you looking for a tl;dr: This is a disappointing entry in the series, especially considering the pedigree of involvement. Outside of two great action sequences, this is a bloated, passionless film that calls back to some of the franchise’s worst films while attempting to emulate the classics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe newest Bond theme, written in 20 minutes by Sam Smith and his musical partners, is, like the rest of this film, a disappointment. Shallow lyrics do not necessarily ruin it, after all Tom Jones showed off just how effective shallow lyrics can be in his legendary \u003ci\u003eThunderball\u003c/i\u003e theme, but the song just does not materialize around them. Crescendos seem out of place, and while Smith has an incredible vocal range, it is wasted on sections where his falsetto voice seems hardly appropriate. The booming orchestrations that backed up Adele on “Skyfall” seem to miss their cue, making the repetition of the song’s chorus, which is meant to harp on the theme of the film, seem like the least important lyrics. That being said, the opening credits sequence itself is quite impressive visually despite verging on tentacle porn (see the film, you know I am right).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow let’s talk about the characters and acting. Daniel Craig reprises his particular Bond in a similar way as the previous three films: he’s cold, brutal, emotionless, and often times has few words about his situation or feelings. While these work to be the definition of cool in two of the previous three films he has done, here it most strongly resembles \u003ci\u003eQuantum of Solace\u003c/i\u003e in his lack of ability to be invested in the proceedings. One particular car chase through the streets and canals of Rome exemplifies this best as there are shots of Craig looking more bored than I was. His collected nature worked in \u003ci\u003eCasino Royale \u003c/i\u003eand \u003ci\u003eSkyfall\u003c/i\u003e because there were vulnerable, emotional, and charismatic characters for him to play off of, and this film constantly reminds of their existence to its own detriment. Christoph Waltz’s performance as the mysterious Franz Obenhauser is the biggest offender in this category. His essential character trait seems to be merely aloofness as he never really reveals his motivations for getting involved in Bond’s life or how he came to be involved with \u003ci\u003eSpectre\u003c/i\u003e. Instead he is given approximately 30 minutes of screen time and very little dialogue to get across that he is menacing in some way, yet we never see him be menacing. The movie commits the cardinal sin of filmmaking by opting to tell rather than show its audience about its cast. Waltz gets to monologue to no end about how he was behind everything in the past three films (which itself is a stretch of the audience’s memory to expect them to be invested in the Bond of 2007). Additionally, his character is given a couple of twists within the film’s plot that he does absolutely nothing with, and no other character seems to care either. Lea Seydoux delivers probably the best performance of the film (not saying a lot), as she actually gets to shed some tears and demonstrate some emotion. Unfortunately her performance is undercut by a shoehorned romance a la \u003ci\u003eCasino Royale\u003c/i\u003e that has no basis in the film. Her particular Bond girl also lacks in any defining characteristic for the most part, acting as an amalgamation of all of them to the muted effect that one would expect. Bond’s team of M (Ralph Fiennes), Q (Ben Wishaw), and Moneypenny (Naomie Harris), are also forced into this plot but at the same time feels as though they are doing nothing. Bond’s interactions with Q and Moneypenny however are some of the brighter spots of the film’s poor dialogue, showing off some of the Connery esque charm that launched the series in the first place. These characters are dragged into a fight on the homefront for the very sanctity of espionage operation…yeah, exactly, but more on that in the plot section. In this fight we are introduced to newcomer, Andrew Scott as C, who \u003cb\u003e(SPOILER)\u003c/b\u003e might as well have had villain stamped on him from his introduction \u003cb\u003e(END SPOILER)\u003c/b\u003e. Former wrestler Dave Bautista acts as the Red Grant/Oddjob of the film, capturing the strength and kinetic energy necessary for the role, but only given one word of cringe inducing dialogue. Overall the performances best encapsulate this film’s failing, as each character is essentially going through the motions without any displayed motivation to do so. Their hollow performances echo the identity crisis of the film in being unable to do decide what sort of Bond movie it wants to be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe shots and production design are top notch as one would expect from a film of this pedigree. There really is not much to say on this particular facet as it is serviceable, though it should be noted that the film seems obsessed with a dichotomy between the Western world and the Eastern world displayed entirely by color palette choices. All of Europe is mostly grey, all of North Africa is brown, and that is about it. Mexico City gets trapped in weird grey-brown mixture that muddies some shots of otherwise well done cinematography.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe plot and script are huge failings. The film is divided into two conflicts that are meant to coalesce but never do in any meaningful way: Bond searching for Obenhauser and SPECTRE for unknown reasons, and C attempting to create a private organization that stories everybody’s information for “global security”.  The first part of the plot consists mostly of people telling Bond how dangerous his situation is, and him escaping that danger with literally no problem (this happens three times). Even in the classic Bond torture scene, he walks away without any issue and it is never brought up again, while his reactions during are so controlled that it’s impossible to empathize. It compares quite poorly with similar scenes in \u003ci\u003eCasino Royale\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eSkyfall\u003c/i\u003e where Bond’s torture tests his physical and psychological limitations in a way that is painful for the audience. Obenhauser’s scheme, which of course he delivers to Bond in a monologue, lacks an ultimate goal as he divides his time between world domination and the death of Bond. Mind you, this isn’t a classic situation where Bond has managed to get in the way of the villain, as Obenhauser seems to have a convoluted \u003ci\u003eSaw\u003c/i\u003e-esque plan for Bond’s demise that could’ve been escaped quite easily as the film demonstrates. Despite these complaints, it should be noted that it is this portion of the film that provides whatever interest is present in the film. The secondary plot is by far more tiresome, as C repeatedly harps on a sentiment that was overdone in \u003ci\u003eSkyfall\u003c/i\u003e to begin with, by telling M that he is old and C is new. This was permissible in \u003ci\u003eSkyfall\u003c/i\u003e because it is the crux of the film’s theme and mirrored the franchise in a meta way, but here it appears to be a lame attempt at topicality, like the switch to drug dealing villains earlier in the franchise, and an excuse for lazy writing. The ultimate sin that this side of the plot commits however is that the writers could not commit to even allowing C’s motivations to be genuine, despite his concerns about the double 0 program (007) being rather rational. After all, James spends the film causing millions of dollars of damage across multiple countries that most likely resulted in some if not extensive collateral damage. Of course C has to be proven wrong for the franchise to exist but why does he also have to be the bad guy? The film’s dialogue is simply poor. Bond’s exchanges with most characters are sparse, devoid of charm outside Q and Moneypenny, and often reduced to one liners that never land. Waltz delivers his straightforward “mystery villain” lines with nothing interesting behind them. Lea Seydoux is given some bits of interest in regards to her father, but these are abandoned half way through the proceedings in favor of love.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAction is present throughout the film though only portions of it are compelling. The opening sequence in Mexico City is a standout as a setpiece, and the homage to \u003ci\u003eFrom\u003c/i\u003e \u003ci\u003eRussia with Love\u003c/i\u003e halfway through the film is the best hand to hand fight scene the series has seen since that film. Beyond that, there are some car chases, a plane/car chase, and bouts of shooting that lack any emotional weight or energy. The aforementioned plane is such a ludicrous idea that it is immersion breaking, especially when the final result is shown.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are more specific criticisms that can be used against the film, such as the poor plot device of mouse that the film relies on, or the pointless call backs to much better films like \u003ci\u003eGoldfinger\u003c/i\u003e, but ultimately none of that would change that this is a massive step down in quality for a franchise that had delivered one of its most crowd pleasing entries in decades just three years ago. It sticks to the Bond formula to a fault, adding nothing and refusing to fix some of its demonstrated failings. This is a Bond movie that takes itself very seriously and expects the audience to do the same by layering a kind of mock gravitas over every event, resulting in totally watered down emotional beats. Coming off of the Craig saga, the franchise should be looking for new avenues to explore within the action genre while staying true to the essence of the Bond film. \u003ci\u003eSpectre \u003c/i\u003edemonstrates that the outdated formula in combination with persistent melancholic melodrama represents a bad path for the series (this is not \u003ci\u003eBatman Begins\u003c/i\u003e), and hopefully will act as a lesson to those who direct and act in the next installments.  It is not so bad a film to cripple the franchise, but it is a misstep for what felt like the verge of a Bond renaissance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eReviewed by:\u003c/i\u003e David Wright\u003c/p\u003e",

Joining the Ruffians for this evening of tactfully domineering guitars and sticky riffs will be Young Rival, the Canadian indie rock trio hailing from Hamilton, Ontario. This rock outfit boasts a sound that’s raw and hazy, yet discernable enough to come across as distinguished and effortlessly catchy all the while. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSaturday night, you can expect Young Rival to kick off what’s expected to be a very loud evening with plentiful material from their latest effort, \u003ci\u003eInterior Light\u003c/i\u003e. Their third studio album is characterized by tracks that are easygoing enough, but dark and melodic when they need to be. As a rock fan however, you might find that Young Rival’s sound is best experienced in its most uninhibited state: The live setting. Rival’s interesting mix of subdued moods and effervescent energy is a perfect companion to Born Ruffian’s signature act, and the performance will undoubtedly shake up an antsy crowd of teens and twenty somethings. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTickets are still available!  On November 14\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e, you too, can see Young Rival open for Born Ruffians at the Teragram Ballroom.  Doors open at 8, and the show is expected to start off at 9.

This was one of the few experiences in my life where I can solidly say I had absolutely no idea what to expect, and from my confusion about where one goes: shall I try my luck with this massive line or talk to the guy at the box office regarding my online ticket purchase, I\u0026rsquo;m sure everyone could tell I wasn\u0026rsquo;t supposed to be there. I had never even been a big fan of Bowling for Soup. Sure, like anyone else around my age at the time, I listened to 1985 a few times, but here and now, being dragged to this club by my self-proclaimed die-hard fan of a friend, that seemed like a lifetime ago. I had been able to brush up on their discography over the years, as long drives around LA provided this friend with a perfect platform to demonstrate her perfect imitation of lead singer, Jay Reddick\u0026rsquo;s, one of a kind voice, conveying all the teenage angst that any of us may once have been capable of while still being emitted by the vocal chords of a 40 year old. For her, they fell into the pantheon of pop punk, which, having run out of legitimate social issues to possibly provide a unique voice on, had shifted to deal with the never ending issues of \u0026ldquo;misunderstood\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;mistreated\u0026rdquo; adolescents. Sum 41, Blink 182, you name it, products of an audience rather than an era, that still clung onto the nostalgic hearts and ears of the faithful who longed for a simpler time in which they were the sole arbiter of right and wrong in the world and everyone\u0026rsquo;s inability to see it kept that particular young adult trapped in perpetual victim hood. This music had a time for all of us, and so this night would be the litmus test for this music\u0026rsquo;s relevance and enjoy ability, at least for myself and this friend of mine. Would it matter anymore? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOwing to my lack of experience with concerts Liz (the aforementioned friend) and I were totally unprepared for the announcement, upon our entrance to the venue, that the FIRST opening act will be starting soon. First? It was shocking enough for us that there was an opening act, but that there are instead multiple, and that as a result, bowling for soup would not even be on till at least11:00, this was simply unbelievable. We really had no choice but to stay for the entirety (she had decided to write a paper on this concert for a class), so we awkwardly found places in the crowd gathering in front of the small stage, and braced ourselves for what might appear there. I would say I attempted to drink the environment in, but doing so probably would\u0026rsquo;ve left me quite parched. The place was straight out of the dive bars featured in Scott Pilgrim vs The World, consisting of one black room, bar to the back, merchandise and tables on opposite sides, and their packed into the middle were the eager fans, being accosted by the occasional piercing light of the neon lamps on stage. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e~David Wright\u003c/p\u003e",

Nick has always focused on his new wave / pop solo project in addition to being in Surf Curse and is a genius at recording insanely catchy dance anthems that are - at the same time - carefully composed and capture such raw emotion in the efforts he makes in recording his music, using limited equipment for limitless ideas.

I talk to a lot of people and it seems that there’s really something going on in the culture, something really going on in rock music that is frightening and I don’t think a lot of people are paying attention to it. I always relate it to the end of classical music. How it had all of its time eras and at a certain point in the turn of the 20th century, people just started playing Beethoven and Bach all the time and they’re like “we’re not gonna we’re not gonna have original compositions because the greatest music has already been written.” It’s a very similar thing with rock music where we went through the birth of rock music and then the psychedelic era and punk and all this stuff. It’s reached this point where people are just recycling those genres, you have all these revival bands now, and now it’s gone into this “post“ world. It’s kinda sad and it’s kinda frightening but I’m also just trying to embrace it for what it is because it does affect me as a person and my ambitions as a musician. So I guess what I’m trying to do is just experiment. I’m not trying to change anything, but I want to make music that I wanna hear. Part of the recording process is trying to make it as raw as humanly possible and I wanna speak to people that are listening to it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEddie: \u003c/b\u003eDo you feel there was more of an influence towards me oh my mirror than simply transitioning from \u0026quot;TELE/VISIONS\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Current Joys”? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eNick: \u003c/b\u003e“I broke my loop pedal, which was my big thing. It had everything I used to record and then it broke. I couldn’t record anything cause I used my loop pedal to record every song. I wouldn’t even layer it - I would just do one and record over it, so I never got to play with levels on songs or anything. I bought an actual interface and that sort of beefed up the recordings a little bit and I tried my hand at mastering. That’s why it took so long to fucking record this album *laughs*. I recorded so many songs too! I must’ve recorded like 40 songs for this album and meticulously listened to it over and over to find where a song should go and how they should sound.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI fucking hate perfection because it just drives you mad, you know?

I’d have the loop pedal, the drum machine, I’d try to loop the bass track, and all that stuff. So I’m pretty much choking out what a live band would do.

Well if you’re looking for a\nreason, it is that I like horror movies. \nIf the genre was not so filled with utterly awful films, it would\nprobably be my favorite genre. Recently\nthere has been a dearth of horror films, as the genre was pulled down into the\npits of endless sequel nonsense, but finally a messiah has arrived in the form\nof the ultra-indie \u003ci\u003eIt Follows\u003c/i\u003e.  Viewing this film was among the most stressful\nexperiences of my life, causing great anxiety for hours, even days\nafterward.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, why does any of this\nmatter to a radio blog? Because of the\nscore of course! The score to this film,\nby Disasterpeace, a relatively well known chiptune artist, is far beyond any of\nhis previous work in both tone and complexity. \nIt is one of the most otherworldly collection of noises to hit cinema\nscreens, perfectly encapsulating the strangeness that permeates the film even\nat its calm moments.  In this way it\nechoes the classic horror themes of old, beginning with John Carpenter’s\nmasterful score work on the 1979 film \u003ci\u003eHalloween. \u003c/i\u003eCapturing a similarly eerie melody,\ncomplemented by an unrelenting rhythm underneath sets the viewer’s senses on\nedge from moment one. But to expand on\nCarpenter’s formula, almost as a way to shock jaded horror audiences out of\nfamiliarity, each piece includes notes that seem to not only be out of key, but\nout of place in the score as well. It\nperfectly emulates the situation of the characters by never allowing the\naudience to truly believe they have a grasp of the situation at hand. In the more pulse-pounding moments of the\nfilm, the score channels Bernard Herrmann’s iconic Psycho score, overwhelming\nthe senses in an incomparable way. The\nfilm is a symbol of growing ingenuity in the indie horror scene, and the score\nitself is very much a part of that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e~ \u003ci\u003eDavid Wright\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

How I ended up at this game is really a mystery because one minute I was enjoying the Thursday special of teriyaki chicken bowl at rendezvous than the next minute I was sitting in Pauley Pavilion watching our number nine team take on the unranked Oregon Ducks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe game was actually a lot more interesting than I thought it would be because everyone in the audience, including myself, assumed that our nationally ranked team would beat the Ducks in an easy three sets however this was not the case at all. The first set was what everyone expected out of the Bruins when they won 25-17. This set win was due to the mixture of the kills from Frager, Anderson and Ngauamo, the setting from Muno and the blocking from Rodgers and Felix to make this team look unstoppable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, the Bruins’ luck went down hill after this first set. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Ducks showed that they are a completive PAC-12 team in the next set by leading the Bruins the whole set, minus the first two points. The Bruins were leading in the beginning but quickly fell behind to lose to the Ducks 25-17.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow on to set three when the game got interesting because everyone’s assumptions about our UCLA teams ability went away but loyal fans still believed we could win the next two sets to take away the W. The third set consisted of nine ties and consent back and forth between the two teams that tested both their abilities. With a tie of 25-all, the Ducks then got two incredible kills to win 27-25.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Fourth: where the Ducks could take it all. However, our Bruins weren’t giving up just yet. I could not believe that a set could get more exciting than the third but it did by having 15 ties and eight lead changes causing these two teams to go back and forth on almost every play. The Bruins weren’t going to let the Ducks win without a fight so the end score of this set was 25-23 the Bruins with an amazing performance from all the team but especially Anderson and Felix whose kills were what won them this set.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, it was the battle to the win. The game that was suppose to be an easy 3-0 set win for the Bruins turned into a tie game going into the fifth set. The fifth set was nothing as exciting as the previous sets due to the fact that after a 3-all tie, Oregon took the lead in the set with a 15-12 win.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis match between the Ducks and the Bruins moved us down by only one rank to number 10. Even after this lost the Bruins proved that they are a strong team that is trying to prove themselves in the very completive PAC-12.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten by: \u003c/i\u003eEmma Nairin\u003c/p\u003e",

Hosting a different concert each night of November, I got the chance to catch Toro Y Moi at the recently opened Teragram Ballroom in Downtown Los Angeles on Day 9 of the series. This is the third time Chaz Bundick, the lead singer of Toro Y Moi, blessed me with his funk-infused indie rock band and it was by far my favorite—the psychedelic backdrop added flare to the entire experience. What I found most interesting is that Chaz was located stage right and the bassist was the center of the stage.

Walking out later in the wee hours of the next morning, I was another. Arguably, this transition would have occurred anyway the way it does for most of us. We experience whatever it is that we experience and it changes us, be the change moment to moment, minute to minute, day to day (etc.). In this particular case, however, I am going to make a special note of the person I was before I saw Greensky Bluegrass for the first time and the person I was after the taking in the show last Friday night. I would have to say of the two people I described here, the latter is my new favorite. I walked into the old Teragram expecting a show and got a full on Bluegrass hillbilly (punk) rock experience.

People trickled in and the music grew stronger and more soulful as the set progressed. There may or may not have been an issue with the set order – the energy built up, got down and then did an abrupt upward turn at the end. The shift was palpable and not necessarily in keeping with the vibe of a band who obviously puts a huge amount of thought into everything they do. Emails to band management went unanswered so we’ll never know. It was a successful and exuberant expression of rock’n’roll energy, but the end was question mark for me – is this the way they wanted to leave us? I was probably the only one who noticed – it was a very happy crowd, and wouldn’t you know it?  I was pretty happy too. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe break wasn’t too long (always appreciated, right?) and then out they came. Surrounded as I was with loyal fans wearing all types of Greensky hats, sunglasses, t-shirts and other assorted gear – I figured I was in for an interesting fan experience. Five men on strings walked out, lined up parallel to the edge of the stage, and proceeded to take the entire place and a fantastic, wild hillbilly punk rock ride to dancing oblivion. Dobro, mandolin, banjo, guitar and upright bass – it was a rock’n’roll acoustic bluegrass event. The band launched the first set with \u003ci\u003eDustbowl Overtures\u003c/i\u003e, and it became rapidly apparent that this was a) a singalong crowd, and b) a dance-until-you-drop type of experience. Up front was the place to be. When the band slid into \u003ci\u003eBurn Them\u003c/i\u003e, people got a little crazy. When toward the end of the first set they offered a rousing rocking cover of Springsteen’s Dancing in the Dark, the sing-a-long aspect got pushed about as far as it could go. Instrumental \u003ci\u003eClinch Mountain Backstep\u003c/i\u003e finished up the first set, which was a good thing given half the audience was about to drop. Energy was high and the smoke from both stage and audience was dense.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe music started up again VERY quickly, which worked with the vibe, and started off with a killer version of \u003ci\u003eRadio Blues\u003c/i\u003e. When energy gets this high in a crowd, its not always fun. However, to the credit of the band and everyone there, I was happily reminded of Dead shows in Berkeley when I was a kid: good vibes, happy campers, much weed smoke and incredibly fun music. The second set moved as fast as if not faster than the first, and dazzled with a strong selection from across Greensky’s body of work. A clear and awesome standout in what was already a standout show was a fantastic cover of Flatt and Scruggs 1967 \u003ci\u003eBringing in the Georgia Mail\u003c/i\u003e. Greensky’s version added pacing and a little punk rock ethos to the song, and in doing so honored the original in a great and lovely way. There was probably more than a tip of the hat to the Sam Bush Band cover of the same song.  It had beauty to it and some serious magic – I felt lucky to be there. Hats off. The wrap up and encore ended with attention grabbing cover of Springsteen’s Atlantic City.  I might normally raise an eyebrow at a band covering two songs by the same artist in a single show – but my eyebrows stayed in place. It worked. Everything about this show worked. When folks poured out onto the sidewalk to mob the taco trucks lined up on 7th Ave it was pretty clear that everyone there was exactly where they wanted to be, yours truly happily included in their number. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, the person I was before the Greensky show compared to after?  Before I probably wouldn’t have been quite as determined to dance until my vision shook and my head spun – but now I’m feeling the vibe and gearing up for the next show. Emails to band management regarding the set list were answered at light speed, btw – always nice. If you get a chance to take in this band – just go.  If you’re hip-hop, deep house, outlaw country or purely classical – it doesn’t matter.  If you can’t have fun at a Greensky Bluegrass show, you probably can’t have fun anywhere.  If you need to have some fun, quit your whining and buy a ticket already. Just go. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGreensky Bluegrass is based out of Kalamazoo, Michigan.  Band members are Paul Hoffman (mandolin), Michael Arlen Bont (banjo), David Bruzza (guitar), Anders Beck (dobro), and Michael Devol (upright bass).  They are totally awesome.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eReviewed by: \u003c/i\u003eAnastasia Gershman\u003c/p\u003e",

Instead it floats comfortably atop sounds of woodwinds, and is laced neatly between alternating strings. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis balance is one of \u003ci\u003eDivers\u003c/i\u003e’ stronger suits—The listener isn’t too distracted by one aspect to allow the overall composition go unnoticed.  This album isn’t exactly boastful, but once it has your attention it almost beckons you to be surprised by its unexpected “instrumental cameos” and stylistic changes.  “Leaving the City” for example, starts off like any other Joanna Newsom track before jumping into what almost feels like a prog-rock nod, especially with the drums and electric guitar chords uplifting the vocals.  Live drumming is an idea that sounds almost alien for a Joanna Newsom song, but this kind of instrumentation makes a couple of appearances on this LP, and it sounds just right when it hits.  Similar points can be made about songs like “Goose Eggs” and “Waltz of the 101\u003csup\u003est\u003c/sup\u003e Lightborne.”  Before you know it these two tracks sound nothing short of country ballads on both the vocal and instrumental fronts.  Revealing these outside influences hardly feels like a gimmick, and that’s largely due to the fact that Joanna can ease into these new territories almost seamlessly.  By the time you notice this change you’re already in the thick of it, and at least for me, the subsequent reaction isn’t one of questioning but rather one of gratitude, almost.  I find that this applies to the album as whole, too.  Each repeated listen catches me off-guard with some clever metaphor in the lyrics, or maybe an intricate little sound hanging in the background that I didn’t catch beforehand. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn short, \u003ci\u003eDivers\u003c/i\u003e is a very pleasing listen and it unquestionably continues the streak of quality albums under Newsom’s belt: It’s intricately constructed, surprisingly conceptual, and almost impossible to loathe.  My only complaints about this LP include the fact that the latter half is a little subtler and even abrupt in many instances.  And while I have many great things to say about this album, I still don’t think \u003ci\u003eDivers \u003c/i\u003eis the one to change the minds of listeners that were adverse to Newsom’s style on previous efforts.  Her voice and experimental tendencies are acquired tastes of sorts, but that makes for intriguing listen at the very least.  So yes, Joanna Newsom’s \u003ci\u003eDivers\u003c/i\u003e may be one of the more esoteric releases to hit the indie scene this year, but that doesn’t imply that it isn’t one of the most beautifully welcoming experiences of 2015 as well.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e~ Written by:\u003c/i\u003e Doug Gil\u003c/p\u003e",

It\u003ci\u003e \u003c/i\u003ecomprises five tracks, each around ten minutes long, each a balladic journey wavering between frenetic metal fury and spacey, shoegaze breakdown. Opener “Brought to the Water” marks Deafheaven’s return with knelling bells and a heavy burst of classic metal instrumentation that marches along to vocalist George Clark’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlnTWISE3fE\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDraugr\u003c/a\u003e-like growls.

So my advice to new listeners is to get past the growling and focus on the full-bodied chords and uplifting melodies. Deafheaven seems to craft every song for maximum cathartic effect. The chords on lead single “Come Back” are the most frisson*-inducing, but nearly every track has a climax that could work as the album closer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike on \u003ci\u003eSunbather, \u003c/i\u003ethe band makes ample use of airy, spacious intermissions to provide listeners a break from the saturation of \u003ci\u003eNew Bermuda’s \u003c/i\u003eintense parts. “Brought to the Water” ends with a lone piano part Elton John could probably work with. “Luna” drops its rhythm guitar in the middle to isolate the ethereal, reverbed lead and coasting bass. The entire second half of “Come Back” is clean and dreamy shoegaze, a pretty counterpart to initial rawness. Given their stylistic duality, and how deftly they diffuse two incongruous genres, it’s fitting that Deafheaven found** their name in Shakespeare’s “Sonnet 29:”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e         “I alone be weep my outcast state,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e          And trouble \u003cb\u003edeaf heaven \u003c/b\u003ewith my bootless cries”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis desperate pathos is apparent throughout \u003ci\u003eNew Bermuda\u003c/i\u003e’s metal portions\u003ci\u003e. \u003c/i\u003eBut just as “Sonnet 29” redacts upon its gloom:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e         “Yet in myself these thoughts almost despising,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e           Haply I think on thee, and then my state,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e           Like to the lark at break of day arising\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e           From sullen earth, sings gyms at heaven’s gate”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e…there is always an exalting answer,\u003ci\u003e \u003c/i\u003ethis shoegaze beauty that can be sad, ecstatic, wistful, cozy, or whatever depending on how you feel while listening. That the album demonstrates such emotional versatility and variance I think is important to many fans and to metal as a genre. Despite the allegations of some staunch metalheads that Deafheaven is “hipster metal” tainting the scene, I believe the opposite: \u003ci\u003eNew Bermuda \u003c/i\u003ecelebrates, and more importantly, humanizes metal as an immensely emotional and powerful form of expression, with as much grace as aggression.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003ci\u003eNotes:\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e*French for when something sounds so nice or strikes you in such a way that your skin prickles and undulates in waves of goosebumps.

At the Los Angeles stop on Saturday, The Greek Theatre Orchestra brought to life in stunning vibrancy over 20 years of video game music from the Pokemon games. People of all ages gathered in the amphitheatre nestled in the Hollywood hills to hear the soundtrack of their childhood. On a screen hovering above the orchestra, original game graphics augmented by realistic visuals kept attendees constantly engaged and enthralled.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe concert began appropriately with the intro theme music while the large projection scrolled through the title screens of all the games in chronological order. For someone like myself who has been playing Pokemon since Red, Blue, and Yellow Version were released, it was incredible watching the graphics morph through time and realizing how quickly the technology has progressed. After the introduction, the orchestra wound their way through every generation of Pokemon games in two 45 minute acts, playing highlight pieces from each.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eFirst up was the Pallet Town theme from Red, Blue, and Yellow, which cranked the nostalgia up to the max. The orchestral arrangements were absolutely breathtaking. I’ve been playing the games since I was 3 years old, but until that night under the clear Los Angeles sky, I had never realized how beautiful those 8-bit compositions really were. Live strings, vibrant horns, booming percussion, and more, created an incredible sonic tapestry as we watched Red go to Professor Oak’s lab and choose his starter Pokemon. The Team Rocket theme was bolstered by huge techno beats in an eclectic medley of classical and electronic music. I doubt any other orchestral performance held kids’ attention for so long.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eWhile the orchestra played a well-balanced repertoire of intense and calm pieces, it was the latter that truly shone. The Ekruteak City theme from Gold, Silver, and Crystal Version was the prettiest piece I heard that night, and one that I had nearly forgotten from the games. The credits theme from Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald Version was also wonderfully poignant played just on a piano with the rest of the orchestra softly backing it.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eAfter intermission, the orchestra returned with the universally known Pokemon Center theme before moving into cuts from the later generations - Black and White, and X and Y. While the pieces were still just as compelling, many adults in the crowd naturally began to lose familiarity. The encore brought everyone back together as the entire theater sang along to the much-beloved TV show theme song. The orchestra finally closed the night with a piece personally handpicked by the game director: “Kiseki,” from X and Y. Unsung lyrics appeared on the screen, leaving attendees with a final message of peace, friendship, and gratitude.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003ePokemon Symphonic Evolutions was the perfect tribute to a legacy of one of the most influential video game series ever created. At times it was hilariously nerdy, yet also powerfully emotional. If the Pokemon games defined your childhood as strongly as they did mine, it’s a can’t miss experience. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e~ Catherine Yi\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRecommended if you like:\u003c/b\u003e \u003ci\u003eWomen\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFollowing\n the release of their 2011 album Public Strain, Calgary’s experimental \nnoise rock band Women was unable to continue as a band due to the sudden\n passing of rhythm guitarist Chris Reimer. While music blogs and zines \nhaven’t really given the remaining band members the attention they \nreceived during Women, the bassist’s new project Viet Cong has more \nrecently become a popular Pitchfork favorite. While Viet Cong consists \nof two ex­-Women members, the band continues to move away from the \nexperimental, noisy, droney direction that Women left off in and are \nmore concerned with putting out “noise pop” songs. On the other hand, \nthe lead guitarist and vocalist of Women, Pat Flegel has been working \nunder three different monikers, all equally as abrasive and droney as \nthe opening track off of Women’s Public Strain, “Can’t You See”. At the \nend of 2012, Flegel released a tape titled, “Tatlashea” under the \nmoniker Cindy Lee consisting of eight tracks ranging from lighthearted \nWomen-­esque Pop songs like “holding the devil’s hand” to no­wave and \ndrone pieces like “assassination reality”. The recording quality of \nthese songs is somewhere between that of Public Strain and 2001 Nokia \nflip phone recording (maybe).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe following year, a more coherent \nand listenable 7” was released by Flegel under the name Androgynous Mind\n (originally a Sonic Youth song). The 7”, titled “Nightstalker” \nconsisted of five songs and are arranged on the record in a very tricky \nand confusing manner. The first side starts with “Bobbi” and “Good \nFriday”, which almost just plays as one song that gives the impression \nof a field recording of a bomb being set off in a drum store. Easily \ndismissable as just another pretentious noise project, the first side of\n the record doesn’t do much for the listener. Though a switch to the \nother side reveals three gems that seem more like unreleased Women \nrecordings. “Knock On My Door” remains as a personal favorite of the \ncourse of the past two years. Though continuing in the grimy lo­fi \naesthetic of previous recordings, the twangy, yet muffled 60’s pop sound\n Flegel creates using his Fender Telecaster induces a heavy wave of \nnostalgia for those who unofficially identify as Women’s cult following.\n The other two songs “Juanita” and “Desert Corpse”, continue in the vein\n of Cindy Lee’s experimental recordings in a more minimal and restrained\n manner. While one might dismiss the proliferation of Women-­esque \nrecordings coming out of Calgary as alienating, pretentious and \nrepetitive, the projects formed from the ashes of Women are a sure­fire \nway to satisfy one’s search for contemporary noise music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e~ \u003ci\u003eJake Stutz\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

We value a critic who can offer\nthe best interpretation of a work, just as we admire the artist for her creative endeavor. But, I\nthink the most consistent measure, albeit one not necessarily present, for qualifying ‘art’, is the\nemotion a work evokes. This is precisely where \u003ci\u003eThe Leftovers\u003c/i\u003e flourishes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe Leftovers \u003c/i\u003eis a feelings show—it’s about feelings, it makes you feel feelings. The\nbiggest success of the show is its ability to connect you with the mood of any situation. Its plot is\nis posed as being completely feasible and real, despite the unbelievability of its preliminary\nconflict: one-fiftieth of the world’s population disappears in the blink of an eye. The story takes\nplace in our own world, but this preternatural occurrence gives a platform for characters to\nreevaluate their lives and imposes the question of purpose onto the rest of the world’s players.\nSurely, a viewer can substitute the Happening for some post-modern advent, like the information\nrevolution or the rise of Donald Trump; but the feelings of uncertainty and hopelessness that the\nsearch for purpose evoke feel much more important for the show than do whatever the\nHappening possibly symbolizes.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy are the feelings more important than the possible symbolism? Because feelings are\nunifying.\u003ci\u003e The Leftovers \u003c/i\u003ereminds us that horror is less horrible when shared. Each player involved\nin a horrible situation can mitigate the fear by taking on a small piece to unburden the load for\neveryone else. (Think: being in a large group in a haunted house maze.) This reminder is relevant\nfor the characters of the show and similarly relevant for establishing the show as ‘art’ for it\neffectively evokes the same emotion across any audience.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second season of the show finds the central family—the Garvey family—in a new\nlocale: Jarden, Texas. The move is motivated by the family wanting to escape the problems\nencountered in their hometown, but they find that a new location brings its own problems, and\nthat you can never escape your character. With two episodes left this season, viewers are in the\nmidst of experiencing the characters confronting themselves, questioning if love can serve as a\nfunctional savior from earthly limbo.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStellar acting and a moving score alone merit the show as being an upcoming great.\nHowever, I haven’t given due respect to the great writing.

The loss drops their record to 7-3 on the season, effectively eliminating any chance the Bruins had at making the College Football Playoff.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are some positives following the loss though, as the entire conference was shaken up over the weekend.

Trips to Utah and USC should be beneficial to true freshman quarterback Josh Rosen, who established himself as arguably the best quarterback in college football this past weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRosen had a phenomenal performance against the Cougars this weekend, almost sealing a win for the Bruins with a 37 yard touchdown run to take a 27-24 lead late in the fourth quarter. He continued his streak of consecutive passes without an interception to 189, with his last interception coming against Stanford on Oct. 15.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the remainder of the year, UCLA is still in control of its own destiny, as they can win the Pac-12 with by defeating Utah, USC, and the eventual Pac-12 North champion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOptimism remains mostly though for UCLA’s upcoming seasons.

The gist of it is that my generation has seen substantial and impressive change in the area of LGBTQ rights. Young people of every gender and persuasion (in Los Angeles at least) walk down the street hand in hand, share affection, live their lives more openly than their predecessors - and it’s beautiful. It was always beautiful, but now they can share it with the world a bit more freely.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo why do I feel apprehension when the subject of Gay Rights comes up? Here\u0026rsquo;s why:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the show on Friday, one of the artists mentioned that some radio stations won’t play their music because they deem it “too progressive”. This means the music tackles subjects like same-sex romance with the same reverence and attitude as the traditional boy-girl love songs. We have come a long way, but this saccharin sweet G rated little love song can’t get played on the radio? Listen up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eI saw a little bit of what life was like before. I remember being frightened for my life when my highly effete friend faced down a group of homophobic frat boys in a McDonalds in 1986. I remember seeing black eyes, bloody noses, cringing men puking up blood on the sidewalk while the gang roughing them up went in for few more kicks. I remember boys being thrown out of their homes at 12, 13, and 14; and others in the Midwest were lynched and left to die with razor wire wrapped around their throats. Girls who dared to claim themselves as anything other than needing a man were raped, stripped in public, humiliated. Even now if a girl rejects a man’s advances its common enough to hear the words “Fucking lesbian…” as the loser who is unworthy of any woman’s attention tries to reclaim his lost honor. Doesn’t matter than he never had any in the first place, because he can just blame it on the women who refuse to respond to his toxic gaze. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat does all of this have to do with my feeling of apprehension?  It all still frightens me deeply, down into my bones. I’m afraid that all of these advances and all of this progress that we have made could be taken away. I’m afraid that marriages that people waited decades to seal will be invalidated. I’m afraid that children in these families will go back to fistfights every day at recess when some 2nd grader talks smack about the parents he or she loves. I’m afraid that everything gained will be lost. If you say that’s improbable, look at the Civil Rights Movement and tell me we  haven’t lost a substantial portion of the ground we once gained (I’m talking about you Voting Rights Act).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I was a teenager in the 80’s I feared for anyone who claimed sexuality outside of the heteronormative standard. You didn’t know what was going to happen to them. To some degree that risky area between heterosexuality and everything else still exists – but it’s been getting better. Really. And the sad and scary time when I grew up was better than the decades before. There has been progress. But still, radio stations in this country won’t play music by a band that is about as offensive as a cherry coke because it’s “too progressive”. This is a red flag to anyone who thinks that the struggle is over. This is a warning to you, if you are one of those people who believes in equality. Don’t rest on your victories. Don’t imagine that this is over. Don’t think that these new freedoms can’t be taken away. We have to keep fighting. If this doesn’t seem like the forum for this kind of rant, totally not sorry. I went to this show and this is where the events that transpired took me. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll that being said the show was fun. Sawyer Fredericks opened, fresh off his victory as winner of the The Voice last year. I will honestly say that someone in the audience told me that. Until then, I had zero idea of how this sweet and fresh faced sixteen year old with an otherworldly voice had attracted legions of middle aged and even senior women who screamed his name as if he were Paul McCartney in 1964.  He performed a series of original songs playing an acoustic guitar. His instrument and vocal skills notwithstanding, the set suffered from a lack of diversity. He is writing his own material and evidently understands song structure and vocal delivery, but one song blended into the next and then into the next. I would have appreciated a few covers of artists like Merle Haggard or Willie Nelson, whose influences are reflected in his playing and composition. It looks like he’s set to become a very big star. As he moves forward and matures as a songwriter, I think it will be an awesome career. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA Great Big World wandered onstage after a super-short break, bringing a talented and enthusiastic back-up band. The set consisted mostly of new material off of the album When Morning Comes set to be released this upcoming Friday, November 13. This band hails out of the NYU musical tradition – which is to say non-mainstream in look and sound without necessarily screaming out “rebel”. Their sense of humor was in place and lent a very personal feel to what is already an intimate venue – it was appreciated. Given that the show was intended to serve as a release event, new songs dominated, and the crown responded with restrained emotion. Things fired up toward the end as they launched into more established hits like “Say Something” and then visited the first single off of the new album “Hold Each Other”. Hip hop artist Futuristic jumped on stage to lend a few words in this last selection, much to the surprise of a very happy audience. “Shorty Don’t Wait” brought Sawyer Fredericks to the stage for a great sing-a-long type of experience and the show ended with an encore performance of “Rockstar”. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat can I say? A record release event always trots out new material that hasn’t made its way into the anthem arsenal yet, and the set was a reflection of that. The crowd ate it up, everyone left happy and by 11pm most were heading out the door in search of all the fun that Boystown has to offer on a Friday night. Overall notes were that the show suffered from a lack of consistency in the energy department, but that the charm and humor of the performers held it together even when the music and overall tone failed to stay in place. Good show, killer venue, extremely awesome people watching, and some serious food for thought as evinced by the first portion of this review.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eReviewed by: \u003c/i\u003eAnastasia Gershman\u003c/p\u003e",

What were you guys listening to that went into this record?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was listening to a band called The National a whole lot. A lot of indie rock from a couple eras ago, like Modest Mouse, The Shins, The Strokes. Some new bands that are around doing revival stuff, like Beach Fossils, Wild Nothing, Real Estate. Just like soft rock, indie rock bands, I would say we listened to the most. There’s also some retro stuff in there, like The Smiths, The Cure, New Order, Joy Division. It’s really all over the place. That’s just me personally. Casey, Danny, and Eric all have eclectic tastes in music. Eric and Danny both really like rock like Oasis, Dinosaur Jr., stuff like that. Casey’s pretty mellow. He’s really into Mac Demarco, The Growlers.\u003cbr/\u003eSo we’re all over the place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDid you change anything with your songwriting on this record or were there any specific goals you were really shooting for on this one?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is the first full-length that we’ve done with Eric being a member. We wrote \u003ci\u003eMagnolia\u003c/i\u003e when the band was in a tumultuous place as far as members go, so that was a bit different. This is definitely our most collaborative record, which is one of the reasons that I think that it’s better. It’s a bunch of minds working together rather than a bunch of ideas and just being like play this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eI’ve heard on this tour and your last tour that you’ve only been playing songs off this album. What’s the reasoning behind that?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn these tours, we’re pretty much just opening so we don’t have as long as a set. When we only have 6 or 7 songs, we want to showcase the new stuff as much as we can. If we had a longer set where we had the opportunity to showcase the record on top of playing older stuff we would, but if we’re gonna be limited to only a few songs we want to play the stuff that we feel most accurately depicts the band.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eYou guys have been touring a lot. You’re literally coming back here in a month. Do you see the touring continuing into next year with headliners or maybe just longer sets?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI can’t say anything for sure. We’re off all December and then in January we go to Europe with Citizen. Then next year, we’ll still definitely be touring on the record, trying to get it out there, but nothing confirmed yet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDo you guys consider yourselves part of the emo revival?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI don’t consider us part of anything.

I think that there’s happy songs. Realistically I feel like \u003ci\u003ePeripheral Vision\u003c/i\u003e is the happiest record we’ve put out in a while. “Sasha” and all those old songs are definitely tinged with a lot of angst and I feel like \u003ci\u003ePeripheral Vision\u003c/i\u003e is the most dynamic in terms of the spectrum of emotions.

It was one of the most rewarding and exhilarating moments of my life so far. I clocked in around 2:22:15 or something very close to that for the 13.1 mile trek through Disneyland, Harbor Blvd, and Angel Stadium.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere really is some renounced mental poeticism as you run. It’s beautiful, and frankly a little odd how focused you can become as you run for such a long period of time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCity Slickers: The Bob Larsen Story is a film parallel for exactly the act it represents. At times it’s a very odd, the montage sequences are abrupt and choppy. The Instagram-like still shots of nature juxtaposed with close-ups of Larsen or of someone running from the background into the foreground is anything but oblivious for its intentions. The film seems to try to make some parallel from Larsen, and to an extent his runners, to Mammoth Lake—the running ground for his trainees—as if to yell at you that he isn’t just some city slicker, ‘HE’S MORE THAN THAT DAMMIT!!!!’\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat City Slickers lacks is stylistic continuity in delivering its message, and honestly, I’m still not entirely sure what it was. It featured the History Channel style montage of interviews and archival photos coupled with what was an attempt at motivational music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbout a quarter-way through the film I didn’t know if I was going to finish it. The odd cuts where the screen would cut—not fade—black for about 2 seconds then fading in to some romanticized shot of nature had me feeling empty. What kind of connection was it trying to make? Like a donkey’s ass with lipstick on it, it was trying to be more than it was.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs I stuck it out, I began to forget or care how the film was shot. Bob Larsen just has ‘it’. That type of reserved intangible quality where you really didn’t need to know much about him to see how great he was.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt didn’t matter whether I could exactly pinpoint what made him great, I just knew, and that’s definitely something this film was successful at capturing. As he would talk the score would quiet so that you could not only hear, but more importantly, feel what he had to say. It really captures Larsen as a simple man with something indescribable about his being.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, this isn’t the type of documentary that’s going to be nominated for any awards, but it has an enjoyable subtleness to it carried by its subject.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis documentary isn’t about a man who’s going to be in elementary school textbooks or anything similar, but it is about some farm boy who grew into something admirable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCity Slickers is however, a documentary that captures a contagious greatness permeated by one hell of a human being.

Directed by Todd Strauss-Schulson and starring Taissa Farmiga (\u003ci\u003eAmerican Horror Story\u003c/i\u003e) and Malin Akerman (\u003ci\u003eWatchmen, Children’s Hospital\u003c/i\u003e), the movie centers around a group of modern teens predisposed with modern feminist ideals, who are then sent into the backdrop of a cheesy, summertime, slasher B-movie. Once there, Max (Taissa Farmiga) must escape the vindictive hands of a killer while reconciling the loss of her mother (Malin Akerman), who is present as one of Camp Bloodbath’s counselors awaiting a scripted death. The film’s aim lies somewhere between critique and homage, toying with the film’s meta-structure to elicit a laugh or to bring up the more poignant critique of the ‘final girl’ trope in horror cinema.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eCoined by Carol Clover in her book “Men, Women and Chainsaws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film”, the ‘final girl’ is the virginal, tomboy-ish female character who outlives the rest of the cast, and ultimately lives to see the downfall of the film’s antagonist. It’s a trope often played out to suggest that this ‘final girl’ is somehow more deserving of survival because she appears to be more wholesome and less sexually available. Clover goes further to analyze the genre under the Freudian lens, stating that each murder is a symbolic act of sex. Each girl is stabbed with the conveniently phallic-shaped knife, causing for some sadistic free associations. This wholesome girl’s shift into the role of the weapon-wielding heroine is, in Clover’s view, a masculinization of the female protagonist. Her donning of the same phallic-shaped knife is then assumed to be the source of empowerment for taking down the killer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe film deliberately calls out the trope for its misogyny while playing along with the rules of this kitschy, alternate universe. It’s intentionally goofy at times, and drippingly heartfelt at others, to the point where sincerity and flippancy melt to a dangerous point of confusion. The film’s central romance between Max and the ‘sensitive nice guy’ love-interest played by Alexander Ludwig (\u003ci\u003eThe Hunger Games\u003c/i\u003e, and hilariously, \u003ci\u003eThe Final Girl\u003c/i\u003e (no joke)) is obvious and disinteresting in the midst of a more eccentric cast. Adam Devine (\u003ci\u003eWorkaholics\u003c/i\u003e) and  Angela Trimbur (\u003ci\u003eHalloween II\u003c/i\u003e) play the respective horror movie stereotypes of the ‘dumb stud’ and ‘airheaded party girl’ with just enough accuracy and outlandishness to make a mark. A lot of the strongest comedy comes from Thomas Middleditch (\u003ci\u003eSilicon Valley\u003c/i\u003e), an oblivious fanboy who seems to resemble a stereotype from the spoof movie genre at times. Nevertheless, Middleditch interacts with the B-movie scenery with a giddy awe that drives the film through its most absurd and suspect moments. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne strength of the film is its art direction, which resists the urge to settle with the classic 80’s movie style and rather assumes an augmented, hyper-real visual palette. The airbrushed and modern CGI visuals catch one off guard in this supposed B-movie world. It’s reflective of today’s blockbusters, which will someday (though many already do so) be laughed at just as ridiculous 80s slasher scenes are now. As these modern teens enter into the vintage and trope-laden landscape they alter its contents to match their own culture of blockbuster effects and trendy tumblr-isms. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen \u003ci\u003eThe Final Girls\u003c/i\u003e came out, it was debuted and followed by a Q\u0026amp;A session with Strauss-Schulson and one of the film’s writers, M.A. Fortin, at UCLA through “Melnitz Movies”. Though the film wavers between self-awareness and incapacity, the story is held together at its crux by the mother and daughter dynamic. Even through the goofy and garbled antics that frame this central narrative, the emotion translates as Max comes to terms with her loss. When it comes time to realize the twisted rule of the ‘final girl,’ there is a knowing between mother and daughter, and perhaps a knowing for the audience that, that’s just how movies go.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e~ \u003ci\u003eReviewed by:\u003c/i\u003e Dylan Karlsson\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "The Beat Will Never Die: Underworld \u0026 Jungle @ Hollywood Bowl, 06/21/2015",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003eThe summer solstice occurs when the tilt of a planet\u0026rsquo;s \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-axis\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esemi-axis\u003c/a\u003e is most inclined toward the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star\" target=\"_blank\"\u003estar\u003c/a\u003e that it orbits. For us, the citizens of planet Earth, that date is June 21st. It is the official beginning of summer, the time of vibrancy and energy; the crescendo of the seasonal cycle, if you will. What a fitting date for a night of two performances displaying the ever so different points on the electronic music spectrum in a resoundingly similar energy.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKicking off KRCW\u0026rsquo;s World Festival of 2015 were Jungle, one of the finest exports to come out of the UK in the recent years. As I entered the Bowl I was very curious to see if Jungle\u0026rsquo;s renowned live performance could actually live up to the standards of the venue, as both in terms of capacity and the fact that that same stage had hosted some of the greatest musicians of all time, I was anxious to see whether Jungle would be able to sustain and deliver the energy that forms the heart \u0026amp; soul of their band.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe electrifying body and soul of Jungle shook the crowd to their bones. It is impossible to watch Jungle and not be mesmerized by the energy that pours out of their performance. Tom McFarland and Josh Lloyd-Watson have made the conscious decision that they want to be a band that differentiates themselves from others by their live performance, and boy do they deliver. With their funky guitar grooves reminiscent of Nile Rodgers and a dominant keyboard sound that can only be described as \u0026ldquo;what would Herbie Hancock sound like if he was born in London in the 90\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rdquo;, Jungle gave a performance that was just the right mixture of raw energy and funky sounds. The band played most of the tracks from their self titled 2014 debut, with tracks like Time, Busy Earnin\u0026rsquo; and Julia forcing everyone from the front row to the nosebleeds off their seats to dance like they were at a rooftop in Peckham. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the sun went down and the lights faded out, Karl Hyde, Rick Smith and Darren Price; also known as Underworld, took the stage. Touring in support of the reissue of their 1994 classic dubnobasswithmyheadman, the band kicked things off with Mmm\u0026hellip; Skyscraper I Love You. The subtle rhythm underlying the track immediately transformed the Hollywood Bowl into an open air club. The strobe lights flickering inside and around the dome of the stage helped the vibe become even more resonant, and when Hyde\u0026rsquo;s vocals kicked in it was already apparent that the band before us was undoubtedly one of the greatest electronic music acts of all time. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnderworld made their way through classic tracks like Rez, Spoonman and Jumbo as Hyde kept on showing that even while he\u0026rsquo;s approaching his fourth decade as a performer, his energy on stage is a force to be reckoned with. The visuals were gorgeously planned to emphasize the eclectic style Hyde displays on stage, as he transformed himself into a sinister electronic music devil with his mimics and dance moves. The drums pounded ever so lightly and consistently as the crowd danced their way through the night, with glow sticks in their hands and a smile on their faces.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the night was approaching an end, the band rounded out their set with two of their essential cuts. \u0026ldquo;You bring light in!\u0026rdquo; echoed Hyde\u0026rsquo;s vocals as the pulsating synth lines of Two Weeks Off sonically shook the Bowl. The last tune of the night was arguably the most famous Underworld track, \u0026ldquo;She said come over come over, she smiled at you, boy.\u0026rdquo; cried Karl Hyde as the iconic Born Slippy brought the evening to an end. The word Solstice is derived from the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLatin\u003c/a\u003e words sol (sun) and sistere (to stand still), yet ironically on the 21st of June, 2015 at the Hollywood Bowl; the sun was nowhere to be seen, and nobody was standing still.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2400\" data-orig-height=\"1600\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4c9c7302cfce2e7a7564817598679f09/tumblr_inline_nqprzcHfdz1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-width=\"2400\" data-orig-height=\"1600\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\n\nPhoto Credit: Victor Frankowski\n\n\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e*photo taken from \u003ca href=\"http://www.underworldlive.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.underworldlive.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e~Hakancan Altiner\u003c/p\u003e",

data-orig-height=\"450\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eHosting the Pepperdine Waves at Pauley Pavilion on Thursday night, as it turns out, the UCLA Men’s Basketball team was the one doing most of the peppering and the dining.  \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Bruins coasted to an easy 81-67 victory over their WCC counterparts in front of a home crowd of 6,063.  Five players scored in double-figures, led by 19 points from junior guard Bryce Alford and 15 points to go along with 15 rebounds from senior forward Tony Parker.  Freshman Aaron Holiday added 16 points, 4 rebounds, and 4 assists while fellow newcomer Prince Ali posted 12 points and junior Isaac Hamilton added 10 points.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eUCLA’s offense, which had sputtered for long stretches over the course of their first two games of the regular season, was firing on all cylinders Thursday.  The team shot an impressive 50 percent (30-for-60) from the field for the entire game as head coach Steve Alford’s offensive sets really let the UCLA guards push the pace, go downhill, and make plays.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhereas the team often suffered from aimless ball movement, careless turnovers, and inefficient shot selection against Monmouth and Caly Poly, that was solved in large part against Pepperdine through off-ball motion, drive-and-kick action, and a healthy dose of corner three-point attempts.  The Bruins used their newfound offensive revival to jump out to a 29-11 lead within the opening ten minutes and never looked back, leading by as many as 20 in the second half.  Though Pepperdine got the deficit to within 10 by the closing minutes, they never saw the lead at any point of the game.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was also an inspired effort by the Bruins on the defensive end as they allowed the Waves to shoot just 38 percent for the evening (including just 4-for-20 on three-pointers).  The team was defending with energy, clogging the paint and the middle of the floor, and fighting for loose balls.  While they did concede far too many second and third chance opportunities to the opposition (19 offensive rebounds for Pepperdine), the Bruins contested without fouling (just 14 free throw attempts by the Waves) and looked like a cohesive unit in their zone defense for much of the night.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Now this is three games in a row playing big-big that we’ve been in the 80s, so offensively, things are starting to smooth out,” said Coach Alford after the game.  “Overall offensively, it was pretty good.  Shoot 50 percent, we had a good inside-outside approach.  We took good shots, high-percentage shots.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The positive was the defensive end,” Alford continued, turning the attention to the other end of the floor.  “We gave 34 and 33.  We haven’t done that yet this year in back-to-back halves…Other than the backboard, obviously we gave up way too many offensive rebounds, but I thought defensively, our second half got a little bit stagnant offensively, but we didn’t lose any points because our defense was pretty sound…I thought this was the best game we had to date on contesting shots, forcing teams into some difficult shots, and I thought that was a big key.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 50-year-old head coach also praised son Bryce, the team’s leading scorer on Thursday, saying “I thought Bryce did a really good job leading.  That’s the most vocal he’s been.  He’s learning to deal with that mouthpiece now where he can take it out and talk.  And I thought he did a really good job leading us on both ends tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I think we came together, especially Isaac, Aaron, and myself,” said Bryce for his part turning to the chemistry of the guard rotation.  “We gotta play together to help this team win and I think we did a much better job taking care of the ball and getting us in offense and getting us back on defense and getting things set.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Just gaining confidence in practice,” added Holiday when asked to the key behind his own stellar performance on Thursday.  “Playing against Bryce, Isaac, and Prince just helped me get in the game and be more confident and staying in attack mode.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eParker meanwhile commented on his slowly improving frontcourt dynamic with seven-footer Thomas Welsh, who finished with 6 points and 6 rebounds.  “Just talking with Tom and getting him on the same page with me.  That’s basically what it is.  Me as an older guy.  I let Tom listen to rap and he makes me listen to country.  Those are the kind of adjustments you gotta make when you’re playing with somebody and you really wanna get the camaraderie down.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Bruins are feeling that camaraderie right now, and with the team set to be tested at the Maui Invitational before a date with CSUN followed by a true David vs. Goliath matchup against college basketball powerhouse Kentucky, it couldn’t have come at a better time.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten

In contemporary spoken French however, the translation would be closer to “cocktease”.  It’s not a nice thing to say to or about anyone. A boy in Paris said it to me once when I when I wouldn’t go out with him on a second date.  I guess he wanted more. After seeing Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse, I finally knew how he felt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eScouts Guide starts out strong, and when I say “starts out” I mean the very first scene and five minutes of the film.  It opens with an indescribably funny treat of a scene that grabs you by the collar and whispers into your ear of the great ride that is soon to come.  Your eyes widen, your respiration and heart rate rise a little and you begin to anticipate a fantastic evening ahead of you.  Then the rest of the movie rolls and you realize you’ve been duped.  What you got up front is all you’re getting and you’ve been tricked into spending the evening with a movie you don’t want to spend time with.  The fact that you’ve spent your money, two hours of your life and dragged your now-annoyed significant other along for the letdown just adds insult to injury.  If you really want to see Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse, let me run down a few key bits for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne fantastic opening scene followed by a couple hours of bad ones.  One very funny zombie genitalia joke mid-movie.  One very NOT funny sexual assault of a zombie a few minutes later that still baffles me – did someone actually sit down and make the decision that this was appropriate? Yes, successful comedy locates humor in unpleasant subjects, but it didn’t find any in this particular joke.  Three teenage scouts tackle the zombie apocalypse, changing relationships and adolescent sexuality using a bad script and a pretty decent soundtrack.   It may have been a good idea at one time, but a quick IMDb.com check shows the story creator didn’t write the screenplay. Given that she has a track record the screenwriters don’t maybe they should have left her on the project. I would say the film is phenomenally bad, but it doesn’t have the charm of The Room, Showgirls, Battlefield Earth or Plan 9 From Outer Space.  If you miss it, I sincerely doubt that ten years from now you’ll be watching this at midnight in some indie theater throwing Barbie dolls in the air and engaging in scripted call-and-response.  It’s not fun bad.  It’s just bad.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCasting had a couple of high notes:  lead Tye Sheridan does what he can and given that there isn’t much to do, still brings sweetness to the lovable dork antihero. Sarah Dumont as a the strip-club-cocktail-waitress zombie killer is a surprise – she’s a gritty, sandy beauty with deadpan delivery that works here, even if the movie falls apart around her.  Patrick Schwarzenegger excels at playing a spoiled rich kid who torments people lower down on the food chain, but is that really a surprise to anyone? Cloris Leachman and David Koechner bring superior chops to a lost cause. Joey Morgan and Logan Miller do their best to rise to the occasion but are hamstrung by inferior material. Blake Anderson steals the show for five wonderful minutes, like lipstick on a pretty girl that comes off when you kiss her, only to realize it was all makeup – she’s not that hot.  In the case of Scouts Guide she also has really bad breath.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou’ve been warned.  Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse opens up with a brilliant and sexy tease of what is to come, and then proceeds to throw mud on your arousal for a whopping ninety-three minutes of your life that you can never get back.  If you want zombies and humor, Zombieland is still out there and waiting for you to come back home.  My advice is go back to her instead.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eReviewed by: \u003c/i\u003eAnastasia Gershman\u003c/p\u003e",

Some find the infectious bounciness of their synthetic sound akin to an indie take on EDM, some find the sound a blend of 80’s nostalgia and futuristic pop, and some reach catharsis through Lauren Mayberry’s emotional yet unforgiving lyricism. It was not hard to see their impending mainstream success after the momentum started with their debut, The Bones of What You Believe.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe sleek and soulful Mansionair opened the show, blending smooth-textured synths with more biting blues guitar. The frontman’s breathy and wailing voice which strikes resemblance to Hayden Thorpe of Wild Beasts soared at times but often got buried.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eNext, the resurrected poster boys of emo-revival, American Football, joined to play songs from their seminal album from 1999. Self-awareness was present in their set, as frontman Mike Kinsella jokingly introduced the band: “we’re the American Footballs.” Well-concocted layers of intricate guitarwork might have lulled for some, but it was clear a large portion of the crowd had not only come for the main act, but expressly for American Football. Moments from their set diverted to a simpler state of musical bliss, with all cutting out except for a lone, crooning trumpet. While the contrast was soon to be felt with Chvrches’ wall of synth, it was a welcomed respite before the show’s true energy came loose.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChvrches  arrived with concentrated bursts of spiraling synth that enlivened the crowd, segwaying into the album opener “Never Ending Circles.” Though their set was at first hampered by sound issues, the levels balanced out and Mayberry’s vocals could rise over the high cutting bursts of sound. Playing a balance of songs from their debut and latest album, the variety and pacing of set choices sustained the high energy of the set. The occasional dialogue between songs at times seemed offhanded, but fanboys and girls nevertheless laughed and cheered, no doubt a cause of Mayberry’s charm. Blazing through track after track with ferocity, the band closed with “The Mother We Share.” Exploding with that opening burst of voice and machine crunched into one, reminded all of that distinct Chvrches sound that first caught their attention.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2448\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f8ae499a03c442595510cb926e70737a/tumblr_inline_nxvi0vOsqo1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2448\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten by: Dylan Karlsson\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhotos by: Dylan Karlsson\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

And what happens when our ideas of it shift from one extreme to another? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe are a state of respective booms: the Gold Rush; the Film Industry; the Counter-Culture movement of the 1960’s; the Tech Boom, etc.  People don’t just come to California, they pour into it.  They explode from planes, trains, automobiles and ships to converge on her shores; into her stockyards, huddle in the backrooms of bars or the human resource offices of yet another technology startup gone into the stratosphere.  Everyone here is looking for something, or is the descendant of someone who was. Whether or not they find it, invariably they put down roots and become the proverbial California graft. Maybe the ground shakes a little from time to time, and those who aren’t really in it for the long haul depart for places where tornados or blizzards seem like manageable risk. The rest stay. They become part of the fabric of the place, weaving in their own longing for something better. Longing for get-rich-quick schemes, for easy sex, for fresh fruit off of the tree, for stardom.  All of this passion for unrealized dreams and the co-existing brutal realities of the place amalgamates somewhere along the way into a shiny reality that seems just a little bit tainted by fantasy – equal parts gold glitter, crude oil and human blood. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWelcome to California.  We hope you enjoy your stay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn her first novel, \u003ci\u003eGold Fame Citrus\u003c/i\u003e, Claire Vaye Watkins takes a deep dive into the desert ocean that the Golden State threatens to become in dreams we don’t remember about an apocalypse we deny will ever come.  In a Los Angeles largely evacuated of inhabitants after drought has ravaged the landscape into a twisted version of what it once was, Luz and Ray eke out an existence surviving on rationed colas, too little water and whatever they can scrounge from what has been left behind by the exodus of those with the resources and/or wherewithal to escape to greener climes.  The Los Angeles of Luz and Ray has become the last outpost for those who still make their home there: the criminals, poor, outcast, forgotten and neglected.  Those who remain even with sufficient resources to perhaps buy their way out stay behind in a state of emotional paralysis.  For one reason or the other, no one left behind is moving forward, and the only movement that is taking place is that of the nascent and gargantuan desert, the Amargosa, absorbing everything that comes in its path.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRay, an army deserter, and Luz, a model and once-was child celebrity, drift through their days without change or reckoning of time passing until one day they on impulse snatch a feral toddler from her equally feral caregivers.  Their act, given the parameters of the situation in which they find her and themselves, seems at once terrible and understandable.  Their break from inertia comes with the realization that taking responsibility for her obligates them to give her a better life.  When they leave Los Angeles heading eastward in hopes of crossing the desert, they enter a world of mirage, illusion and blindness.  An encounter with a beguiling cult leader in the desert exposes them to the extremes of rightness and wrongness in a place that glows with the same sunshine that kills those who get lost in it.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWatkins excoriates cult and culture alike in her gentle and hypnotic attack on celebrity, consumption and the integration of blessing and curse that California represents.   In a world of unrelenting beauty that kills everyone it touches, her characters survive by breaking apart, coming together and reinventing themselves in a merciless and unforgiving dystopia that is all the more frightening given its proximity to the California we live in today.  Everyone survives at the expense of another; success is determined by how much of yourself you will abandon to become someone or something else; and hell lives just underneath the skin of paradise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe book is prosaic in its witness of the end of it all; beautifully written, shockingly original, simple and easy to read.  Ideally it takes its place as a classic of California literature and a call to action for those of us still seeking dreams instead of nightmares in our lives here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eReviewed by: \u003c/i\u003eAnastasia Gershman\u003c/p\u003e",

Thus my night of juggling was just beginning. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’d made up my mind that Kenton Slash Demon and Classixx were my priorities while\nSophie occupied spot no. 2—unfortunately, all three artists’ times were conflicting.

The pop began to evolve into Sophie’s latest sound,\nemulating the trap EDM music that is commonplace in the cumbersome rave festivals of\ntoday. Although a trap sound was always at least available in Sophie’s repertoire, it is only now after much more garnered attention and one of his songs appearing in a McDonald’s ad that Sophie is candid in playing trap music. All of this is evidence that Sophie has truly achieved what he set out to do: become a pop star.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe concert-imperative-nodule in my brain began ringing and I knew it was time. I gave\na quick slap on the back to my friends and rushed down the Basement to witness Kenton\nSlash Demon’s opening.

The group of women swayed with a side-to-side dance action and\ncongregated. Like a council of tribal elders, the group reached a decision to send forth\none of their braves and engage in a mating dance. The first interacted with me,\noccasionally cocking her head back to see if I was paying attention or if I had left. I\nsmiled as a nicety, but the kind of false nicety that is not supposed to be seen as an\naffirmation, but rather an empty gesture—the kind not to be acted upon. Sensing\nrejection, the first brave returned to her tribe and another was sent in her place. This cycle\ncontinued with different braves opening themselves to rejection. Still, I admired their\nperseverance. This was the first group of the night to leave an indelible impression on my\nexperience, and if their fun time was ruined I wish they knew that my night was made\nbecause of people like them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"853\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/da1e257f27473fc545c201c6010209f0/tumblr_inline_nwwhzm058q1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"853\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter some minutes into the KSD set “Syko” played and I lost myself for a little while.\nWhile the song transitioned out I decided that Phase II of my plan had to be put into\naction. As I ascended upstairs and flew through the Theater it felt as if Classixx was\nawaiting my arrival. The lasers and lights dimmed. All was dark. The RHONDA sign\nmade of lightbulbs, functioning like a vanity to a star, lit up. The strobes flashed and “All \nYou’re Waiting For,” thumped from the speakers. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow the Belasco Theater felt like a\ndiscotheque, the strobes imitating a disco ball and the nu-disco sounds of Classixx\ntitillating the ears. A pair of middle-aged women taught the younger generations how to\ngroove. A locking of eyes revealed their lives to me—the slip into stagnation, their\nhusbands’ lack of trying, the existential boredom that filled their lives. They were\nresuscitated that night from the attention of twenty-somethings. Another glance. It was a\nlascivious invitation thrown my way. I had the power to ruin a life. Like an introvert\ndrunk on power from making Tinder decisions, the speakers resonated and Rhonda\nbreathed agency back into the lives of two women that needed a reminder of how fun life\ncan be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"853\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7b43e5cc3fe6d4230f75013795c2be07/tumblr_inline_nwwie4hsha1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"853\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eMore Kenton Slash Demon\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eClassixx climaxed and I rushed upstairs to rejoin my friends who were awaiting the finale\nat Sophie’s set. With a declaration of one-part concern and three-parts excitement that, “I\nNEED TO FIND MY FRIENDS,” the PLUR-friendly attendees allowed for an easy path\nto the front of the Ballroom where I could find my friends. Hugging and selfies ensued.\nIn uncanny fashion Sophie dropped one of his new songs “Just Like We Never Said\nGoodbye” as I found my friends. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA man in business casual clothes stood in rigidity.

Phase III of the plan could not be\nstopped. I knew how the night would end. I grabbed Zach and jumped down three stories\nmaking a safe landing at the entrance of the Basement. The chill of the Basement\nwelcomed us, so that I got goosebumps on my arm. It was coming. I danced. Soon, our\nclub corroborators showed up to complete the group dynamic. No time was wasted on\nhugs now. The low reverberations permeated my body and my being and the significance\nof the night, although irreproducible, hit me. “Harpe” played. My phone was dead so I\ncouldn’t videotape the moment. All I could do was be present. All I have are the\nmemories and feelings.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

One of them was to be close to people that I feel I could have similar interests and similar ideas with to express myself through my program and through my selections. Any form of appreciation for that just feels amazing and out of this world and I am very honored to be picked.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEddie:\u003c/b\u003e What do you garner influence from to create such a unique show as “Spectral Rhomboid”?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHakancan:\u003c/b\u003e I think the process that I use to prepare my playlists and my topics is that I don’t confine myself a period of time, like “I’m gonna do it the day before for each week’s show” so the whole week is basically like a canvas for me. I just listen to music, then I keep adding songs to my playlist. It kind of goes both ways in that both my feelings and ideas in the week shape my playlist and the stuff I listen to shape how I feel. That really interests me, like if I’m feeling moody, you can see it on the playlist, and since I keep listening to sadder songs or emotional songs, that makes me more sad as well, which makes for a very bad week but a very good show. I just feel like self-expression is a very important part of my show, both in my selections and the stuff I talk about, so I want to be as honest as I can in my selections and make the show a part of me. Not to discourage any other shows or any other DJs, but that’s how I see in my way a personal show should be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEddie:\u003c/b\u003e Do you have any advice for any shows looking for ways to improve their skills?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHakancan:\u003c/b\u003e I could advise potential interns or anyone who’s in UCLA Radio and doesn’t have a show in that the self-expression value of a show is very underrated. If you give yourself into the show, it takes a lot out of your mind, it takes a lot out of your conscience and it gives you a platform to express yourself. I think that both, it’s very relieving and liberating for a person and it makes for a very good show.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEddie:\u003c/b\u003e Based on what you play in your show, has ambient music been a big influence in your life or is it a recent interest?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHakancan:\u003c/b\u003e It was sort of like my teen angst phase when I first got into that music. For me, ambient music was like Slipknot and Fall Out Boy. I mean it’s still with me and present in my music taste. I grew a pallet for textures and soundscapes. It had mostly to do with the fact that I used to play a lot of “Football Manager” (it’s a game) and you don’t do much in it, you just build your tactics and shit. The good thing was there was no soundtrack so you could play whatever you want in the background, so if I played “Football Manager” for fifteen hours straight, that means I could listen to music for fifteen hours straight. The stuff that I did on “Football Manager” sometimes took a lot of attention in that I would benefit from having music on that didn’t distract me from what I was doing and that’s where ambient music came into play. So this was probably when I was a Freshman in High School, and it just kind of stuck around!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1912\" data-orig-height=\"1275\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/303247cadcc19a8496c4205303234bcd/tumblr_inline_nvkip6feLL1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1912\" data-orig-height=\"1275\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEddie:\u003c/b\u003e How do you feel being involved in college radio as opposed to other forms of radio, be it a local radio station, satellite radio, etc., gives you the opportunity to have the show you have?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHakancan:\u003c/b\u003e I think college radio is like a safe haven for genuine music fans in that it provides a noncommercial “don’t think about the consequences, just express yourself” kind of music selection, you know? It’s like a playground. I think UCLA Radio’s diversity in the programming lineup and how distinct the shows we have on here is a good reflection of that. College radio should not be like KROQ or a Top 40 station, it doesn’t have to have just one theme or sound and follow that.

I walked into the Observatory and was very\nshocked in how intimate the whole thing was, but then thought, “hell, it’s\nanother Ryan Hemsworth show, it’ll make for a very chill crowd.” Well, you know\nwhat, I’ve never been to a club or never have wanted to, but this show was an\nexperience that definitely felt like it can be considered “Club Night with Ryan\nand Tommy” or something and it was the first time I’ve ever felt okay with\nwanting to stay at something that felt like a club, but I digress. Nothing\nbeats a first impression than walking into a venue and seeing three huge pieces\nof cloth with spray paintings all over hovering above Tommy and Ryan’s stage\nsetup as a backdrop. I wasn’t able to see the left, but the right and center\npaintings were enough to not only crack me up, but get so hyped for the night:\non the right, huge spray painted versions of Ciara and T.I. stand in front of\nthree rappers I don’t even know the names of and in the center, Tommy, Ryan, a\nhuge wad of Canadian cash next to each of them and a blinged-out version of\nBart Simpson in between them. If this wasn’t enough to get myself going for the\nnight, I had three hours left in that venue to take more in, which I was more\nthan excited to do but also did not know what to expect.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"960\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ec6874095cc9f03f847b39c40270fde4/tumblr_inline_nqpu95BVvs1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"960\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eA good thirty minutes pass and\none half of the “Just Rap Tour” duo steps up promptly at 11pm and introduces\nhimself as “Tommy Kruise from Montreal.” Not having heard Tommy Kruise’s\nmaterial before, I thought I was in for a treat regardless but then Tommy\nflipped the script once he said “this is JUST RAP, we’re only playing rap music\ntonight so rock with us.” Prior to this, I actually had no idea that the tour\nwas called “Just Rap” for a reason. In fact, I thought it was something done\njokingly based on Ryan’s sense of humor via his beautiful internet presence,\nbut nope, this was real. This was happening. And it was amazing. Tommy began to\nplay a whole set of rap songs I have never heard of (with the exception of a\nYoung Thug song played in there somewhere) but in an instant, the crowd was\nvibing so hard. A few songs in, Tommy had the left side of the audience\nchanting “AYEEEE!” “AYEEEE!” until they made a party train and brought\nthemselves over front and center and influenced the whole crowd to chime in.\nPlaying remixes from local Montreal artists, himself, and his own friends,\nTommy Kruise played a spectacular set enough to allow the crowd to get ready\nfor what was coming next.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"960\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e4a9a12d56bd428e01347f24c2d44c8a/tumblr_inline_nqpu9ykpm91qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"960\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe one and only internet mogul Ryan\nHemsworth comes onstage while Tommy plays his last song and Ryan continues to\nprep for his set while appreciating his tourmate’s banger choice for the night.\nAt this point, the Observatory has already turned into one of the hottest,\nsweatiest venues I’ve been to and everyone is at peak hype when Ryan starts to\npick his rap choices for the night. Ryan’s choices were a little different than\nTommy’s in that Tommy chose the louder, heavier rap songs while Ryan’s are\nbased off of his remixes: which are somewhat dreamy and light with the\ntrademark xylophonic percussion rhythm used in a lot of his songs and other\ntypes of percussion similar to the sort. Over time, there would be someone\ncrying out, “I’m so hotttt” but damn it was worth dancing through the sweat and\nclaustrophobia. Ryan threw a ton of crowd pleasers from Fetty Wap’s “Trap\nQueen” to Jamie xx’s “(I Know There’s Gonna Be) Good Times” and even included\none of my favorite Ryan tracks “Cream Soda,” which was a surprisingly really\nfun song to dance to considering the chiptune beats and video game vibe it\ngives off. Even Tommy poked fun at his set when he went back onstage when he\ntold him “you didn’t even play rap tho, I thought it was supposed to be \u003ci\u003eJUST RAP\u003c/i\u003e?!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"683\" data-orig-width=\"1024\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/74e69b9ae1507d88f1332f0ae08c2528/tumblr_inline_nqpub7Xscj1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"683\" data-orig-width=\"1024\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter a hot, sweaty, two hours with Ryan and Tommy, Tommy heads back on\nstage and the two begin to do an additional, collaborative 30 minute mix of rap\ntogether. On top of that, they even responded to the crowd’s “WE WANT MORE!”\nand played an encore which was (I believe) an alternate mix of Ryan’s single\n“Snow In Newark” off of his latest album \u003ci\u003eAlone\nfor the First Time\u003c/i\u003e. Honestly, do not take my word for it, but yes, this is\nthe greatest club event in history and you should go now.

    "title": "4 Reasons Why Coachella Weekend 2 Is Better than Weekend 1",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003eIf you’re set on going to the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival \nbut unsure on if you want to go Weekend 1 or \nWeekend 2 let me help you, by presenting my…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e4 Reasons Why Coachella Weekend 2 Is Better Than Weekend 1:\u003c/b\u003e by Jeffrey Brownell AKA Captain Neopetz on Malibu Yacht Club Saturdays 6-8pm\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003e1. The Crowd Is Better\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe\n number one reason anyone would want to go Weekend 1 is to see and be \nseen. By that I mean Weekend 1 attracts celebrities and wannabe models \ngalore. This is the weekend that spawned the fashion blogs and so-called\n “coachella diets” that pop up every spring. Somewhere along the line \nWeekend 1 became some twisted fashion party fest. I am by no means one \nof those “Coachella should only be about the music” types, but Weekend 2\n really caters to those that are more interested in listening to dope \nmusic and having relaxed fun, rather than the “party only because you \nhave to” feel while beer ponging yourself to oblivion with your bros. \nLong story short, nobody cares what you wear or what you do during \nWeekend 2, and that’s the sort of environment where a genuine sort of \nparty really lets loose. And besides, if you go Weekend 2 (because I’m \nsure you’re not Vanessa Hudgens or one of the Jenners) even YOU can be \nthe queen of Coachella. That is, if I wasn’t already going of course.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e2. The Music and the Experience Is Better\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePractice\n makes perfect. It’s one of the wisest phrases in the English language, \nbecause it’s true. As far as music and performance quality Weekend 1 is a\n just a big dress rehearsal for Weekend 2. I would even say that most \nartists probably have a better time and really hit their “stride” after \nthe clusterfuck that is Weekend 1. Artists like Outkast and Pharrell \nthat got awful press Weekend 1of 2014 boasted drastically better \nperformances the second time around. Of course, the music isn’t the only\n thing that improves with Weekend 2 though. Everything from the food, \ncampgrounds, and security lines all get better with age, and nothing is a\n bigger boner kill than having to wait in line to have fun. Fortunately \nthe security lines for getting into the grounds and the festival itself \nbecome stream-lined and shorter (Pro Tip: possibly less thorough too), \nas they work out the kinks come the next weekend. Basically come to \nWeekend 2 if you want to sneak stuff in or just see better live \nperformances. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003e3. You Know What is Going to be Good and What is Going to Be Bad\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s\n just say that rule two doesn’t work out and some artists just suck no \nmatter what weekend it is. For example, let’s say you’re torn between \nseeing 2 Chainz and going back to your campsite because your buzz is \nstarting to wear off (true story throwback to 2013 me). Prior to getting\n to the festival you heard your friend that went to Weekend 1 said she \ntried to see 2 Chainz, but he showed up awfully late and only performed a\n very disappointing 15 minutes of his 45 minute set. Because you’re \ngoing the smarter weekend, you can bypass the disappointment, get your \ndrink on, and set up for something that’s going to be doper, later, like\n Hot Chip was for me. Sure stage hopping and discovering magical musical\n moments on your own is a big part of music festivals, but the press \nthat Weekend 1 gets gives you the opportunity to trim the fat and make \nyour festival going experience better and efficient when Weekend 2 rolls\n around.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003e4. You Close Out the Festival\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNobody\n wants to be the first to the party. At least that’s what I always \nthought anyway, so it seems awfully strange to me that people really \nflock towards Weekend 1. My favorite thing about Weekend 2 is simply \nthat I am the last one there. In essence, you’re shutting that \nmotherfricker down. I couldn’t think of anything more disappointing then\n going to Weekend 1 and seeing Snoop and Dre and a Tupac Hologram and \nfeeling that depressing, “it’s over feeling” only to realize that \nWeekend 2 is right around the corner and you’ll have to read about the \nhype for another week. It certainly works way better the other way \naround (see reason 2 and 3). Just be there when they close the door on \nCoachella until the next year, and you’ll know exactly what I am talking\n about.\u003cbr/\u003eSo if you heed my advice, next year \nwhen Coachella 2016 is done and the nasty hangover is over, you can pick\n your dust induced boogers and know you went the right weekend. You’re \nwelcome.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eMore info about Coachella Wristbands for 2016 can be found here: \u003ca href=\"https://www.coachella.com/2016-advance-sale-faqs/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://www.coachella.com/2016-advance-sale-faqs/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

We Were Promised Jetpacks performed at the Teragram Ballroom on November 20th, touring for their new album Unraveling, released October 3rd, 2015, and Seoul, who recently just finished their first U.S. tour, opened for them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeoul kicked off the show and from the get-go I could immediately tell that my friend and I were just about the only two people in the crowd who knew who they were—I don’t expect a WWPJ fan to know Seoul at all. But looking around, I could see the crowd dancing to the synth infused indie/electronic sounds. During “Stay With Us” from their debut album \u003ci\u003eI Become A Shade\u003c/i\u003e (2015) people were dancing in place, rocking to the reverb and lo-fi sounds emanating from their instruments. My favorite part of their set is when Julian, the front man of the band, talked about Los Angeles winters. “We’re very confused about your weather since we’re from Canada. November in Ontario is full of slush, not snow or rain, but a wet mixture of both and it’s freezing.” But regardless, he said, this weather reminded him of drinking red wine while cuddling with your lover.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter their set I actually got a chance to chat with Julian. I told him that my friend and I were able to catch their show at the Echo in September—he was very happy to know that we attended the only two shows they played in Los Angeles—and I asked him what his least favorite city from that tour was. He laughed, not expecting the question, and answered “Chapel Hill, North Carolina. There were like 4 people there and it was just awful”. He also talked about his experience when they stayed at his grandma’s house after having a show somewhere in Florida. “I hadn’t been in a very long time and so it was nice to see her. For some reason everyone in Ontario always has a house in Florida. Anyways, when I saw her she said, ‘Julian! Can you play that song that says ‘fuck’ in it for my friends’ (referring to “Silencer” from their debut album)? It was really embarrassing but funny”.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"2400\" data-orig-width=\"4006\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/52968c1938e5c844f294cc10c84fb9eb/tumblr_inline_nyt3m6LBmt1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"2400\" data-orig-width=\"4006\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e My friend also asked him what their album art represents and where it was taken. “That was taken at the Olympic stadium in Ontario. You know when a city hosts an Olympic games and build massive stadiums, only to be abandoned once they are over? This is what was left of those Olympics. My friend and I were taking pictures there and the picture on our cover is of me swinging my backpack in a circle. It kind of looks like I’m either entering the photo or dissipating from it, kind of like I myself am becoming a shade. That’s why we used it”. After our conversation he signed both of our vinyls!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe Were Promised Jetpacks started and the serene ambience that Seoul brought to the Teragram immediately changed to raw emotions mixed with nostalgia. They played “Ships With Holes Will Sink” from their debut album \u003ci\u003eThese Four Walls\u003c/i\u003e (2009) and the crowd became alive with energy. Everyone was reciting the lyrics almost as if the song had helped each member of the crowd in some different way—the emotion was indescribable really. The energy continued as the band played “A Part of It” from \u003ci\u003eUnraveling\u003c/i\u003e (2015) and “Keeping Warm” from \u003ci\u003eThese Four Walls\u003c/i\u003e (2009). During the five-minute instrumental introduction of the song, the crowd began chanting the melody and the collective effervescence was contagious: euphoric. Another moment like this was when they played “Sore Thumb” from their sophomore album “In The Pit of the Stomach” (2011). The song itself is very somber but hearing it live was breathtaking. Adam Thompson, the lead singer, puts the microphone to his diaphragm and begins passionately singing. As soon as he is finished, the breakdown begins and the crowd just goes into this synchronized head banging. The song is so powerful, drawing the same emotions as an Explosions in the Sky song.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"2448\" data-orig-width=\"3264\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f9bb385ef510e7ce32e4688fab9be854/tumblr_inline_nyt3ml6oRm1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"2448\" data-orig-width=\"3264\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy overall favorite part of the night was when the band played “Quiet Little Voices” from \u003ci\u003eThese Four Walls\u003c/i\u003e. A mosh pit broke out in the crowd and the funniest thing about it was I saw what appeared to be two 50-year-old men in the middle of it; the unity that this band brought was awesome. Every person in the crowd put their phones down completely entranced by the band. Hearing this song live for the first time in my life was such a pleasure. I have been a big fan of this band since I was a freshman in high school so it was almost as if I marked it off my bucket list. They finished their set with “Its Thunder and Its Lightning” from \u003ci\u003eThese Four Walls \u003c/i\u003e(2009), thus concluding probably one of my top 5 favorite concerts of 2015.

Before joining the Consulate, he acted as Deputy Ambassador for Israel to Kenya. While there he “spearheaded an unprecedented trilateral initiative between Israel, Germany, and Kenya” that solved food and water insecurity issues for many thousands of people. The initiative stands as a testament to attempts at peace between formerly antagonistic peoples.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe theme of striving for peace carried through the next discussion on the Iran Nuclear Deal recently negotiated and passed by several nations including Iran, the United States, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, China, and others in the European Union. Notably, Israel was absent from negotiations and spoke out against the terms of the deal. Yaki explained that one of the problems Israel has is the lifting of decades-old economic sanctions on Iran that they feel may allow illegal materials into the country and eventually lead to Iran’s possession of a nuclear weapon. While the deal guarantees agreeing nations the right to inspect Iranian facilities for illegal materials, Israel feels this is not enough of a guardian against what they see as a seriously grave threat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"493\" data-orig-width=\"657\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c9d7d3b175c0f96246fd39f80d2c507c/tumblr_inline_ny57qkhACb1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"493\" data-orig-width=\"657\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eYaki pointed out that it is not an issue between Israelis and Iranians as citizens; there are many on both sides and outside these nations whose greatest desire is for peace and cooperation. It is to be noted that Iran’s new president, Hassan Rouhani, is touted as a moderate force unlike past leaders that verbally expressed desires for the end of a Jewish state. Yaki commented that such threats must be taken seriously, especially in light of real violence that is committed against Israel from its neighbors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom there the discussion turned to Palestine. Yaki made sure to correct the idea that Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu is against a two-state solution and, in fact, has for years showed support for such a plan. When asked if Israeli settlements are a major component holding back peace talks, Yaki expressed that he did not believe it was and the real concern is the violence against Israel and leading factions in Gaza and West Bank. Hamas, which has power in Gaza, declares in its founding documents it seeks the removal of the Jewish State. This fact, says Yaki, dismisses any claim that violence done in Gaza is by radical offshoots and not by Hamas itself. “From the river to the sea”, Yaki reminded us, is the rhetoric used in Palestine to express the sentiment of “wiping” Israel off the map. Throughout all this, the desire for the people of Israel and even for many in Palestine, is for peace; however Israel must keep the security of its citizens, which does include many Palestinians living within its borders, as first priority.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"493\" data-orig-width=\"657\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bd6918c0fab6047a00fb880887491598/tumblr_inline_ny57qtBdWZ1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"493\" data-orig-width=\"657\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo conclude the hour on a positive note, Yaki discussed Israel’s desalination developments and its ties to Southern California specifically. Among Israel’s security problems, it is also a small nation with little access to fresh water within its borders. For decades Israel has been funding development into technologies that can turn seawater from the Mediterranean into drinking water. As much as 80% of Israel’s drinking water now comes from these\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003edesalinization plants. California\u0026rsquo;s current mega-drought has put desalination in the spotlight as a possible solution to our water needs. Yaki spoke about the new plant in Carlsbad, north of San Diego, that has been designed by Israeli-based IDE Technologies. However, while Israel can meet the needs of its 8 million people with desalination, it will be a long time before the technology can be a viable long-term solution for California’s 55 million.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten by: \u003c/i\u003eJames DePaola\u003cbr/\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhotos by: \u003c/i\u003eTerry Hu\u003c/p\u003e",

While the post duo dominated the glass (UCLA won the rebounding battle, a historic weakness for them, 60-37 on Friday), Parker was a nightmare defending in space against Monmouth’s quicker forwards and Welsh made lethargic weakside help rotations that often resulted in drawn fouls and free throws for the Hawks.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile they had their moments attacking the basket and controlling the tempo, the freshman backcourt tandem of Aaron Holiday (brother of former UCLA Basketball and current New Orleans Pelican Jrue Holiday) and Prince Ali were largely underwhelming with a combined 17 points on 5-for-20 shooting. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHoliday, who got the starting nod, had a wide-open 3-point look from the right wing that could have tied the game at the end of overtime, but it clanged off the back iron as time expired.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the Bruins, who blew a 13-point lead in the second half and a 5-point lead in the overtime period, on top of allowing Monmouth to score all of their final nine points at the free throw line, they were understandably downtrodden about their subpar effort.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Our guard play was atrocious,” said head coach Steve Alford in his post-game interview.  “You don’t make free throws, you don’t make layups, you don’t handle the ball well, and then you don’t guard in the last 10, 15 minutes, it makes it hard on you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“From halftime on, I didn’t like how we guarded,” he continued.  “And for the entire 45 minutes, I couldn’t stand the way we took care of the ball.  We were really, really careless, and that falls on me.  I’ll take a responsibility of that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We gotta figure out how to get average, before we can take a step towards being good, because we’re bad right now.  And that’s a lot of credit to Monmouth.  They outplayed us in every area.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We couldn’t control the ball and a majority of that’s on me,” agreed Alford’s son Bryce, pinning the much of the blame on the Bruin guards as well. “We had guys running into each other, dribbling off our knees out of bounds, passing the ball to nobody.  I think a lot of it had to do with a lot of bad spacing.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGuards driving in and not being on two feet, not making grounded plays, smart plays.  It’s just unacceptable from start to finish.  All of our guards have gotta be better.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We know we gotta play better,” added Parker.  “We really turned the ball over a lot. Credit to them and their defense.  They did well with playing passing lanes and being more active than we were.  But 13 assists and 23 turnovers. That’s not the kind of team that we are.  Not at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe schedule doesn’t get any easier for the team from here. Dates with Pepperdine and UNLV beckon in the next eight days after Sunday’s step-forward victory over Cal Poly, so the Bruins will have to find their identity and their mojo quick before they dig themselves in too deep of a hole in the Pac-12 standings.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause after this kind of abominable loss to start the year, the Bruins’ season may already be on life support.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten by\u003c/i\u003e: Darryn Albert\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"658\" data-orig-height=\"658\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8a4aff60d6280d609e8c1c9bb40f1a39/tumblr_inline_nxq93bgG1g1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"658\" data-orig-height=\"658\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eFollowing the release of her new album, \u003ci\u003eArt Angels\u003c/i\u003e, Grimes tweeted, “there is so much beauty in music. I wish perceived commercial ambition was not the topic sometimes.” Of course, this can often become a mode of discourse when critiquing independent artists, whose “artistic authenticity” is linked with their relationship to the mainstream. \u003ci\u003eArt Angels\u003c/i\u003e is clearly a step into the realm of mainstream pop music, featuring production at its most glossy, robust, and extravagant for Grimes. Though this is a steep departure from 2012’s \u003ci\u003eVisions\u003c/i\u003e, it in no way shows a waning of her artistic authenticity. Grimes as a full-fledged, bizarro pop star is perhaps the most authentic version of Grimes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe album’s sound pulls inspiration from 90’s dance pop without bending to any sense of nostalgia. In fact, Grimes’ added experimentation and quirkiness keeps such reminiscent sounds fresh and surprising at moments. In “Kill V. Maim,” a deep, chugging guitar with punchy beats sets the foreground for Grimes’ animalistic yelps, which quickly transform into a peppy and demented cheerleader chant: “B-E-H-A-V-E aggressive!” The song is a prime example of how Grimes injects her oddball idiosyncrasies into pop-minded music, never letting the varnish of production dilute the personality of the songs. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe album version of “Realiti” provides a good point of comparison for Grimes’ growth as a producer. Whereas the demo release remained in an ethereal space, soaked with synth pulses, the new “Realiti” removes its shroud of reverb and haze and grounds itself with a heavier beat. In the intermediary time between these releases, it is as if Grimes has re-evaluated the actual realities of her music. On \u003ci\u003eArt Angels \u003c/i\u003eGrimes lets her voice stand out – with the occasional vocal manipulation of her yelp that recalls its use on \u003ci\u003eVisions\u003c/i\u003e – letting clarity co-exist with her emotive vocal style. At times the album seems like a love-letter to pop music, with tracks like “Belly of the Beat” and “Artangels” which revel in a heightened state of pop euphoria, where fantasy mingles into reality. At other times, tracks like “Flesh without Blood” and “Venus Fly” pose empowered affronts against the hierarchies that critique and delimit pop as mere kitsch, insisting that pop can have real meaning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGrimes wields her pop artillery with a clear and acute self-awareness through it all. In the closing track “Butterfly” she muses, “if you’re looking for your dream girl / I’ll never be your dream girl.” \u003ci\u003eArt Angels\u003c/i\u003e’ self-awareness is its hidden weapon. Her role as a pop musician is here indisputable. Any fan or critic dismissing \u003ci\u003eArt Angels\u003c/i\u003e for its “perceived commercial ambition” is relying on their own fantasized conception of what Grimes is. Though the “dream girl” doesn’t exist, there’s a real one who can do things even better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eReviewed by: \u003c/i\u003eDylan Karlsson\u003c/p\u003e",

For a man born in 1995, Joey commands an audience that practically all outnumber his age, like a religious savior.

Joey has kept his music authentic, experimental and raw, starting new trends and becoming a staple in modern hip-hop culture. Progressive Era, or Pro Era for short, is Joey’s Brooklyn hip-hop collective that is at the forefront of bringing old school style to new wave listeners, including housing Joey’s four mixtapes: “1999” (2012), “Rejex” (2012), “Summer Knights” (2013) and “B4.DA.$$” (2015). Joey’s latest tape is a monumental step in the right direction, epitomizing his lyrical verve and grabbing presence, to place him on top of the hip hop game. “It’s been a minute since they seen a style with no gimmicks,” off the Intro to Joey’s second mixtape, “Rejex.” Joey lives and breathes these words, evident in his entrance dripping in young blood swag, hailing himself as king. Sporting platformed kicks, ripped jeans, a black band tea barely legible under his draping gold chains and an army jacket, Joey commanded us he is here to stay.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1128\" data-orig-width=\"1504\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fa7023ae7587c91c7d565700c6448a36/tumblr_inline_nxhmruOQVt1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1128\" data-orig-width=\"1504\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThroughout the show, Joey threw off articles of clothing, in sync with the growing hype within the crowd. The verve transitioned in and out of trances during Joey’s slay of lyrics and mosh pits as Joey popped off. This sort of conversation between the energy of his audience and the sound waves in the air is a tribute to the original art of performance. Joey ended his show, bleeding beads of sweat, with a call for a moment of silence, with lighters in one hand and peace signs with the other, for loved ones who have fallen victims to police brutality and other atrocities. After 20 seconds of deep-breathed, sweaty silence, Joey directed the audience to turn their peace signs into middle fingers towards the police force. Joey then requested a “hyped mosh pit” and tore up his final lyrics, swooning in and out of acapella, for his final number.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWords by: \u003c/i\u003eBrittany Hewitt\u003cbr/\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhotos by: \u003c/i\u003eOlivia Lim\u003c/p\u003e",

We were all intrigued and suddenly realized that they were playing “Every Direction is North” from the album \u003ci\u003eEvery Direction is North\u003c/i\u003e. The synchronization and the the sheer trust they had in each other was prevalent and it made me smile.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/805a09e4daddd491db4a0db30bcd4e65/tumblr_nwll69KVMy1tumtu1o2_540.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9fdb91f8df33e240dde5eebc06b2fdbb/tumblr_inline_pk3h1mR9pw1sb9xwh_540.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-orig-height=\"720\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/805a09e4daddd491db4a0db30bcd4e65/tumblr_nwll69KVMy1tumtu1o2_540.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eTheir 80-minute set concluded with arguably their most famous song “Transitions” from their album \u003ci\u003eTransitions\u003c/i\u003e.

And much to my dismay, \u003ci\u003eWhat a Time to Be Alive \u003c/i\u003efeels as if it’s exactly that: another Future LP but with even more Drizzy features added to the mix.  But that being said, the inclusion of Drake definitely makes this project much more engaging than a standalone Future release.  The Toronto-native has definitely proven himself as having a much stronger handle on melodies and hooks\u0026ndash; assets that serve as a welcome antithesis to Future’s borderline redundant approach to his solo work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Drake hops on, he delivers his verses with the confidence that inevitably fills one’s spirit when your name is half the project. Future isn’t bad either; he comes forward with a distinctive personality, and his flow helps establish the aesthetic this mixtape is aiming for.  But speaking of tone, \u003ci\u003eWhat a Time\u003c/i\u003e’s production is reminiscent of the minimal and spacious feel from both \u003ci\u003eIf You’re Reading This, It’s Too Late\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eDS2\u003c/i\u003e, without truly establishing anything of its own sadly.  This project isn’t devoid of identity per se, but I can’t help but feel as if things were played dangerously safe.  After the opener, “Digital Dash,” you basically know what you’re getting for the duration of this thing: Drake and Future exchanging lines over carefully executed, and occasionally atmospheric beats that can go hard, albeit very conservatively.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter subsequent listens I start to get the sense that this project was a little thrown together too, and it was\u0026ndash; \u003ci\u003eWhat a Time\u003c/i\u003e was allegedly recorded during an impromptu six-day session.  The result is impressive on some levels, especially when tracks like “Diamonds Dancing” and “Jumpman” hit, but the spontaneity of the whole thing really starts to reveal itself with the amount of uninspired lyrics, or tracks such as “Jersey” that feel like throwaway cuts from \u003ci\u003eDS2\u003c/i\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s not to say that this project falls horribly short of an enjoyable listen during its forty-minute runtime, however.  Despite my complaints, nothing here is particularly awful; it’s just not filled with very many standouts either.  What you get just feels like the bare minimum from both of these artists, so I can’t help but feel like \u003ci\u003eWhat a Time to Be Alive \u003c/i\u003eis just a myriad of unexplored potential.  Like I said, Drake and Future possess the chemistry necessary for a solid collaborative effort, but the execution just doesn’t reach the effort of say, another Run the Jewels at this point.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWords by: \u003c/i\u003eDoug Gil\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b73724b6babc9f629afff7cb83db0cfa/tumblr_inline_nqps9mTGYv1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\nThe lights in the Observatory fade to black and a melancholic soft blue light illuminates the stage from behind. Silhouettes enter stage right and slowly settle into their instruments. They begin to craft a meditative, ambient wall of sound that washes over the audience like a plush blanket. An electric organ eases into its single long bass note before diving in completely; an organ softly murmurs in the background; a violin quietly weeps (or is it a moan?) above its counterparts; a rimshot acts as a heartbeat, maintaining the pace of the ebb and flow. Suddenly, another silhouette enters the stage and takes residence in front of the microphone while the band finally settles into the familiar, albeit slowed down, groove of “Open.” The crowd goes wild.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis moment is perhaps the best summary of Rhye’s musical practice: sleek, sensual, seductive, a little sad, and downright \u003ci\u003esexy\u003c/i\u003e. They take their time with every aspect of their sound, sliding into a melody precisely when it \u003ci\u003efeels \u003c/i\u003eright. Vocalist Mike Milosh unfurls his breathy coos over unobtrusive beats while sophisticated strings swell up from beneath him into a massive wave of emotion, only to fall back down at and settle into subtlety. The effect is infectious.\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe lead-up to Rhye’s excellent debut album, \u003ci\u003eWoman\u003c/i\u003e, was met with immense music blog hype. Initially, the duo, now revealed to be comprised of vocalist/producer Mike Milosh and Danish producer/songwriter Robin Hannibal of Quadron, shrouded their identities, releasing the tracks “Open” and “The Fall” with little accompanying description. But with its silky production and cleverly constructed lyrics about sex, love, heartbreak, and more sex, the music spoke for itself, and the internet went \u003ci\u003ewild\u003c/i\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite the hype, it’s nothing short of mind-blowing to think that something as patient and free-flowing as Rhye, music as deeply indebted to the sophisti-pop of acts like Sade and Avalon-era Roxy Music, would develop such a massive and dedicated following in 2015. Even more shocking is that \u003ci\u003eWoman \u003c/i\u003ewas released on Republic/Innovative Leisure/Loma Vista in 2013, and Rhye, the live-act, has been touring basically ever since.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\nGiven that their album spawned two years of successful touring to sold-out shows practically everywhere they went, my expectations for their live show were rather high. I was not disappointed in the slightest. \n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/546184c93357780d8a3f78d40f88bb64/tumblr_inline_nqps7vNuBb1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince Rhye only has 10 songs to their name, much of their performance at the Observatory was made up of reworked and extended versions of their catalog. They opened with a pared back version of already minimal cut “Open,” in which they honed in on the rhythmic guitar line in the recorded version and laid it down as the foundation of the groove for all instrumentation. It was an interesting flip, and one that worked in their favor, as it allowed Milosh to show off a funk-tinged, punchy vocal performance that was a refreshing change of pace from the atmospherics of their recorded work. Standout performances of “Last Dance” and “Hunger” turned into seemingly endless jam sessions not unlike the best of Maxwell or even D'angelo, transforming the songs into soulful, funky, almost psychedelic behemoths that grew and grew until they reached mind-bogglingly satisfying climaxes that left the audience in pure awe. What was most satisfying about those performances, though, and throughout the show in general, was that the band felt like a single unit, truly in tune with one another, not overpowering anyone else unless they were being showcased for their musical prowess.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the highlights of their set was their performance of new song, “Waste.” After all the online murmurs of Rhye being a one-album project, I was thrilled to hear new work from them, and hope this is an early promise of a new album on the horizon. The song, which he stated was “pulled together during soundcheck,” was more groove-based than the rest of their recorded work, and welcomed a few licks of preciously plucked xx-esque electric guitar into the Rhye texture. It’s definitely a promising track that sounds like it still may be in the early stages of its conception, but the magic is undeniably still there.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"4500\" data-orig-height=\"3000\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c64d58c9f2bd94c4d3cfefec6546bcc5/tumblr_inline_nqpsficSE71qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4500\" data-orig-height=\"3000\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor their closing song, Rhye performed one of Milosh’s solo tracks entitled “It’s Over.” With the directive to make us cry, as suggested by an audience member, Rhye delivered one of the most beautifully heart-wrenching vocal performances I’ve seen at a live show in recent memory. Beginning with subtle accompaniment, every member on stage eventually stepped away from their instruments and sang in perfectly pitched, multi-part harmony with Milosh. The performance successfully silenced the audience, and Rhye were able to slowly fade into murmurs before ending their song with, “Thank you.” I may regret saying this, but I may have shed a tear or two.\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat Rhye does may not be new or groundbreaking, but their music doesn’t need to be so. They are an act that’s equally as captivating recorded as they are live, and their streamlined sensuality is so perfectly constructed that it’s difficult to deny they’re more than the hype that surrounded them. Their performance at the Observatory is one that will probably stick with me for a while. It was a truly magical showcasing of expertly executed pop, soul, R\u0026amp;B, and funk that left me speechless. If you have the chance to see Rhye live, do not miss it; you will not be disappointed.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e~ Gabriel Brenner\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Show Review: Neutral Milk Hotel @ the Observatory (5/29/15)",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003eOn\n the road down to Santa Ana, my friend in the passenger seat of my car \nturned and said, “We are seeing a band perform an album that has always \nexisted in myth to me.” Neutral Milk Hotel returned in 2013 for their \nextended tour after nearly fifteen years of inactivity for what is \nconsidered to be their last time performing together. The band’s website\n reads, “Dear friends we love you but it’s time to say goodbye for the \nnever ending now to announce that spring 2015 will be our last tour for \nthe foreseeable future…”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen we arrived to the entrance of the \nObservatory, we were informed that we had to return our cellphones to \nour cars. The gratitude I felt from being liberated from staring through\n cellphone screens the entire show cannot be understated. I now \nunderstood the show would become more of a moment. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Jeff \nMangum ushered the band out playing A Baby for Pree, I could feel the \ncrowd holding their collective breath. It wasn’t until Neutral Milk’s \nthird song, The King of Carrot Flowers, proclaiming, “When you were \nyoung,” that patrons who have all waited so long to see this band \nperform erupted into whimsical hysteria. The mosh of Holland, 1945 \ncatapulted me to the front of the crowd, where I would stay for the \nremainder of the show (thirteen or fourteen more songs). Being able to \nsee the quirky and cute Julian Koster play his bass adorned with \nsnowflakes and three different musical saws for songs like Ghost was a \nbeautiful manifestation of the band’s truly unique sound. The longer \nNeutral Milk played, the more entranced I felt in Mangum’s soft, cold \nvoice. Even drummer Jeremy Barnes, the coolest of cats, took a turn \nplaying the accordion. The show was more of a going-away party than a \nperformance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Mangum played the simple chord progressions of \nTwo-Headed Boy, Part Two to close the four-song encore, I was reminded \nwhy I love Neutral Milk Hotel so much: they still care about the music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e~ \u003ci\u003eChase Bishov\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Though their name has gathered popularity within the underground, their rise to prominence is one that is barely documented, and it is not until they are at their heightened positions that they are seen in a different light.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, with Lil Skies, this seems not to be the case. On the contrary, his journey is one that has seen significant coverage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy exposure with Lil Skies began via a Cufboys YouTube video towards the beginning of June, one in which he was only present for a solid 45 seconds. However, it was through Cufboys’ Cameron Haller’s decision to incorporate Lil Skies’ songs as intro music that I was able to discover more of his work. And sure enough, not long after he made his appearance, he released the single “Red Roses” with Landon Cube, one of his biggest charting singles to date. From there, Lil Skies has seemingly erupted as rap’s next star, releasing songs that encompass strong melodies, lively cadences, and energetic production. Alongside support from established brands like Lyrical Lemonade and No Jumper, Lil Skies has seen his strong home following grow into a country wide one that has allowed him to play shows that have only grown larger and larger in size. His popularity has seen him on websites and blogs like Genius, Pigeons and Planes, HotNewHipHop, and a plethora of others.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith momentum from his debut single alongside his latest release “Nowadays,” also with Cube, as well as a few complimentary visuals, Lil Skies released \u003ci\u003eLife Of A Dark Rose\u003c/i\u003e at the top of the new year, a project that fully utilizes everything that he does well, but does not offer much insight into who Lil Skies is as an artist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe project starts off with a strong opener entitled “Welcome To The Rodeo,” a Taz Taylor produced track that shows Lil Skies’ ability to rap and articulate his story. With production that mirrors Travis’ Scott “Antidote” if it were to take place in an alternate universe, Skies talks about his come up as a young artist. Talking about some of his hardships, like selling drugs to book studio time and some motivation in his actions (”I got tattoos on my face, I use that shit as motivation/I could never get a job, so for my dream, I\u0026rsquo;m dedicated”), Skies offers something different from an assortment of other artists - insight into his perspective. In an attempt to differentiate himself from other rappers (”All these rappers want the clout and the life of bein\u0026rsquo; famous/I just wanna be stable, tell my family we made it”), Skies draws me in as a listener here but sadly does not maintain this throughout the duration of his album.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFollowing the strong opener is the album’s second track “The Clique,” a song that takes immense influence from Playboi Carti and Lil Uzi Vert but offers nothing different than what those two artists have already done. Produced by frequent Lil Uzi collaborator Maaly Raw, Skies announces his allegiance to the ones that he came up with while dismissing those who don’t have his best intentions. While the subject matter of the song is one that doesn’t necessarily break new ground, the track suffers musically through a slow tempo and lack of originality in regards to cadences and rhyme patterns. It is a huge drop off from the album’s strong opener, and a little disappointing at that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFollowing is the breakout single “Red Roses,” as well as another single entitled “Lust.” To me, this is where Lil Skies thrives, especially in regards to the new age of hip hop we currently live in. Produced by Menoh Beats and CashMoneyAP respectively, both songs have a hypnotic quality that lends itself to the tempo that each song possesses. With “Red Roses,” Skies slightly changes his manner of delivery through the engineering of the record but keeps his pacing consistent throughout, leaving room for Cube to seemingly steal the show. A talented artist in his own right, Cube’s vocals reign supreme on this track as well as the album’s closer “Nowadays,” bringing a commercial quality that might not have been present had he not been on either song. Though both songs don’t necessarily rely on Cube, they most definitely find their full potential due to his contributions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs opposed to “Red Roses,” “Lust,” through its energy and liveliness, shines as one of the best tracks on the album. “Lust” encompasses all that is good with today’s rap in my opinion, from its fun, upbeat production to Skies’ singing on the record, and even his rapping as well. The record is easily digestible, which makes it great to play around friends or in a car, or whenever the moment is opportune. To me, it is a song with immense potential and it continues to grow as a favorite, even months after its release.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough most of the songs on this record lack the diversity of three of the first four songs on the record, when Skies applies his formula to records precisely and incorporates his own style, it still works effectively. Songs like “Cloudy Skies,” “Signs of Jealousy,” and “Lettuce Sandwich” work because they go off of what Skies knows thus far and try something a little different. “Cloudy Skies,” produced by Ghxst, sees Skies using an entirely different approach that consists of him singing for the most part over a Silversun Pickups’ “Lazy Eye” sample. Though subject matter is no different than any of the other tracks, it is through Lil Skies’ attempts to try something different that this track immediately sticks out and works for me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the contrary, when Lil Skies makes records that borrow from his contemporaries, his attempts can often times come off as lazy and uninspired. On records like “Big Money,” “Boss Up,” and “Strictly Business,” Skies either blatantly reiterates on a cadence that he has already used (“Strictly Business” sounds like a lazier “Red Roses”) or relies on the subject matter to carry him. However, when a 14 track album has repeated themes and concepts, there is only so much that one can listen to before growing tired and weary of the music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo me, Lil Skies has much room to grow as an artist. However, considering that this is his first major release, he shows flashes of maintaining longevity in the music industry, through infectious melodies and incredible live energy. Though I am not one to consistently play this type of music in my own personal life, I understand that there is a place for all music, and Lil Skies has done a great job of etching his own place in today’s musical landscape. Furthermore, being the age that he is (19), Skies has put forth a decent effort that will only be fine tuned from this point moving forward, and I cannot wait for his next release as a result.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eFavorite Tracks:\u003c/b\u003e “Welcome To The Rodeo,” “Red Roses (feat. Landon Cube),” “Lust,” “Cloudy Skies,” and “Nowadays (feat. Landon Cube)”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWorst Track: \u003c/b\u003e“The Clique”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eOverall Score:\u003c/b\u003e 6/10  \u003c/p\u003e",

What drew you to Austin in terms of the music scene? It seems like if you\u0026rsquo;re from LA, that might be the place to be.\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMolly: \u003c/b\u003eYeah, well I grew up in LA and moved away after I graduated high school. I spent a year in New York. I went to Sarah Lawrence College for a year, then I transferred to Asheville to study music there. It was a really wonderful community and place, but it was a little small at the time. After I graduated I wanted something bigger, but I wanted something more manageable than LA, I think. I think I was a little scared to go back to LA and Austin just seemed like a safer choice at the time. It was an exciting new adventure, because I\u0026rsquo;d never really been there before. It pushed me to go out of my comfort zone, but it was also, I think, probably easier than moving back to LA. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eClea:\u003c/b\u003e Did you have any family or connections in the (Austin) area or did you just pick up and go to Austin?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMolly:\u003c/b\u003e I kind of just picked up and went. I have family in Dallas so that\u0026rsquo;s always, that\u0026rsquo;s been really nice to have close family. Other than that, in Austin, I rushed into a relationship so I had a boyfriend, but other than him I didn\u0026rsquo;t know anyone who lived there. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eClea:\u003c/b\u003e What was your process for writing this album, it sounds like a lot of it is autobiographical about your relationship. So, was the writing process also one of healing from the end of a relationship or, what did it look like?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMolly:\u003c/b\u003e Yeah, it definitely was..Before I moved to Austin I didn\u0026rsquo;t really write too much, I was sort of scared to start writing my own music, but when I came to Austin and I was sort of by myself, it kind of just pushed me to come out of my comfort zone. I was dealing with a break up at the time, I had left my boyfriend in Asheville and then jumped into a new relationship. So, a lot of it is about that and then in the middle of writing the album I got back together with him. So some of the songs are about that as well. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eClea: \u003c/b\u003eHow would you describe your musical style? I\u0026rsquo;ve read that you studied jazz music in Asheville is that correct? You\u0026rsquo;re sound is similar to Patsy Cline and Billie Holiday, and from listening to you, I would agree, but there\u0026rsquo;s something different about your music. How would you describe that difference?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMolly: \u003c/b\u003eOh thanks, yeah. Well, I studied jazz in college. And I did vocal performance and grew up listening to jazz. But I also grew up listening to pop music and R\u0026amp;B and I think I\u0026rsquo;ve always just been really influenced by voices and that\u0026rsquo;s my main instrument, so I think I just like followed what made sense for my voice. I definitely have a lot of jazz influences, and I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I think it’s just like a mix-up of everything that I listened to as a kid and studied in college. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eClea:\u003c/b\u003e Are there any experiences that you think have most informed either your writing style or your musical style in terms of singing?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMolly: \u003c/b\u003eYeah, I guess, like well definitely going to college for jazz and performance that really helped me get comfortable with singing and performing in front of people. Growing up, my sister was a big influence for me because I was too shy to pursue singing, or anything. It seemed like it was a crazy concept so she really pushed me to do it. And yeah, I think really moving to Austin\u0026hellip;That was another big thing in my life that really pushed me to dedicate my time to music. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eClea:\u003c/b\u003e You\u0026rsquo;d mentioned that at first you were really just singing and I\u0026rsquo;d read that on your website, but um that you didn\u0026rsquo;t do any songwriting because you were afraid. So I guess, where was that fear coming from or, what was holding you back from dabbling in songwriting?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMolly:\u003c/b\u003e I think just, just being insecure and not having the confidence. It just seemed, I don\u0026rsquo;t know I just had a such a block; I felt like I didn\u0026rsquo;t even want to try because I felt like I was just afraid to look stupid, or I don\u0026rsquo;t know it was really just insecurities. And it took me a long time to even just be comfortable with singing or having, you know, i didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be so vulnerable in front of people and I think that just the more I did it\u0026hellip;and same goes for writing, once I pushed myself, and just the more that I did it the more comfortable it felt and the insecurities just go away, it\u0026rsquo;s just learning how to deal with insecurities in the process for sure. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eClea:\u003c/b\u003e You said that you didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be vulnerable, but having your music be so autobiographical and having talked about it being autobiographical do you ever feel that, you know, your personal feelings or your personal life are on display in a way that you don\u0026rsquo;t want them to be or has it been something that you\u0026rsquo;ve embraced in order to inform your music?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMolly: \u003c/b\u003eI think that, yeah, its definitely been something I\u0026rsquo;ve embraced. You know, i\u0026quot;m at a point where I am comfortable performing and more comfortable writing I don\u0026rsquo;t know, yeah, I\u0026rsquo;ve totally embraced it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eClea: \u003c/b\u003eSo, you\u0026rsquo;ve lived in three very different places I would assume for musical sounds, is there any one that, or I guess could you just describe the different music scenes and your experience of them in the 3 different places that you\u0026rsquo;ve mainly lived, like LA, Austin, and Asheville and maybe even New York too, if you\u0026rsquo;ve also lived there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMolly:\u003c/b\u003e I don\u0026rsquo;t have much experience really in LA or New York, cause New York I was living like upstate. I really only know Asheville and Austin and even Asheville has changed so much since I left `so I don\u0026rsquo;t feel like I could talk about it, but when I lived there I was in college, I had like a college band and it was pretty easy to play out and it was a really, really like small community so I think that was a nice introduction to being in a band. We did a lot of house shows, people were really supportive and super nice. and I love going back there. And Austin, has been it reminds me of Asheville in a lot of ways, it\u0026rsquo;s just bigger. It\u0026rsquo;s been super supportive and I feel like quite easy to\u0026hellip;When I first started playing shows it was pretty easy to get shows and I feel like its a pretty supportive community, I like it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eClea: \u003c/b\u003eYou mentioned that you were in a college band, what was the sound of that band or how did it differ from what you\u0026rsquo;re doing now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMolly:\u003c/b\u003e Ummm. It was kind of like a folk band, um, I don\u0026rsquo;t know it was me and my three other friends at the time and we all had like really no experience playing in bands and we would write songs together, like in the same room, it was pretty sweet. I think it was a good thing for me to have just some experience, I\u0026rsquo;m glad I had that before moving to Austin and really doing it on my own. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eClea:\u003c/b\u003e This last year for you has been kind of a whirlwind it sounds like from what I\u0026rsquo;ve been reading, with releasing your album and touring nationally and internationally, is that right? I guess, what\u0026rsquo;s been your biggest take away or lesson learned about the music industry, or yourself, or really anything?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMolly:\u003c/b\u003e Umm, I think yeah, this year\u0026rsquo;s been really wonderful I didn\u0026rsquo;t, I don\u0026rsquo;t know it\u0026rsquo;s just been a lot of new experiences. When I recorded the album I had no idea that it would be, I hoped it would be able, I would find someone to release it, you know I didn\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;d be able to do that at the time and um, so yeah, just putting it out that was such an accomplishment for me and then I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect to tour so much, but it was definitely a good amount and I learned a lot about being a band leader and just about touring in general. It\u0026rsquo;s been really wonderful, but then you know a lot of difficult things along the way I\u0026rsquo;ve learned so much this year, so I think it was a pretty great year for lessons. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eClea: \u003c/b\u003eWhat\u0026rsquo;s it been like to have your music take off so quickly and with such positive response, were you expecting it or are there drawbacks to all the attention or expectations people have for you or has it mostly been a positive, gratifying experience?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMolly:\u003c/b\u003e I think its mostly been positive, I think its hard to see clearly sometimes with like how it\u0026rsquo;s being received, I guess. And I also don\u0026rsquo;t like to think about it too much, but I feel overall really positive about it and I feel really grateful just with everything, just I\u0026rsquo;m grateful I got to release an album I’m grateful that I have a really supportive label and I feel happy about how it was received. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eClea: \u003c/b\u003eAre you working on anything new right now or have you just been focusing on the album and touring it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMolly:\u003c/b\u003e Yeah, well we have another tour coming up, we\u0026rsquo;re going to LA, we\u0026rsquo;re going to be supporting Alex Cameron on tour and, but yeah, definitely I\u0026rsquo;m working on new stuff. I feel like pretty done with focusing on the last album, but I\u0026rsquo;m glad that we could have another tour with and maybe another tour in the spring. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eClea:\u003c/b\u003e Is the new stuff also autobiographical, are you kind of moving away from that, if you had to describe it or if you can describe it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMolly: \u003c/b\u003eSure, yeah, I think that its um, definitely, still very personal..It’s just not so much about love, I think, you know.. There are some songs like that, but it’s.. I think the more personal songs are about self-reflection and self-growth, yeah. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eClea:\u003c/b\u003e What\u0026rsquo;s been your favorite show that you\u0026rsquo;ve played? Either the venue or the audience or whoever you were playing with? What\u0026rsquo;s been the coolest experience you\u0026rsquo;ve had performing?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMolly:\u003c/b\u003e I guess one of the coolest most recently is we opened up for Grizzly Bear in Austin and that show was really special cause it as ??????? and that felt cool that felt like Austin pride. I think the other great show was our record release in New York. Last Feb, it seemed like the most exciting show because it was so full of nerves and just the excitement of the album coming out. And it was the first time we\u0026rsquo;d played for our label, so that was exciting. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eClea: \u003c/b\u003eI was reading some interviews with you from earlier in the year, from right after your album had dropped and it said that you hadn\u0026rsquo;t yet played in LA. So, I guess now you probably have played in LA quite a bit more, and will be playing here again\u0026hellip;What\u0026rsquo;s it like to be playing in the city where you grew up?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMolly:\u003c/b\u003e So yeah we played in LA just one time and it was like yeah, it was like the most nervous I\u0026rsquo;d been all year probably just because. I don\u0026rsquo;t know it should feel the opposite, because its like all your friends and family. I think that was, i don\u0026rsquo;t know, it was awesome.. I love coming to LA it was a really nice show, but it was, I was so nervous I like wanted to throw up I was so scared. You know, it was just so many people that you grew up with and my favorite teacher from high school came, but the more people I know, the more nervous I get, but it was nice. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eClea:\u003c/b\u003e Will they all be there again for the show with Alex Cameron?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMolly: \u003c/b\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t know, some people \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eClea: \u003c/b\u003eAre you excited for it then?

    "title": "21 Savage @ The Conga Room (2/15/18) // Show Review",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten by Skyler Mizokami \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first thing I noticed when I entered the Conga Room late on a Thursday night was the intimacy of the venue. Quite literally a room, the place is made up of simply a couple of cocktail bars and a stage, with a small area for the crowd. This increased my excitement for the show, as 21 Savage would be only a few feet away when performing. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe event was put on by KJLH, so accordingly, the DJ sets were solid. The opener for 21 was Mike Free, a producer and songwriter from LA who is responsible for the Big Sean banger “I Don’t Fuck With You.” Free provided vocals, while the DJ played some of the songs that Free has produced. The music was good and the crowd was moving, but the overall energy of the venue was still low. Free himself seemed anxious for 21 Savage to take the stage. The DJ had to convince him to stay on for few more songs, as Free was ready to hand the mic over.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter Mike Free left the stage, the DJ announced 21 Savage. “Bank Account” started to play, and I was ready to jump around. 21 came out rapping with energy, and almost everybody in the small crowd took out their phones to record. “Bank Account” is a great song to hear live with its booming bass and catchy hook, but as I looked around barely anybody was actually dancing. A worrying sign. Next up he played his song “Rockstar,” another of his more popular songs, and again, there was not much energy in the crowd. I started to think of the songs that I wanted to hear from him, such as “Bad Business,” “Thug Life,” and “Rap Saved Me.” However, these hopes were never made a reality. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter just two songs, 21 Savage jumped off the stage without warning. The DJ began playing songs that weren’t 21’s, and I stood there confused with the rest of the crowd. It took awhile for me to really believe it, but 21 Savage truly performed only two songs and was on stage for less than ten minutes. My initial anticipation and excitement turned to disappointment. The crowd was partially to blame for the short performance, as I felt like one of five people who were actually dancing and singing along to the music. This was in high contrast to 21’s performance at Day n Night Music Festival, where the sea of people turned into one gigantic mosh pit. It seems that 21 Savage is a rapper who thrives in large crowds, rather than smaller venues like the Conga Room.\u003c/p\u003e",

The Queen Mary in Long Beach was home to the people who attended The Annual One Love Cali Festival, presented by The Observatory February 10 and 11, 2018.\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI felt so calm and at ease when waiting in line. It didn’t take long to get into the festival both days, which made me wonder if it was due to the festival not selling out, which meant that less people were the cause to the the festival’s easy entry. I picked up a penny that was heads up on my way into the venue that I saw shining on the floor, and was thankfuI I had the agency of not “waiting in a long line” for the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3072\" data-orig-width=\"1695\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/020f6ee4659ec35449f94314d440c4f2/tumblr_inline_p4qsrk6ap11qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3072\" data-orig-width=\"1695\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eLong Beach is home to the cutest couples and nicest people. Being a Long Beach native, it was a form of medicine being around people of color and familiar auras I grew up surrounded with. The love at One Love was overwhelmingly admirable. Couples were folded into each other\u0026rsquo;s arms and bodies like DNA chromosomes; perfectly fitting and aesthetically pleasing. The ground was littered with people who wouldn’t stop kissing, dancing, or drinking. The crowd at One Love was more of an older one, with the lengthy beer tent lines being one of the many indicators. My friend and I had been approached by many kind people throughout the weekend; with either genuine compliments or friendly conversation. A guy named Skittles asked us for a lighter, so we handed him my lucky yellow paisley one I had tucked in my back pocket, not knowing we would be spending the next hour talking life, people, and colors with Skittles. Another girl, Loni, saw me snapping photos of some people, when she tapped us on the shoulder and said, “I have to take a picture of you too.” Before she left us with her Instagram that I asked for (this is how I like to get to know people), she gave us the nickname “Baby Dolls” for the weekend. Watching Iration from the back of the venue Sunday night, this really nice guy named Jacob, approached us with a smile with the following words, “I see you girls just standing here while everyone is smoking, do you want to hit this?” Observing my audience and environment all weekend, I noticed the sea of people whose bodies were enclosed in their own constant handmade clouds of white smoke; a color that could have easily been mistaken as their aura. We finished dancing to the rest of Iration’s set, getting to know our new friend in between Iration’s many jams. It was nice being around a sharing energy this whole weekend, seeing everyone smoking each other out. That was the major vibe of One Love. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdvertised heavily throughout the weekend were vapes. The same AD lit the screen in between sets; a girl of color in a beanie, smoking an e-cig. This advertisement began to make sense when I looked around, and noticed that half of the smoke in the air, pervading its way to hug the clouds, was due to the excessive use of vapes and e-cigs, not just marijuana. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"2013\" data-orig-width=\"1719\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b750b0a7df81f80a6107df967d5f285f/tumblr_inline_p4qss4LkNA1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"2013\" data-orig-width=\"1719\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eFortunate Youth was the first performance I saw at the festival. With the band jumping around the stage, happy to be in this space together, I felt the day start off really well. At the end of their set, they lit big joints, taking a few hits among themselves on stage, then proceeding to offer it down to the crowd of photographers and to the sea of people we call crowds. A woman who looked about the age of my grandmother, took a couple long hits before handing it off to someone behind her. This was the movie scene I remember distinctly all weekend, because it was wholeheartedly the best part. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ Boog and his band lit the stage with their presence. His facial expressions while singing were juxtaposed with the grace of his voice. Playing, of course, his familiar hit “Let’s Do It Again,” he sadly did not play “Ganja Farmer,” subtly breaking my expectations. His band had the perfect energy and radiance that matched his music and stage performance; fitting together like puzzle pieces on a good day. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe front of the festival consisted mostly of the people smoking mary jane, standing shoulder to shoulder, swaying in the Long Beach breeze. The people that were drinking a lot were the ones who usually set up camp with their blankets and friends/family/lovers; wanting to dance all night in a space they created and called their own for a day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIration and Matisyahu played the main stage, both Saturday and Sunday. I had never been to a music festival where this was ever a thing, so it was interesting to see it unfold; I liked it because I admire both of these artists a lot. Iration’s set was predictable, but comforting. What suprise can a band have when all their songs are good? Matisyahu’s energetic stage presence held the crowd together like peanut butter and jelly. He hopped around stage in green pants, colorful shoes, and hair white as snow. It was a beautiful and youthful presentation of a being, and his musical performance molded him into a genuinely charismatic moving statue the audience could remember.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3075\" data-orig-width=\"5183\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/54c3209cf7761aa6aa8c5cda8276096f/tumblr_inline_p4qsspzOkg1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3075\" data-orig-width=\"5183\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAtmosphere played his familiar old tunes, giving the crowd the comfort they wanted to hear. His spin on “The Best Day” included him freestyling half the song, throwing in words like “Long Beach” and “palm trees,” so the audience could relate in the moment. Towards the end of his performance, Slug chanted to the crowd, with his spirit exposed, at the end of probably the greatest song in rap history, “Yesterday,” and said, “It might seem weird but do me a favor and make some noise for everybody that ain’t here.” It was the best performance of the weekend, and it was only the end of Day 1. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRebelution followed Atmosphere’s performance, closing out the main stage. Hand in hand, people in the back of the venue were now singing together in lucid states; the moon had rose fast, and it was now really late. Rebelution played some local favorites, “Feeling Alright,” “Count Me In,” and “Ordinary Girl,” closing off the night with their upbeat and resonating sounds. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWatching Common Kings was an amazing decision. They interacted with the crowd and each other in the same loving way. They played their familiar “Wade In Your Water” and “Alcoholic,” the two songs my friend introduced me to. The lead singer, at the end of a song, encouraged the crowd to hold up their flashlights on their phones as lighters - an act of establishing community and nostalgia together in this day and age of 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe beginning of Day 2, I accidentally napped during Stick Figure, dozing in and out, because the sun was just right. I was swinging my feet to the familiar beat when they decided to unconsciously wake me up by jamming to my favorite tune of theirs, “Smoking Love.” I wish there was a way I could have thanked them for the perfect timing. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLandon Mcnamara played the Flav Stage Sunday, playing all his new music from his latest album, \u003ci\u003eA Dollar Short and a Minute Late\u003c/i\u003e. With a familiar ball bouncing back and forth between the crowd, Landon was laying down powerful words and verses with grace; matching the rhythm of the sun setting in the background. Grabbing the crowd with his single “Loss for words,” the crowd was singing along, waving fingers in the air, trying to catch hold of this beautifully written empathetic song.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4334\" data-orig-width=\"3456\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1ca3ed33df8e81581a5a727c80e70fad/tumblr_inline_p4qst3pv3W1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4334\" data-orig-width=\"3456\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eI had never, before the night of February 11, heard Ben Harper before. After his performance, I was overwhelmingly glad that this was the first time I had experienced him and his band. Sometimes, solos can be dreadfully long and get to a point where you feel guilty for just wanting the chorus to come back, but Harper and his band killed the stage with their solos. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t take my eyes off of Leon Mobley’s (percussionist and drummer for Harper) beautifully curated solo. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was front row when Nas closed the stage out on Sunday. It was painfully ironic to watch him perform “If I Ruled The World,” when at the same exact moment, the queen Lauryn Hill herself, was at The Observatory in Santa Ana. Why was she there and not helping headline down here for us in Long Beach? We’ll just have to leave that up to corporate, seeing that it just wasn\u0026rsquo;t meant for us. When “The World is Yours” came on, my millennial film loving self immediately pictured the scenes from \u003ci\u003eDope\u003c/i\u003e, an amazing film about black youth that Nas is featured on. He was dressed warm in dark colors, rapping to an audience who looked like they were staring at a god the whole set. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne Love Cali Reggae Fest was a cumulation of 90s Long Beach nostalgia, a spreading of good energy among people, and a space that established itself with serenity and ease. It was an environment for people to come together and legally smoke marijuana among relaxing and comforting music that genuinely bled yellow and warmth.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"787\" data-orig-width=\"1400\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0a6ce6449224babe03afee620dd04291/tumblr_inline_p4jcc11xmS1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"787\" data-orig-width=\"1400\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten by Sophie Taylor \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Nightshift,” the single off Lucy Dacus’ up and coming album\u003ci\u003e Historian\u003c/i\u003e, is a dynamic departure from your typical tale of heartbreak. It starts off with soft, solitary strumming, invoking the fragility and vulnerability that comes with a freshly broken heart. Her crystalline voice cuts through the staccato strumming like a dagger, each phrase driving that blade just a little further into your already bleeding heart: “ The first time I tasted somebody else’s spit, I had a coughing fit//I mistakenly called them by your name.”  Around the two minute mark the band joins in, vanquishing the vulnerability felt in the previous section and molding the melancholy mood into a more uplifting one. Dacus’ vocals begin to escalate, transforming conflict into conviction: “You don’t deserve what you don’t respect// you don’t deserve what you say you love and then neglect.” Nearly four minutes in, the band gives out and her voice pierces the gentle guitar chords once again, no longer fragile, but solid and earthy. From here to the end of the over six minute long track, she builds upon this simple and strong verse, belting it over and over again, gaining ferocity with every repetition, climaxing in a celebration of personal growth and inner strength. At its finish, the song manages to leave you with a feeling of wholeness that only comes from years of growth and healing in the wake of heartbreak. The song can seem a bit incongruent at times, almost like three completely different tunes, as opposed to your typical verse-chorus-verse-chorus structure. I’m not gonna lie, it threw me off at first; it wasn’t the comforting repetition I was so used to, I was uneasy not knowing where it would go next. But that’s when I realized that’s what made this song so beautifully composed—growth isn’t comfortable, predictable, or linear either. It replicated the imperfectly human experience of growth, a tough-to-tackle concept that she executed boldly and beautifully, leaving me absolutely breathless.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D0WDZdT04ls4\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0WDZdT04ls4?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

Written with his youngest son in mind, the EP can be regarded as a thoughtful piece of parental advice, but also doubles as a call to preserve your inner child as long as you can, which is particularly relevant for those of us leaving college, and with it our childhood, as we get ready to enter the real world.\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe opening track, “Show Me the Sun,” is an up-tempo groove—complete with psychedelic interlude—that manages to capture the carefree essence of youth. There is a certain sweetness to their voices that places you in a world tinted with warm summer sunshine, forever suspending listeners in the joy and freedom of summertime youth. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf “Show Me the Sun” radiates summer spontaneity, “The Same Star” represents the explosive, irrational love that accompanies it. The funky beat is a poignant testimony to the reckless and self-destructive nature of young love: “Feeling blue, and I\u0026rsquo;ll do it again/In orbit ‘round the same star ‘till we fall apart.” The cosmic imagery is a perfect metaphor for the inescapable gravity love can have, as well as its often violent and messy end, a feeling that can be painfully familiar for some of us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The Same Star” is followed by easily the most sentimental song on the album, “I’ll Be Your Pilot.” The clean, clear vocals, pared down composition, and charming melody mirror all the purity and innocence a father admires as he watches his child drift into slumber. Cherishing this ephemeral innocence, he recognizes the challenges of growing up and urges his son to resist the pressures to conform to a rapidly maturing society as long as he can: “It’s tough to become a grown up, put if off while you can/When you land in the real world, it’s like quicksand.” However, I think this song simultaneously entreats us to cherish and preserve our inner child as we grow up, a much needed reminder for my fellow freshly blossoming adults.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Cornflakes” makes a complete 180 degree turn, with its slight dissonance and loose structure, allowing our hearts to rest a bit before segueing into the final track, “A Plague on Other Boys” - yet another painfully relatable tale of young love. It tells the tale of a student who is crushing hard on a fellow classmate, something all of us may have experienced first-hand. However, this student falls just a little too hard for this girl, losing himself in a passionate fantasy: “They say how can you know love, you\u0026rsquo;re a minor/And you say what else could I know, this defines me.” Spoiler alert: his fantasy is ultimately shattered by a cold, hard, reality, and he’s left picking up the pieces. While the protagonist finally got over the heartbreak and moved on, Belle \u0026amp; Sebastian point out that, “There’s a roped up part of every human heart for the first one you love,” a line that somehow left my heart both broken and full of hope, a perfect ending to an album about the complicated relationship between youth and adulthood.\u003c/p\u003e",

Their performance in New York was greeted with an unbearable apathy that obstructed my own enjoyment as I struggled to dance among an inanimate crowd of darkwave scenesters, who were awfully concerned with maintaining a veneer of composure throughout the entire show. All I wanted was to transform into my little-Russian-techno-boy persona (image below) but that desire was tragically repressed once I was told to “calm down” by multiple people around me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1311\" data-orig-width=\"1761\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/34508a95a0d8a2fb748ec4daaf03c074/tumblr_inline_p3soi7PYzv1qhakxc_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1311\" data-orig-width=\"1761\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs soon as I walked into the Echoplex and bumped shoulders with the darkwave mob in what felt like every direction, memories of my disappointment in New York began to resurface and filled me with an agonizing dread when I thought about having to deal with another passive audience in the face of my biggest musical influence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoy Harsher went on at 11 pm, with frontwoman Jae Matthews slowly emerging from stage right into a cloud of red mist, delicately moaning and breathing into the mic with a demonic appetite. Her echoing vocals permeated the atmosphere and were followed by an ardent wave of static noise that paralyzed the body with its lurid vibrations, hypnotically easing the mind into a deafening reverie infused with disorientation and the purest ecstasy imaginable. This prolonged trance was then forcefully intercepted by an icy drone and a burst of minimal synth, subsequently overpowered by the mesmeric drum beat from “Yr Body is Nothing,” which is the song that very much inspired me to make music. The crowd screamed with an air of pleasure, and in an instant, I and many others rushed to the center of the pit to dance undisturbed. Surrounded by strangers who expressed the same uncontrollable hysteria, I was able to release every bit of tension that had been growing inside of me. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMatthews sang the lines, “What do you want from me? What can I give you?” with a melancholic tone drowned in ghostly reverb, which contrasted the sensuous and captivating nature of the instrumentals coming from Augustus Muller’s end, ultimately creating a sound that simulated the emotional state of ambivalence. The duo’s live rendition of the song captured the impotent despair that their music is evocative of, and they harmoniously fused this emotive quality with feelings of vehement obsession and desire through the seductive reverberations of dark industrial techno. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike any other electronic artist I have seen live, Boy Harsher beautifully incorporates the art of storytelling into their music through the use of a personal narrative form that goes beyond the creation of stylistic effects. Even though their lyrics are manipulated by means of repetition and simplification in order to blend with the instrumentals, they do not suffer from methods of abstraction that complicate the modes of communication. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThroughout the performance, Matthews exhibited a powerful stage presence that actively engaged the audience by drawing attention to her gestures and motions that aided in the narration of the lyrics. Instead of losing myself in the instrumentals when “Pain” came on, I was completely drawn to the theatricality of the performance and the manner in which Matthews delivered the relatable story of being invisible to the person you desire the most. All in all, Boy Harsher exceeded my expectations and provided me with a much needed transcendental experience that was cathartic to the highest degree.  I was able to mercilessly dance for two hours non-stop in my dripping sweat without any repercussions, and in those moments I truly became the little-Russian-techno-boy that I have always wanted to be. Considering that the Echoplex was sold out and packed with dozens of people passing out left and right to the point where Boy Harsher had to pause their set, the LA crowd was pleasant to be around that night. The duo will be returning to the West Coast in April to play a show with The Soft Moon in San Diego, and this is a tour that you will not want to miss!\u003c/p\u003e",

I had never felt like my community had been represented on mainstream films, much less a Disney film. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the theaters, I was disappointed when I saw that Disney had tactfully provided a \u003ci\u003eFrozen\u003c/i\u003e “short” that lasted upwards of 40 minutes. I was bored and felt a degree of detachment. I had come to see \u003ci\u003eCoco\u003c/i\u003e, not \u003ci\u003eFrozen\u003c/i\u003e. I sat there and glanced around, observing everyone at the theater. I just wanted to do anything that would distract me from the painfully boring short where the protagonist was attempting to define tradition. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe movie theater was filled with people of color, a large majority were Latinx. The beauty in the audience, I found, was in the age range. You had young kids of about five years old up to other people well into their fifties, and of course you couldn’t ignore the college-age demographic the room either. Regardless of age, we were all sharing an experience, we were all excited to witness Disney and Pixar’s first attempt at truly capturing and representing the Latinx experience on screen. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DzNCz4mQzfEI\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zNCz4mQzfEI?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eSimply put, I was impressed. Not only was the protagonist nuanced and relatable, the antagonist reminded me of Mexican idols such as Jorge Negrete and Pedro Infante. The attention to detail was mesmerizing, the world of the dead with its vivid, enchanting colors and shapes reminded me heavily of Tijuana and Mexico City.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat I really appreciated in the film, was how the family was matriarchal. The mujeres in the film were strong-willed and tenacious, but also flawed and human. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe depth of the story was heartwarming, and the message of the film truly described what Día de los Muertos represents to us. Our loved ones who have passed are forever with us in our memories - their real departure occurs only if we forget them. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, \u003ci\u003eCoco\u003c/i\u003e is a must-watch. I will warn you, you must have tissues when viewing because you will cry. The film was beautifully crafted and the emotional ride is simply lovely. \u003c/p\u003e",

Fear not. If you had a television set in your possession or in close enough proximity in 2009, you definitely did. “Rawnald Gregory” appeared in a popular Target commercial that promoted their nationwide pharmaceutical services. This song has gone on over the years to be featured in television shows such as 2012’s \u003ci\u003eWeeds\u003c/i\u003e and 2014’s \u003ci\u003eThe Blacklist\u003c/i\u003e and the 2014 feature film \u003ci\u003eTwo Night Stand\u003c/i\u003e. Regardless of whether you have heard the song or not (I’m still convinced that a majority of you guys have), this was the song that all the STRFKR fans were excited to hear live. Five minutes into the concert, this was not the case at all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009When STRFKR’s Josh Hodges confidently stepped foot on stage donning a hot pink wig and turtleneck long-sleeved dress alongside the rest of his band, a silence came over the audience for a brief five seconds before they erupted into clapping and cheering. A lot of concertgoers had no idea what to expect from the band. Many of them really did just want to hear “that one famous hit.” Then, without any introduction of some sorts, the band went straight into “Hungry Ghost,” going on to play songs from earlier albums like 2016’s \u003ci\u003eBeing No One, Going Nowhere.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3265\" data-orig-width=\"4898\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5a5946e819761149048ad75ddc7e8ed7/tumblr_inline_p6lbwpcTJI1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3265\" data-orig-width=\"4898\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile these were STRFKR’s less well-known tracks, everybody appreciated the band’s instrumental-heavy style. As I was listening, I turned back to see how the people directly behind me were taking all of this in. They were shuffling their feet back in forth, nodding their heads. As a wise friend once told me, “You know a band is failing to grab an audience’s attention when some of them have their phones out.” No phones whatsoever. If anything, people were digging these tracks and filming the band for their Instagram and Snapchat stories. As the band began playing some of their more mainstream hits, I began realizing how a majority of their songs covered the anxieties or simply just the concept of death and mortality. Due to the fact that their music generally tends to be on the upbeat and lively side, it could easily be dismissed that the songs’ actual subject matters are based on such topics. However, I was able to notice the trend through bassist and vocalist Keil Corcoran’s emotions throughout the show. Whether he was the one that took over the vocals during the show or gravitated towards the back when playing the drums, his emotions throughout the show were undeviating. Corcoran seemed to be conscious of what subject matter the songs tackled, channeling expressions of agony, pain and melancholy. This was what ultimately made me appreciate the band even more. In general, their songs take such an abstract concept and convert it into something accessible and enjoyable for everyone through cheerful sounds and beats.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3368\" data-orig-width=\"4569\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5fd950b7b2d16d0fd8aab419234fb3ec/tumblr_inline_p6lbx5a8hp1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3368\" data-orig-width=\"4569\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy the time the group began playing “Rawnald Gregory,” they absolutely had the audience in the palm of their hands. Once “that one famous hit” was being played, everybody was pleasantly taken aback, realizing that they were truly enjoying the other previous songs. However, that did not stop everybody from singing along and basically taking over the song. At one point, Hodges stopped singing, letting the audience sing for what seemed like the entire song. The audience was in sync, singing to the song as if they had practiced it all together before the concert. Nobody missed a beat. It demonstrated to me how brilliant the song was. While the song lyrics themselves are simple due to the fact that they are only five repeated lines with a slight variation, the song itself deals once again with a gloomy topic \u0026ndash; people slipping away. However, you couldn’t tell based on how excited people were to sing this song together. To say the least, I was even more in awe after they wrapped up the song. And to think that “Rawnald Gregory” would signify the concert’s peak\u0026hellip; boy, was I wrong. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3265\" data-orig-width=\"4898\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/01ca5fc42fcabaae45a1c50ddf5d034e/tumblr_inline_p6lbxreXlI1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3265\" data-orig-width=\"4898\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eImmediately after STRFKR wrapped up their famous hit, a dance party was unleashed. While playing songs like “Lazer Fight,” “Interspace,” and “Helium Muffin,” the band brought out dancers dressed in spacesuits and rabbit costumes. These dancers were killing it, interacting with both the performers and fans. People were snapping pictures left and right, going crazy and even getting up on stage to crowd surf with the dancers. Everybody, including myself, was banging on the stage and jumping like there was no tomorrow. When the band began playing their cover of Cyndi Lauper’s 1983 hit, “Girls Just Wanna Have Fun,” people were living. At that point, the audience was going crazy alongside the band and dancers. People were screaming the lyrics while hugging one another. As somebody who attends concerts frequently, I had never seen anything like it. Strangers were going up to one another, encouraging one another to go up on stage and jump into the arms of their fellow concertgoers. It was absolutely incredible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3265\" data-orig-width=\"4898\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed1e25b5ec4f6ccc72aef3590bfbb4ed/tumblr_inline_p6lbvofS6R1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3265\" data-orig-width=\"4898\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the band performed their last song, “Being No One, Going Nowhere,” everybody was still having the time of their lives, singing along and embracing one another. When the performers took their last bow with one another, they left the stage with a resounding “Encore” in back of them. The audience did not have enough of the band and vice versa. That’s why STRFKR came on stage for the last time and performed “Leave It All Behind” and “Maps” with their former bandmate, Patrick Morris. The audience was hyped to see an appearance from Morris, walking out of the show impressed out of their minds. Everybody came in wanting to hear “that one famous hit.” Everybody left wanting to hear every single song over and over again. Sunday, February 4, 2018 was a night to remember.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3265\" data-orig-width=\"4898\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/424fc132f4f5fd64573e6d6e5117e7ab/tumblr_inline_p6lby89HRL1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3265\" data-orig-width=\"4898\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eP.S.

And pride is the perfect word to describe the \u003ci\u003eBlack Panther\u003c/i\u003e album because it is cultural, it is timely, and above all else, it is “Black.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe album starts off with the title track “Black Panther,” a sole effort by Lamar to introduce the world of Wakanda and the mind of the film’s protagonist T’Challa. Lamar raps with precision and focus, utilizing repetition to highlight the significance and viewpoints of T’Challa and to introduce the opposing nature of antagonist Erik Killmonger. Hearing this song reminds me of an earlier Lamar song from his 2010 album \u003ci\u003eOverly Dedicated\u003c/i\u003e called “Heaven and Hell.” In this song, Lamar draws this distinction between good and evil, a tactic he uses in “Black Panther,” but rather then clearly distinguish the two, Lamar relies on ambiguity. It is through this ambiguity that we are engulfed not just into this opening track, but in the rest of the record as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFollowing the minimalist, constantly progressing opener is the album’s lead single “All The Stars,” with Lamar and SZA. With two of 2017’s biggest stars coming together for this track, the result is an undeniable hit, filled with a solemn, truth riddled verse by Lamar and a show stealing performance by SZA, who delivers dynamic vocals on the song’s chorus and a verse that is very reminiscent of her critically acclaimed \u003ci\u003eCtrl\u003c/i\u003e album. The song is a perfect combination of two musical juggernauts and it does a fantastic job of setting the tone moving forward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the lead single is an assortment of collaborations and production stylings that highlights a barrage of both vocal and production talent. The highly energetic and infectious “X” features a charismatic chorus by Lamar, and diverse, rapid fire verses from South African rapper Saudi, fellow TDE member ScHoolboy Q, and Def Jam signee 2 Chainz. Produced by !llmind \u0026amp; Sounwave, the track constitutes everything that makes a great hip hop record. However, following that record is “The Ways,” a tropical sounding, free flowing track that utilizes the self proclaimed “American Teen” Khalid and Rae Sremmurd member Swae Lee to full effect. Once again produced by Sounwave, but this time in collaboration with Lamar and music group BADBADNOTGOOD, the track is a departure from the energy prevalent on “X” but instead brings a much more mellow side that is apparent in the Wakanda universe. However, this mellow side is short lived, for immediately after this track is the bass heavy, highly eccentric “Opps” featuring Vince Staples and Yugen Blakrok, with uncredited vocals by Lamar again. A track produced by Sounwave and frequent Childish Gambino collaborator Ludwig Göransson, who is also the film’s composer, all three vocalists deliver verses that illustrate a fast-paced chase scene that is present in the film through a multitude of trailers. This song punctuates a three track run that houses a variety of features that fit seamlessly with the production, but only serves to be the beginning of this impeccable soundtrack.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe next three tracks make up, in my opinion, the best run of the whole record. “I Am,” a track that samples Travis Scott’s “Drugs You Should Try It” off of his 2014 effort \u003ci\u003eDays Before Rodeo\u003c/i\u003e, features the soulful stylings of Jorja Smith, who brings a vibrant presence that is matched by very few others on the whole LP. And much like Smith’s contributions to the album, very few contributors matched the raw energy that SOB X RBE brought forth on another standout track “Paramedic!” A track that accentuates the Vallejo, California’s hard hitting punchlines and multiple styles altogether is culminated by a Lamar hook that does not disappoint. Plus, the manner in which this song transitions flawlessly into “Bloody Waters,” by Ab-Soul, Anderson .Paak, and James Blake, makes the run that much better. In regards to “Bloody Waters,” speaking from a technical perspective, the track features some of the most prominent rapping aspects on the whole project, thanks to Ab-Soul. Showcasing wit and lyricism that was perfectly balanced with Anderson .Paak’s chorus and James Blakes’ intros and outros, the track plays immensely well and, as a result, is one of my favorites.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe soundtrack flows like an album in spite of it featuring different talent all across it. This can in large part be attributed to Sounwave’s production talents, as well as Lamar and Top Dawg’s “Anthony Tiffith’s” overall vision and the execution by the talent recruited. However, what it also does is provide something for just about everyone. For those that want high energy hip hop tracks that they can vibe and have fun with, there’s “X,” “Paramedic!,” “King’s Dead,” and even “Big Shot.” However, for those who place an affinity on rap lyrics, there’s “Black Panther,” “Opps,” “Bloody Waters,” and “Seasons” as well. All songs on this album are placed and sequenced well, showing black culture in a way that has not been showcased to mainstream media ever. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, \u003ci\u003eBlack Panther: The Album\u003c/i\u003e is a microcosm of the impact that the film \u003ci\u003eBlack Panther\u003c/i\u003e has had. With music that perfectly embodies not just the fictional country of Wakanda but the actual continent of Africa, and the struggle and plight of African-Americans, this album will prove to be a memorable soundtrack down the line, and not just because of its attachment to one of the year’s biggest films. Rather, it will be because some of music’s biggest stars were able to compose music with artistic integrity that reigns true to not just African-Americans, but also to the African heritage as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eFavorite Tracks:\u003c/b\u003e “All The Stars,” “I Am,” “Paramedic!” “Bloody Waters,” “Seasons,” and “Big Shot”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWorst Track:\u003c/b\u003e “Redemption” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eOverall Score:\u003c/b\u003e 8.5/10\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten by Clea Wurster \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Lodge Room is aptly named. Upon entering and joining the scattered crowd, I looked to the walls half expecting to find taxidermied deer and elk mounted, but was pleasantly disappointed when I found no such decor. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe stage sat opposite a big, welcoming bar - both cozy and open, luring audience members to spend absurd amounts of money on PBR to clutch as they swayed to the music. During the sets, front-row members of the audience treated the stage as though it was an extension of the bar, placing drinks along its edges to dance or leaning a hip against it, as though the weight of their own bodies was too heavy to attest to the quality of the music with the appropriate movements. The stage was so much a part of the room, it seemed difficult to separate a performer from an audience member at first glance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMolly Burch quietly took the stage to open for Alex Cameron. She started out with her love song “Please Be Mine,” recorded on her first album of the same name which was released last February. Beginning with the loud chatter of the bar as a background to her voice, she appeared subtle in all possible ways, sporting simple contentment that felt at odds with the emotionally torn sentiment of the song. The past year of touring that she’s done didn’t seem to give her more comfort on the stage - it seemed like this could’ve been her first, nervous experience on stage had I not known otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEverything about her presence felt out of focus, warm and sweet, down to the asymmetrically collared, knee-length dress that she wore - reminiscent of a schoolgirl’s uniform. Her voice, her face, even her hair suggested timidity and kindness with a twist of what could be construed as seduction, if the lighting were just so. And the lighting was just so: she was back lit by deep red and purple hues that gave the Lodge Room, and Burch, an unexpected air of  intimacy that perfectly accented her set list, which told the story of losing someone and finding them again. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith lyrics such as, “I’d never felt like this before,” in “Not Today,” and, “You said I was the only one, but I know you say that to all the girls,” Burch wrapped the audience up in her lovesickness, folding us up in her pining after love and making us all complicit in the messy break up that her music recounts through honest and clear vocals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHer voice rang true to her record, at times soft and soulful, and often matched with a furrow to her otherwise pleasant smile or soft frown, but even as she hit the deeper, more expressive ranges that her voice has to offer, the audience seemed wary of tuning in. While some in the front row closed their eyes and swayed softly along with Burch, most continued to raise glasses to their mouths, laughing and talking loudly about the next set and tuning out her performance. That being said, Burch truly embodied her work. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the performance continued, the persuasiveness of her sultry girl-next-door charm seemed to win over more and more of the crowd. As she continued her set list, singing what can only be described as sappy love songs (allegedly about her guitarist), couples began to fold into each other, lazily hanging on to one another’s arms and glancing into one another's’ eyes. Burch’s voice spread to the edges of the room, enticing even those still firmly planted at the edge of the bar to glance her way. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHer performance began with an uncertainty, a quietness, but Burch seemed to push further and further away from this feigned insecurity, becoming more sure of her own voice and body. At first, she had wandered away from the mic, seemingly unaware of her audience - encapsulated by her music and framed by her nondescript musicians. She could have been singing to herself in an empty room for all we knew. But as the evening progressed, Burch found purchase in her voice and her crowd, relaxing into the performance, casting playful smiles and bashful flutterings of her lashes to match the tones of her jazzy, but pop-ish sound. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile her stage presence came off initially as underwhelming, consisting only of small hand movements and haphazard swaying, she perfectly embodied the sickly sweet tones of her music and her voice. By the end of her set, each song had elicited a louder response than the last and the audience had relented to her consistent and unflinching voice, which broke only in the ways you hoped it would and swayed delicately along with her body.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Between sets the audience buzzed with excitement for headliner Cameron, chatting about his music and bobbing their heads to the 80s-esque muzak that emanated from the speakers. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009When the band took the stage, the audience immediately dropped their conversations and directed their attention to the tall, slim Cameron, who was dressed in all black with his characteristic slicked back hair, though it was much shorter than I expected, having watched too many of his oddly curated music videos.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Once mics were adjusted and instruments were picked up, Cameron wasted no time in jumping into his first song: “Studmuffin96.” Cameron cheekily danced at the audience, capturing their attention and prompting varied shouts from across the venue. While his persona was difficult to resist, the monotony of the first song left me feeling as though I’d somehow gotten stuck in a loop of the same 10 seconds, destined to continue hearing the chorus, “I’m looking for my lover, she’s almost 17,” an infinite number of times and rolling my eyes at the notion of this fully grown man seeking out children.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut his humor soon won me over, and I let myself relish the saxophone, masterfully played by Roy Meloy, amid the retro-pop-ish feel of the songs. Even those listeners who looked like they wished they could vacate their own bodies and exist externally from the awkwardness of their elbows and ankles were doing their best to move along with beats. The stilted dancing fit perfectly in with Cameron’s own absurd moves. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough some seemed resentful of the downright grooviness of the set, others relinquished themselves to it - genuinely headbanging to a saxophone, something I can say I haven’t quite seen before. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCameron seemed sharply aware of his own presence - an irony colored each song and every twitch of his hips. He carried on conversations with his audience, never missing an opportunity for a witty anecdote about the song he was performing. It felt like the cool kids club \u0026ndash; we were all in on something, we all got it. Whatever Cameron was hip to, he made sure we were cued in and we ate it up. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe uncomfortable, posed appearance of the band only contributed to the performance. It seemed that even his bassist, who looked like a 12-year old amongst a crowd much too old for him, was putting on his own show. Not to mention the guitarist faintly reminded me of a \u003ci\u003eBeetlejuice\u003c/i\u003e character, sporting a teased mullet and standing expressionless to the left of Cameron. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCameron himself characterized the energy as “good,” and while I may have chosen a more poignant adjective, I couldn’t agree more. There was something special about being in that audience, something joyful and cynical all at once. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis wit was matched only by his own dance moves and the steadiness of his voice. Some choice jokes were darker than others: he introduced “Take Care of Business” as a song that he thought was about his ex-girlfriend, but he soon realized was about his mom. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCameron proved himself as not only a clever lyricist and consistent vocalist, but a comedic figure and a well-rounded performer capable of convincing anyone, even me, of his charm and biting hilarity. \u003c/p\u003e",

Ramage\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDriving down to downtown Los Angeles on a Wednesday night, facing the 405 traffic, and finding affordable parking is a mission and a half. Add the fact that it was Valentine’s Day as well! Couples going to their dinner date nights, partners racing across LA to meet each other, and last minute flowers being bought. However, if the mission is to see Kimbra Lee Johnson, known as Kimbra, perform her new album, \u003ci\u003ePrimal Heart,\u003c/i\u003e live? Well, the road rage and $10 is well worth it. Kimbra performed at the glamorous, elegant, and beautifully designed Ace Hotel. The minute you walk in, an aura of regal charm and fantasy entrances you. Love was in the air. Chatter about seeing everyone’s Valentine, Kimbra, that night perform made the anticipation of her set so much more exciting. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e​Kimbra had the amazing Grammy-nominated KING and Rhode-Island based Aric Iris open for her. After their sets, more people trickled into the luxurious theatre and bubbled in anticipation. As soon as the lights were cut, the whole theatre screamed, sucked in an extra long breath, and clapped. Our breathes were soon taken again as Kimbra’s stage lit up. Lights flashed and two translucent cubes were illuminated. Behind the cubes were Kimbra’s bassist/guitarist and keyboardist. They were clad in rad modern pop abstract black and white blazers. Soon afterwards, Kimbra came out in a variously striped high-fashion black and white dress and black heels, perfectly synchronized with her band. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e​Kimbra smiled at the crowd and began expelling her magic. Kimbra started with “Version of Me” and the minute her mouth opened, handfuls of fans screamed in amazement of her energy and powerful voice. Her voice radiated the whole theater and the geometric cubes behind her changed colour. The landscape of the cubes were in perfect pulsation of the vibrations and melodies within every song. She played multiple new songs off her album, \u003ci\u003ePrimal Heart\u003c/i\u003e, set to release April 20. She went on to play, “Hi Def Distance Romance,” “The Good War,” “Black Sky,” and her latest single, “Human.” Every new song entranced you into Kimbra’s psychedelic world, but also forced you to confront personal parts of yourself in an extremely healing, but dance-provoking way. Her lyrics eviscerate your emotions, but the beats and energy surging out of her body rose the audience into ecstasy. The crowd was clearly eating her up. Random spurts of fans yelling out, “Yessss queen, kill it!.” Or, “I love you so much!” Or, “Please never stop making music!” Or just plain and simple screaming out of excitement, joy, and amazement. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/84d7c4f13400d2ef55e9bad6146c8ff4/tumblr_inline_p4s5jbiRdm1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e​Song after song, Kimbra’s voice never waivered, but most importantly, her energy, charisma, and dynamite presence on stage proliferated as the show went on. As fans and audience members, the sight of an artist embodying her most creative and abundant spirit on stage was intoxicating and infectious. Kimbra transformed into an intergalactic goddess, dancing in front of human, yet alien-like faces, heat-maps, clouds of neon lights, and waves of light, to an earth princess soaring through the ocean and rock formations, flowers, and elemental and transcending waves. At one point, the background even turned into black and white stripes. The background blended in with her dress and within every one of Kimbra’s electrifying dance moves. It was almost as if she was disappearing into a melodic abyss. Finally, Kimbra also transformed into the simplicity of an atom…blending in with geometric shapes and sparkling beams, as if your eyes were closed and the darkness turned into the colourful speckles of light that appear, gracefully beckoning our ascendence into the world she had carefully constructed for the audience that night. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e​Kimbra also sang songs off her beloved 2011 album, \u003ci\u003eVows\u003c/i\u003e, and the hits, “Settle Down” and “Two Way Street.” Though these songs came out in 2011, it is seven years later and Kimbra managed to remix and play these songs in perfect embodiment of the musical level she was showcasing for \u003ci\u003ePrimal Heart\u003c/i\u003e. Kimbra’s growth as an artist came full circle and she proudly showcased it during this part of the set. The songs I loved playing on my iPod in 2011 were brought to another elemental, soul-striking, and transcending level and I could not get enough. She also played songs off her 2014 album, \u003ci\u003eThe Golden Echo\u003c/i\u003e, which she created in LA when she was living here. Off of \u003ci\u003eThe Golden Echo\u003c/i\u003e, Kimbra played “As You Are” and “Love in High Places.” On Valentine’s Day, Kimbra was Cupid, pointing her arrow to all of our hearts and taking the love we have for her to an exponentially higher caliber. She even went back to her original place, picked up her guitar, and played “Past Love” off of \u003ci\u003ePrimal Heart\u003c/i\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e​In picking up her guitar and going back to the roots of her singer-songwriter career, Kimbra proved she is a musical legend and a force to be reckoned with. The geometric cubes go dark and soft lights are directed at her on the right side of the stage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4e3e6fea6172ac303178e6624ea6e96a/tumblr_inline_p4s5jykm8k1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e​One minute she was singing with her whole entire body, being in tune with her melodies, lyrics, and beats, gracefully pounding on the impressive set of electronics in front of her and then, was simply strumming her guitar and commanding the entire audience with her raw and emotionally-vibrant voice. Her soul transcended throughout “Past Love” and was an excellent highlight of her talent. The chords are lush, dreamy, and sounded extremely full. Kimbra sang out the last lyric, immediately put her guitar down, and went back to her electronics. Kimbra bumped “Two Way Street” after, and then “Lightyears.” The geometric cubes behind her continued to radiate behind her. Kimbra even stepped away from her electronics and danced where the cubes meet, creating a vertex of illusion, laced with her whimsical energy. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e​Kimbra then beckoned her audience to stand-up and dance! It was Valentine’s Day, after all. She said, “This one is SEXY.” The song was extremely groovy and reminded me of disco-funk. The whole audience was jumping, dancing, and laughing. The genuine and pure look of euphoria on Kimbra’s face after the song ended was priceless. Kimbra then finished her set with, “Top of the World” - another single off of \u003ci\u003ePrimal Heart.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e​Within each new song off her album, Kimbra explores a multitude of personas and musical dimensions. But “Top of the World” takes you to the most primal and powerful part of your heart. The minute the first beat dropped, the crowd, and myself, went nuts. This song is empowering and motivates its listener to do just about anything your heart desires. It encapsulates everything about art pop and alternative R\u0026amp;B. The subtle anger Kimbra exudes pumps you up with angst and aggression, but ultimately uplifts you, makes you soar, and feel seen. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e​Kimbra thanked her fans, the crowd, her opening acts, her band mates, and humbly left the stage. For an encore, Kimbra walked back alone and told the audience that this was a song she has been experimenting and tinkering with throughout the tour. She was vulnerable, but open to mistakes, which is something so beautiful to see after such a bad-ass and empowering 13-song set from Kimbra. She performed “Real Life”, a stripped down, emotional, and ambient tune. She finished, smiled the biggest smile she had throughout the whole concert, bowed, blew a kiss, and exited the stage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e​Kimbra truly makes her audience feel…..on Top of the World.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3244\" data-orig-width=\"5503\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d59dc9234a42fa815804aba1428303eb/tumblr_inline_p4s5knuiyA1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3244\" data-orig-width=\"5503\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

While Rock still tackles the themes that he’s grown so familiar with, of race relations, poverty, and other perceived flaws in America, he does so for the first time with the backdrop of his own personal problems as a self-deprecating contrast point. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike his previous shows, namely 1999’s “Bigger \u0026amp; Blacker” and 2004’s “Never Scared,” Rock doesn’t play around, or ease his audience into any false sense of stability before hitting them with big jokes. Rock starts off his show very quickly with a joke about police brutality, not only to register a big laugh, but also so that his audience knows to stay on their toes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt this point, hearing the state of the audience’s laughter after more humorous analysis of police brutality in the United States, it’s clear that this special is in a far more intimate setting than the stadiums that Rock’s earlier shows played host to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s clear that the more closed setting reflects Rock’s mental space at this point in his career and life. His analysis of gun violence and the attitude towards it in American society is only an opener. He hits the audience with quick but nonetheless funny jokes such as, “If a 100 people ever got stabbed to death at the same time, in the same place, by the same person, you know what that would mean? 97 people deserved to die.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaterial like this isn’t the meat of Rock’s routine, but it’s still in line with the theme of the special. The show follows a clear trend of getting closer and closer to Rock himself. He next focuses on his attitude as a black parent in the modern world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRock at this point treats the audience like they are his kids and he is delivering a lesson to them in the form of a stand up. Rock’s key line in this segment of the stand up is his lesson, “As soon as you leave this door, nobody gives a fuck about you!” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe’s referring to the attitude he wants his kids to have, and as funny as the line is, it also seems to go deeper. Rock is trying to send a message to his audience, not only to his African American listeners, as he does make it clear, like in previous specials to include brief remarks, excluding the white members of his audience to comedic effect, especially when criticizing his perceived societal bias towards white people. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter a clever and hilarious critique of the current state of America, Rock circles around to the common trope of relationships, but this is Rock, and of course he brings his own flair and perspective to it. Quite distinctly, he also brings his own experiences, cheating on his wife, and the divorce he went through. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRock makes this final part of his special a cautionary tale for his audience, essentially berating his own decisions as a married man and laying out his mistakes in humorous fashion to great effect, both inducing laughter and to a certain extent sympathy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, Rock’s “Tambourine” (I’d reveal why It’s called tambourine but that would void one of his best gags,) is a solid addition to Rock’s already infamous stand up record. Scaling down seems to be the underlying theme of the special, not only the stadium, but also his ego, and his usually grandiose style of comedy. He does not, however, scale down the laughs, and if you’re a fan of any of his shows, movies, previous stand up, or just want an hour to laugh and give you something to think about, then give Rock’s “Tambourine” a shake!\u003c/p\u003e",

The rapper is famous for dropping this kind of EP along the way to promise the listeners that he is working on more hitmakers for his later albums like the tracks on his EPs. 2 Chainz’s new wave of having long names for his album titles became a way for him to step up as an artist and truly share his moments with the listeners. The choice of making the titles of the tracks uppercase gives out the statements that will be made with each tracks, a little reminiscent of Kung-Fu Kenny style.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first track, “OK BITCH,” starts off with melodic rapping, along with the support of trap sounds like rap flutes and piano loops, that together create a flowing harmony. Continuing with “PROUD,” featuring YG and OFFSET, the rappers do exactly the opposite of praising themselves, and are delicate and appreciative of their mothers - 2 Chainz raps, “I\u0026rsquo;m just tryna make my mama proud.” But 2 Chainz really show his power with rhyme with his chorus, “I hop on the beat/Her body on fleek/My pockets obese/My partner gon\u0026rsquo; eat/My partner a G/We straight out the street/Home of the Braves/Land of the freaks,” on “LAND OF THE FREAKS.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, the rapper finishes off his EP with another powerful statement piece, “LAMBORGHINI TRUCK (ATLANTA SHIT).” 2 Chainz deeply shows his emotions, asking for a better side of the times we are living in. He sentimentally raps about his hometown of Georgia accompanied with slow vocals. The track calls-out the underrated rappers of Atlanta and the friends that 2 Chainz has lost in the same city.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eComposed of only four tracks, the EP is more than enough to state what the 40 year-old rapper, 2 Chainz, had witnessed in his city and within the rap game over the years. His success comes from understanding his environment in Atlanta and knowing how to share it with other people. Therefore, the title \u003ci\u003eThe Play Don’t Care Who Makes It \u003c/i\u003eis very self-explanatory and inspiring to the new generation. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/5C3uZS83u9pXWFEpl47hWb\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e",

Before the release of \u003ci\u003eMANIA\u003c/i\u003e, my knowledge to the band was limited to 3 singles: “Centuries,” “Sugar,” “We’re Goin Down,” and “Thnks fr th Mmrs.” Unlike most people, who have long abandoned their emo phases and arespending their efforts on forgetting their cringey teenage years, in recent years I become increasingly interested in the alternative rock community. I have no problem admitting that Brendon Urie is my religion and sexuality (please don’t take this offensively) and that I am a big Panic! At The Disco fan. Thus, when Urie tweeted about \u003ci\u003eMANIA\u003c/i\u003e as his way ofsupporting and promoting, I thought it was a great opportunity for me to dive a bit deeper into the abyss of emoness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was in the gym when I first listened to the album. Undoubtedly, it’s a great workout track (insert edgy teens screaming with angst). Jumping from different genres like EDM to the usual pop rock, from the familiar inspirational anthems to the slightly more mellow self analysis\u0026hellip;Fall Out Boy as a band is seemingly trying to figure out a route for their future direction. \u003ci\u003eMANIA\u003c/i\u003e in many ways serves as a transitional album, yet nevertheless, it is still a great record consisting of the normal Fall Out Boy elements - angst and determination. The theme remains mysterious, experimental, and steadily on edge throughout the whole album. Something new, mostly as usual.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eACTUAL SONGS\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e“Young and Menace”\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Young and Menace” was released as the first single way back in April 2017. I really don’t want to imagine the initial reaction of their die-hard fans - this song follows the generic EDM style. If I wasn’t on the treadmill running, I would’ve probably stopped listening to the entire album all together. It’s just\u0026hellip;very different from what anyone would expect from Fall Out Boy. Though, after the whole album was released, “Young and Menace” does seem like a good fit for a slightly slower opening that is anticipating for more. In addition, it does follow the general Fall Out Boy equation: I’m the best, you just need to wait and see. Thistrack was a lure put out by Fall Out Boy as a tease, it’s just a smoke bomb.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e“Champion”\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI really, have no idea how did I make through the first two tracks. “Champion” can almost be considered as a direct sequel of “Centuries” from their last album. This is probably the most Fall Out Boy song out of the entire album: heavy drum, main melody illustrated by electric guitars, a build-up anticipated for an absolute explosion for the chorus. Which means the lyrics of “Champion” are just as corny and inspirational as all their other singles in recent years. Well, it’s a great song for its purpose, I’m just really spoiled by the meaningful and dramatic lyrics by Panic!.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e“Stay Frosty Royal Milk Tea”\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of Panic!, this is actually Urie’s favorite song from \u003ci\u003eMANIA\u003c/i\u003e. Dramatic to a point where you can feel a sense of violence, packed with metaphors and allegories\u0026hellip;wait but what the hell is “Stay Frosty Royal Milk Tea” actually supposed to mean?! There are really about only two bands left who would dare to have such random names for their songs. Particularly, “Stay Frosty Royal Milk Tea” can easily be qualified as a song from Panic!\u0026ndash;if it didn’t have the repetitive lyrics. Oh, Fall Out Boy with their reassuring, repetitive lyric patterns. Well, it’s nice branding. Nevertheless, the drama and intensity always ensure the uniqueness of the band. Not that many drummers would go hard on the drums like how Andy Hurley does it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e“HOLD ME TIGHT OR DON’T”\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis song leaves me with so many questions. As the only song title with capitalized letters, “HOLD ME TIGHT OR DON’T” is the least rock song from this rock album. Patrick Stump’s voice sounded almost a bit naggy, accompanied by a repetitive guitar chord pattern throughout the whole song - this is Fall Out Boy’s take on love and breakup songs. The right amount of hesitation, passion, and as usual, right amount of drum and electric guitar ringing in the back of your head. I always see this song as an intermission of \u003ci\u003eMANIA\u003c/i\u003e: the calmness before the return of the storm, the last goodbye before the start of a war.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e“The Last of the Real Ones”\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom this point on, I love every single song remaining on the album. “The Last of the Real Ones” is my second favorite from \u003ci\u003eMANIA\u003c/i\u003e. The whole song is preaching the glory of someone, with an overuse of metaphors and exaggerations. Can you tell? I. Love. Drama. In today’s music industry, where people praise EDM, tropical beats, and hip-hop more than anything, bands like Fall Out Boy become increasingly niche-like (always has been, but increasingly). They ARE the “last of a dying breed,” but I love alternative rock way too much to ever let go. I take this song as a scream of truth from the band, and I just love the cheeky, mellow piano sub-melody in the background so much.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e“Wilson (Expensive Mistake)”\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s still too early into the year for me to call this song “Song of the Year,” but I love it so much I just want this year to be over already. “Wilson” portrays a loser’s story, someone who had made too many expensive mistakes, an outcast who was left reminiscing and questioning their leftover existence. Call me an angsty teen, but I love loser anthems like this one: “Death of A Bachelor” by Panic! At The Disco, “Cancer” by My Chemical Romance, and the iconic “Bohemian Rhapsody” by Queen. “Wilson” illustrates such a sad story with Fall Out Boy’s (almost sardonic-sounding) slightly less intense drum beats and oddly unusual major key melody. The absolutely amazing irony of this song needs to be appreciated more in the coming year, please.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e“Church”\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI always find it interesting when the emo rock bands use religious allegories - even though they really don’t give much of a shit about religions at all. There is one particular line from “Church” that I love: “And if death is the last appointment | Then we’re all just sitting in the waiting room | I am just a human trying to avoid my certain doom.” This is probably the best way to summarize my own atheist belief. It was also really interesting to learn about the backstory behind the production of this song. The way they manage to incorporate everyone’s style for songs is something that many other bands have failed to do, but something that should definitely be considered and treasured more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZ4q2d13O4w\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFall Out Boy\u0026rsquo;s Patrick Stump Breaks Down Cinematic New Song \u0026ldquo;Church\u0026quot; \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e“Heaven’s Gate”\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePersonally, a more jazzy, chill vibe is always needed in the middle of an album. “Heaven’s Gate” is the most stand-alone song with a distinguishably different style from any other number from \u003ci\u003eMANIA\u003c/i\u003e. I remember letting the record play on the highest volume as I lay on the floor, trying to recover from my cold. Well, I just ended up feeling like I’m really, really high. The story within the lyrics is just way too beautiful for an emo who might never get in a worthwhile, intimate relationship like the one in “Heaven’s Gate.” It’s also just amazing to see Fall Out Boy stepping out of their comfort zone to do a more folk-like song, yet they somehow managed to keep their own style going.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e“Sunshine Riptide”\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eMANIA\u003c/i\u003e took a long time to be released. The band started the production of it way back in 2016 and pushed the release date back multiple times. This is an album for nobody but Fall Out Boy themselves, an album about their own growth as artists and creators. “Sunshine Riptide” is another one of those Los Angeles songs. There are so many songs about LA that it should just become a genre on its own. Fall Out Boy’s approach is a bit less sardonic than most other LA songs; instead, “Sunshine Riptide” is just plainly sad, a song about winner’s loneliness and sorrow for limitations and misunderstandings. Perhaps after all, this is something that the band members themselves had experienced/are experiencing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e“Bishops Knife Trick”\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI love it when an album has a proper conclusion that ties the whole theme and story line back together. “Bishops Knife Trick” is an unusually slow song for Fall Out Boy. Instead of being an inspiring, upbeat song, this song is a self portrait for the band itself. 15 years after the band was formed, there seem to be many things that are still left unresolved for the boys. Yet, it is clear that the dedication and passion of the members will continue to lead the band towards new highs. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Once again, I’m only a part-time emo who’s trying to understand this world, don’t come at me if this is a bit superficial. I want to conclude this album as something that’s enjoyable for many different groups of music listeners. There is much more to \u003ci\u003eMANIA\u003c/i\u003e that can be further broken down, such as the mysterious purple llamas in the music videos. I also found a great video breaking down the style and general theme of the album, it helped me a lot when I first listened to the record. Overall, 10/10 as an emo album, 8/10 as a great album in general.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdditional video link: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZNO3Ds6yVU\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eENTIRE MANIA ALBUM EXPLAINED | Fall Out Boy\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Is your knowledge of music theory self-taught, were you classically trained, or are you just oddly knowledgeable?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m actually classically trained on piano. I studied classical piano for about eight years, then moved on to studying jazz piano right when I started college.  While I was studying classical piano, I took an annual Certificate of Merit exam that required certain levels of music theory knowledge and performance skills, and passed the highest level when I finished high school, so that’s where I got all of my music theory knowledge that I use on \u003ci\u003eMusicology\u003c/i\u003e. I center my themes on different music theory themes because I feel these themes represent different aspects of music that deserve to be looked at.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDo you think understanding technical music theory or structure enhances people’s abilities to emotionally respond to music?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eDefinitely.  As boring as studying music theory is, it becomes applicable to all the music you listen to.  It really helps break down the science of music and changes your approach to listening to music.  Music itself is already emotionally powerful enough, but knowing music theory will teach you WHY it’s emotionally powerful to you, and it’s a really ear-opening experience in my opinion. You start noticing all these little things that you never would have noticed if you didn’t know music theory, which is why I do \u003ci\u003eMusicology\u003c/i\u003e in the first place - to teach everyone some basics and tips for appreciating the artistry of music that isn’t immediately noticeable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTechnology is rapidly advancing to create music using algorithms and pattern-detection software. As someone versed in the “rules” of music theory, will there ever be a day when computer-generated music creates better music than humans themselves can compose?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I would practice piano as a kid, my dad would always tell me to never “play like a robot” (he’d likewise criticize pianists who did.) That’s his way of saying that a good pianist doesn’t just play every note perfectly; a good pianist feels the notes. I think the same applies to composing music. Music has always been an emotional art form of expression, and the process of writing music extends beyond technical knowledge and involves a deeper emotional knowledge of expression. Music theory is ultimately just a useful tool to express the greater emotional idea of music, it’s not a definite formula to writing good music. Part of what makes music exciting for me is that humans are able to break the established rules of music theory to create innovative new sounds, rhythms, and compositions to express more complex ideas, effectively creating new rules of expression. Erik Satie was criticized for breaking Impressionistic musical conventions, but now he’s viewed as one of the more well-known innovators of avant-garde music (don’t quote me on that). Or even look at Death Grips today.  Do you think a computer program could come up with that, let alone a human other than MC Ride and Zach Hill? It’d just be an incoherent project if an algorithm tried to develop an innovative song, due to the near infinite possibilities of chord tonalities and voicings, what “rules” to break, when to break those rules, or how to break those rules. And, above all, there’s no emotional backbone to construct these notes. You can give a program every “good rule” in the music book and I’m sure it’ll write good music, but I doubt you can program the innovation or heart to produce great music.  And humans are very good at determining whether a song has heart. Even if an algorithm wrote a good song, you’d need human musicians to convey the song’s emotion by performing it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7ce0639d0abdf9d3542471e48b4bc15c/tumblr_inline_p3n5t2l21o1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2\u003eI was looking through your playlists and noticed that like me, you are a member of the BROCKHAMPTON’s large and angsty fan base. Of the members, whose musical style do you admire the most and why?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’ll be honest, I’m very bad at following BROCKHAMPTON as a boy band and only know their music well, not so much the individual styles. But, that said, in terms of musical style, my favorite is Bearface. I always have a soft spot for heart-wrenching melodies and lush guitar chords, and he’s honestly the reason I look forward to the end of a BROCKHAMPTON album.  He’s like Daniel Caesar in that he uses some of the most formulaic chords and structures but manages to make it so fresh in the context of soul and hip hop. Plus, all of those songs are dreamy. In a few years when those songs become pop standards, they’ll be a guilty pleasure of mine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat is one thing that people should know about you, your show, or both?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs much as I’m a nerd for music, I’m also a huge nerd of all things pop culture, sci fi, comic book, and fantasy.

It is currently a trending topic on Twitter, but anyone unfamiliar with the show may be lost when they see memes referencing it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo what is \u003ci\u003eBlack Mirror\u003c/i\u003e? Maybe you’re trying to convince yourself to watch the show but you haven’t read a review worthy enough to sway you. Well, if you’re looking to be persuaded, I’m not sure that’s what you’ll find. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eBlack Mirror\u003c/i\u003e is a show on technology and how it can impact humanity. Usually it’s a negative impact, so if you’re tired of hearing from your parents that any shortcomings of yours are “because you’re always on your phone,” then maybe this isn’t the show for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut if you’re interested in seeing several unrelated, stand-alone episodes, then this is the show for you. Now, anyone who listens to my radio show (Mama Rumba on Tuesdays at 7pm) knows that I cannot commit to television shows. I simply do not have the patience to watch a year’s worth of a character’s storyline, I’m no “commitment-phobe” person but I heavily dislike cliffhangers, and having to wait a year or so for a show to start up again after its season finale is not the way I live my life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D5ELQ6u_5YYM\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5ELQ6u_5YYM?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003ePoint being, \u003ci\u003eBlack Mirror\u003c/i\u003e helps you avoid this dilemma, each episode has new characters, a new setting and a new technological advancement. *\u003ci\u003esinister laugh\u003c/i\u003e*\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m really not attempting to sell this show to anyone.

Season 4 is perhaps the most frightening experience of all of the seasons I’ve watched so far. You’ve probably seen a hashtag on Twitter  - #blackmuseum. Well, if I were to try to convince someone, anyone, say Netflix was sponsoring me to really convince people to watch the show, then I’d tell people to watch “Black Museum,” the final episode of season 4. This episode alone encompasses the entire series. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis episode prompted intense feelings of disgust, both at some fictional technological advancements, and how desperate people were coerced into using these devices by businessmen.

But if you really enjoyed this episode, then you’ll surely enjoy what all four seasons of this show has to offer. \u003c/p\u003e",

Though both artists have a background in folk rock, the album more closely reflects Vile\u0026rsquo;s style. Barnett\u0026rsquo;s usual garage sound has very little influence on the collaboration. Vile\u0026rsquo;s gruffness and country twang exists for duets \u0026ndash; late last year he contributed to the Hope Sandoval and the Warm Inventions album \u003ci\u003eUntil the Hunter\u003c/i\u003e with the lead single, “Let Me Get There.” “Let Me Get There” pairs Vile\u0026rsquo;s rough tone with Sandoval\u0026rsquo;s ethereal vocals, a highly successful combination. The track highlights what \u003ci\u003eLotta Sea Lice\u003c/i\u003e is missing\u0026ndash; a better contrast between vocal textures \u0026ndash; Barnett\u0026rsquo;s voice is simply a different shade of Vile\u0026rsquo;s, with a similar huskiness. The songs that work best on the album are the ones in which Barnett’s voice sounds brighter and distinguishes itself from Vile’s, such as in “Over Everything,” one of the principal tracks. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJQs5XagfheI\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JQs5XagfheI?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eOther highlights of the album include “Continental Breakfast,” the playful “Blue Cheese,” and “Untogether.” “Continental Breakfast” is an airy, sweet song that feels fresh against the rest of the album. “Blue Cheese” features a lighthearted exchange with childish teases and taunts. “Outta the Woodwork,” a less distinctive tune, is a cover of one of Barnett’s own songs; however, the original is preferable as Barnett’s vocals work far better on the track than do Vile’s. The fun that went into creating the album shines through, making it impossible for the listener not to appreciate the work, though at points it feels as if the songs meld together without distinct tracks.  Overall, the collaboration between Barnett and Vile is enjoyable, however, it does not make a lasting impression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3gvo4nvimDdqA9c3y7Bptc\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten by Helen Lee\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The first time we were here in LA, we had just sold out in a tiny, tiny theater and I thought to myself, man, we made it. How amazing, how beautiful is it that we could be anywhere in the universe right now, and right here in this moment we are here together in the beautiful city of Los Angeles?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRight here in this very spot on the concert floor, screaming my lungs out crammed next to 1600 strangers, two of which just had to be escorted out by security, G-Eazy. I replied rhetorically in my head. By the way, can I call you Gerald\u0026ndash; is anyone allowed to call you Gerald?\u003cbr/\u003e* * *\u003cbr/\u003eNot too many artists hone the ability to make a large theater filled with 21873 different people of different ages and backgrounds feel intimate. Even fewer artists hone their craft to tell a natural, rhapsodizing story, a progressive narrative. Every act felt so natural, as eazy-going as having a mental conversation with him when he addressed the audience, singing along with the bangers on his new album \u003ci\u003eThe Damned \u0026amp; Beautiful\u003c/i\u003e, and feeling a thing or two when he introspectively reflected on the themes of growth and change. Watching G-Eazy perform live at the Wiltern was an experience that both carefully straddled and boldly meshed these concepts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWalking in, I was immediately swept in by the grandiose, lavish Art-Deco inspired beauty that the Wiltern Theatre boasts. I immediately thought about how fitting the venue was as an accompaniment for the themes of fame and glory that \u003ci\u003eThe Damned \u0026amp; The Beautiful\u003c/i\u003e explores. The glittering interior evoked a period of elegance and cheerfully extravagant style that made me glad I wasn’t drinking anything, as drinking anything less than champagne would feel like a disappointment - and if I were drinking, I certainly would not have been drinking champagne. The hallmark of this show, aside from the allure of the beautiful lights and the glamorously retro theatre vibes that the Wiltern had to offer (and the surprise appearance by Halsey during the Epilogue-encore that could only be described as a cosmic explosion of chemistry) was the thematic elements of the show. The show itself was broken apart into three separate parts and\u003cbr/\u003ethen intricately woven to create one dynamic show. “Part 1: The Beautiful,” “Part 2: The Damned,” and “Part 3: The Epilogue.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn “Part 1: The Beautiful,” G-Eazy opened with the melodical hits of the album, like “The Beautiful and Damned” and “Pray for Me.” He began explosively, wowing the audience with colorful blends of smoke, and shooting fire into the air. At 6’4”, G-Eazy commandeered the vast and expansive stage with his larger than life stage presence, dressed in a black leather motorcycle jacket and simple black ensemble. While he was dressed simply, the bright, flashing graphics behind him visually contraposed him and with each and every song following suit, like “Some Kind of Drug,” it felt like a slow and steady build-up, a tension of opposing ideas. Thematically, “The Beautiful” seemingly represented the inner tension of losing values to fame, and even represented a simpler, more beautiful time with reminiscent songs like, “But a Dream.” Throughout this entire\u003cbr/\u003eact the audience went wild, singing along and yelling, while also engaged in a\u003cbr/\u003ethoughtful inner dialogue. To me, this entire act could be summed up by feeling like I was chasing the ephemeral and intangible, while being thoroughly enthralled by wondering, “Who is this incredibly talented and captivating man?” The graphics portrayed the troublesome and contemplative dichotomy of the struggles between good and evil, rich and poor, the beautiful and damned while the theater pulsed with the rhythmic beat drops and the rhyming of cleverly spun lyrics. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe crux and build up led to “Part 2: The Damned,” where G-Eazy momentarily disappeared off stage to reappear in a bright white strait-jacket. The whole theater reverberated with the first key opening bars of “Leviathan,” and the rest of the stage was engulfed by the bright red-orange hues of heat and flames. As the stage lit up with flames, G-Eazy also kept up with the new dynamic, and figuratively spat fire line-by-line, especially with tracks like “That’s A Lot” and “You Got Me,” coming full circle and concluding his act with “Eazy.” This act was full of themes of rapture and paying homage to his long journey of music, as well as dissecting what fame and “making it” really entails. In comparison to “Part 1: The Beautiful,” Part 2 was much more lyrically intense and powerful and rather than introspective, it was retrospective and reflective.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e* * *\u003cbr/\u003e“I remember when I was bouncing around, living out of a suitcase, crashing on friends’ couches living at AirBnbs, hotels, trying to make the album. But look at us now, Los Angeles. We made it. Tonight, we made it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSensing that the set was coming to a close, the audience roared, clinging onto every word that he was addressing to each and every one of us, in the midst of singing “Eazy.” We were drunk on the atmosphere (definitely not champagne), intoxicated by his influence and charisma, and addicted to his flow. The final few lines of “Eazy” set the reflective, reminiscent tone of looking back at his entire journey to get to where he is. I reconciled this being the closing and contently accepted that this would be it. Boy, was I wrong. These final lines became the perfect segue to “The Epilogue.” This was just the beginning, the beginning of the actual climax of the show. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eG-Eazy left the stage, and the lights went out, leaving the audience enraptured in complete darkness and silence. In response, the crowd began to shout “Encore,” until the entire theater was filled with screams of anticipation. At the zenith and peak of expectation, the screen flashed with the words “Part 3: The Epilogue.” Then the first few familiar bars of “Him and I” filled the room. Before our very eyes, Halsey walked across the stage, followed by G-Eazy. The crowd exploded in a frenzy of excitement and gratification, as the chemistry between Halsey and G-Eazy was so passionately apparent. Sparks of connection and sexual tension heated up the stage to create a phenomenal performance between the duo. The epilogue represented G-Eazy’s life in the present day, with his greatest hits following such as “Me, Myself \u0026amp; I” and “No Limit.” The final moments of his entire show can only be described as purely euphoric, and the crowning glory of G-Eazy’s career.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, G-Eazy is not only someone who has the talent, drive, and unique ability to make a crowded room feel intimate, but an artist who knows how to meet your expectations and then completely ignite them to create a completely inexplicable and extraordinary experience.\u003c/p\u003e",

It tells the story of Christine “Lady Bird” McPherson, an angsty high school senior who desperately wishes to escape the monotony of suburban Sacramento. The film navigates her turbulent relationship with her parents, virginity, the difficulty of fitting in, and her poor socioeconomic status. From prom dress shopping with her mother to crying over her first love, Lady Bird’s narrative follows many of the arcs that our younger selves experienced, only with an audacity and drive that we do not always agree with but cannot help admiring.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eAt its core, \u003ci\u003eLady Bird\u003c/i\u003e is a celebration of youth, of being confused and scared and how all of that is perfectly okay. One of the film’s biggest strengths is how relatable Lady Bird’s persona and struggles are - her concerns reflect the anxiety of teenagers who don’t have all of it figured out (i.e. all teenagers). At times, she is fearless, and other points, fearful, but most importantly, she’s still figuring it out. Greta Gerwig understands how actual teenagers work \u0026ndash; Lady Bird is one of the most accurate portrayals of a young woman that I have seen. She is flawed, sometimes to the extent that we do not want to forgive her, but because we resonate so deeply with her journey, we have to. We forgave our younger selves, and we forgive her.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe film focuses largely on Lady Bird’s relationship with her mother, who just doesn’t get it. Films set in high school often neglect parental figures, and I loved how her mother was not comedic relief or merely present. Her mother is always looming, even if it’s unwanted, like how actual parents work. The building tension between the two is so painfully authentic \u0026ndash; you even see yourself in the mother’s shoes, and you wish you treated your parents with more appreciation. The final scene between the two reminds you of how important family is in shaping your identity. You nag and create havoc for them, but ultimately, they are a larger part of you than you realized then.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DYXXm3I64pLA\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YXXm3I64pLA?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eLady Bird\u003c/i\u003e captures so many of the hallmarks of youth: friendship, high school culture, the college search, dirty jokes, prom. It reminds you of how everything felt so big at the time, like how your crush liking you back was somehow so important. The film creates a caricature out of the classmates - the theatre kid, the popular girl, the outsider - all serving as individuals who fade in and out of Lady Bird’s life. They represent the transience of this period, when emotions are heightened and everyone is trying on identities like poorly fit shoes. Lady Bird goes through phases like how we did and possibly still do, and we find comedic relief when she adopts a character that screams short-lived.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThis film reflects so much typical high school turmoil, and it does so with nuance and complexity. Lady Bird allows us to remember the wonders and gripes of youth, bringing up the moments from this period that we will never forget.\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

With all parties involved eager to begin their collaboration, Azor traveled from Palma de Mallorca, Spain, to produce with Cruz in LA back in January 2017. Azor crashed at Cruz’s humble abode for a short two months before flying back to Spain to continue individual work on their project. For his part, Savery composed his music in the Dominican Republic, contributing to the album’s ethnic flare from abroad. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe beginning to each song builds the track as if from a teaser- a single repetitive beat that smoothly escalates into a mind warping, hypnotizing trance. Echoes of subtle tremors in the background make one feel as though they are confined in an unfamiliar space, before emerging into a velvet blanket of epiphany. Every snare, tap, drum, and kick move one to a state of uncertainty to one of clarity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eListen with eyes closed\u0026hellip;the collection mirrors the mind. If the consciousness had a sound, a rhythm, a melody, it would equate to similar sounds of what this multi-national collective produced. I lived at Cruz’s place while Azor was here, and watching their creative process is what essentially drew my immense appreciation for their work. I would wake up to a haze of smoke and a new beat they had only started the night before. Night and day, their eyes were\u003cbr/\u003efixed upon their screens as their fingers were glued to their computers, drum machines and synthesizers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI asked them what their album’s theme was - “I don’t know how to translate this from Spanish, but I guess the whole thing would be a mind-static-ness\u0026hellip;Queríamos llegar a un estado mental de claridad… but more than clarity…a different dimension maybe.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFar too often do I hear the same beat or progression echoing throughout contemporary music. This album’s rarity is what deems it as a true work of art. One can hear sounds from all over the world in a single collection - originality at its finest.\u003c/p\u003e",

Wow, I really regret that decision.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNobody is trusting yo’ brand, Lonzo. I don’t know who the fuck paid for this to happen, but apparently if you got any spare cash laying around you can pay for some mediocre studio time and put together an egregiously lackluster, mind-numbingly boring and goofy sounding mixtape (or half-baked studio album if you really want to call it that). Lord knows even the name of this thing is corny: “Born 2 Ball”. “Born 2 Ball”? Here’s where I would insert a water drop - okay, hand sign and 100 emoji out of pure irony.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe opening track, “Grind On,” starts with the most out of place eagle-soaring-in-high sound effect fresh off of \u003ca href=\"http://soundbible.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esoundbible.com\u003c/a\u003e and probably the most annoying producer tag I’ve heard in the last decade. The main issue I have with this entire project, however, is the fact that Zo himself clearly is not ready to be caught anywhere near a studio booth. The goofy sounding, awkward, broken, uninspiring and no clout having voice that Zo presents all over this thing lacks any sort of charisma, prominence, anger, passion, grit, potency, restraint, growl, honesty, moodiness or any sort of feeling. It is, without a doubt in my mind, going to be the driest presentation of vocals or bars of the year, if not the last decade. Zo sounds insanely goofy, extremely out of place and without an ounce of the amateur charm that someone like Yung Lean might have had a couple years ago starting out. There is nothing about Zo’s character, or “come up” (God forbid I ever have to refer to his coming up as a struggle again) that is remotely intriguing. Ball really believes that he can do anything; putting together a decent rap record is not as easy as a task as some people might believe it to be. This album is forgettable to the core, and falls at the same sins that the overhyped, overrated and fake-deep Jaden Smith album does. Like the “heir to the Smith family fortune,” Lonzo has yet to develop a sound or a personality that is genuine or magnetizing enough to warrant an entire hour of fucking content. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHonestly, please, go through the song “Get Off” and have the spine to tell me that it doesn’t sound like half the faceless and nameless shit on DatPiff. The hook is vomit-enducing…as his “ooo”s and “ahh”s, followed by the “I had to get off”s, stumble over each other like some 14 year old, Atlanta bedroom SoundCloud kid’s most hype creations. He cuts away at his own clout as he speaks about his complete lack of struggle as if it was a struggle, claiming he has never had to flip drugs and never had to throw dice. He throws a light jab at being a Bruin, claiming he doesn’t ride with UCLA when they lose (lol) but I can’t be mad at that, especially when it’s comforting to know his album is so fucking garbage that it essentially disses his own persona. It’s almost as if he’s annoyed that the institution got rid of his crusty little brother, because the shots at the institution continue on the next track, “Z02.” But again, please answer this, what kind of rapper fucking disses a specific institution as if it was some kind of enemy? Only the most privileged and no clout having ass rapper will, that’s who (insert several gun emojis here). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy the time the over-excited, too-much-treble having ass beat on “Puttin in Work” ends, I’m astonished at how forgettable every verse and beat has been thus far. There is not a single moment that warrants a slap in the automobile on this album. If your friends throw one of these tracks on, you officially have 100 percent authority to rip the aux from either the phone plug or the vehicle’s sound system. Aside from this, the features on “Puttin in Work” are the hottest of trash; dumpster fire tier mimicry brought onto the track probably makes this the worst song on the entire album. Zo has the guts to claim that other people are in it for the fame and that everybody is sounding the same, when he has the least iconic sounding voice, delivery, flow, bars and presence of anyone I’ve heard on iTunes this decade. On “Better,” Zo authentically sounds like he’s verbally constipated and pushing the mediocre hook that was prepared for the song onto yet another forgettable beat. “\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLAML” is ultra corny, and the weak yelling on the hook reeks of a Drake influence that should never have materialized into a piece of audio. “You see I made it…You see me skating…Big Baller Brand” - all extremely boring interjections that mean absolutely nothing in a genre where charisma and authenticity and braggadocio are weighed as some of the most important aspects of a rapper’s presentation and worth. Zo’s incessant references to “Triple B’s” are, lowkey, annoying; And while I understand that having a company or brand must be a fulfilling experience, one has to remember that the cultural prominence of the entire BBB company is for the fucking memes. Are we taking this as seriously as other brands that are mentioned boringly on the next SoundCloud rapper’s tracks? No. Are we taking BBB as the next big Nike cultural giant? (or culturally predatory giant, however you wanna see it) No. Stop trying to force this down our throats, b. You’re corny. This is corny. Me reviewing this is corny. If you would not have recorded this maybe the Lakers would be in a better position right now. Please, for the love of all that is holy, stay on the court, bro. Keep your shit talking on the court. Keep it out of our playlists. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e1/10\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eFavorite Track: \u003c/b\u003eWhen I turned this shit off and went to go listen to Nipsey Hussle’s “Victory Lap” instead\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/7iazAX1vFHINDjamTG5nQW\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e",

I don’t have a safety net; it’s all in.” \u0026ndash; G-Eazy\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor any musician, music is often as natural and second nature as channeling the melody that courses through their bloodstream and harnessing the beat that is as continuous as their own pulse. But for a true artist, it’s all about escaping the body of norms, embracing the opportunity to disrupt what’s already established, and shattering safety in order to piece together something truly revolutionary.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a few words, a true artist knows no limits. For G-Eazy, it’s a no-brainer. Like his lead track, “No Limit,” which features A$AP Rocky and Cardi B and has been streamed over 183 million times on Spotify, his bold, uncompromising message and colorful music is all about no holding back. His newest album, \u003ci\u003eThe Beautiful \u0026amp; Damned\u003c/i\u003e is just as risque, daring, and no-balls as the life philosophy he lives by. His attitude is a reflection of just that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis daring, progressive, and experimental mindset is what sets G-Eazy apart from many artists. The position that G-Eazy finds himself in is not simply one where he doesn’t have a plan B. It’s titles like “Favorite Hip-Hop Artist” at the 2017 People’s Choice Awards, Forbes’ 30 Under 30, and most recently, Co-Creative Director role of Stillhouse Spirits Co. It’s two years of selling out shows worldwide and releasing singles alongside timeless artists like Snoop Dogg and Kehlani.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost importantly, the same fearless, raw, and carefree attitude that makes his music impactful is the same attitude that always keeps the listener on edge and hanging onto his every lyric. \u003ci\u003eThe Beautiful \u0026amp; Damned\u003c/i\u003e is a more personal, intimate glimpse into the artist’s personal life and perspective, one that carefully and rigorously combines the audacious “fuck everything” persona with his deeply thoughtful, reflective and often political insights. It addresses fame, money, as well as the duality of good and evil in following the path of notoriety, and includes highly anticipated collaborations with artists like Halsey, Charlie Puth, and Son Lux. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis tour includes the lineup of Phora, Trippie Redd, Anthony Russo. Sometimes, Plan A is all you need. With \u003ci\u003eThe Beautiful \u0026amp; Damned\u003c/i\u003e, it’s all in.\u003c/p\u003e",

With Robin Hannibal leaving the once duo, this new album was primarily written by Milosh.\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSimilar to the debut album \u003ci\u003eWoman\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003eBlood\u003c/i\u003e is a sensual piece, filled with texture, emotive string instruments, and a strong beat. Unlike Woman, however, \u003ci\u003eBlood \u003c/i\u003elacks the raw sexiness that made Rhye so powerful. It mimics some aspects that made their older music so enchanting - smooth vocals and groovy beats - yet by not committing enough to these characteristics, the music falls flat. \u003ci\u003eWoman \u003c/i\u003eexuded intimacy and hot flashes of first love. \u003ci\u003eBlood\u003c/i\u003e pursues the same vulnerability, yet it loses the heart of the original.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRhye is all about sex: romantic, candle-lit, making love sex. This stems from Milosh’s silky, fragile vocals to even the nudity of the album covers. Yet \u003ci\u003eBlood\u003c/i\u003e is barely provocative; it incorporates all the elements of so-called “sexy” music, yet does not take any risks, and in its uniformity, becomes boring. It feels like a formula, devoid of the lust it seeks to evoke.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMilosh’s breathy, nuanced voice is the most notable parallel in every Rhye song. This is his terrain, creating a delicate mood with his feminine singing. While this in itself was unable to carry the entire album, it gave the tracks a particular allure, an invitation to continue listening, an answer to some of the questions \u003ci\u003eWoman\u003c/i\u003e asked about the longevity of love.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA couple standout tracks include “Taste,” about the healing nature of his love’s loyalty, and “Phoenix,” a warning that his relationship harms his mental health. The rhythm in “Taste” keeps the song engaging, as the listener hears Milosh reflect on his appreciation for his new love, a groovy homage to giving love a second chance. In “Phoenix,” the magic of Milosh’s gentle voice is the most apparent - sweet, biting, and deliberate. He fears for the impermanence of love, and this confession, the reality of many relationships, feels jarring to us too. We can feel his concern for what is to come.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYet despite these songs, the album does not feel purposeful. \u003ci\u003eBlood\u003c/i\u003e is overproduced, lacking the authenticity and tenderness that I had wanted from this piece. The elements from \u003ci\u003eWoman \u003c/i\u003ethat \u003ci\u003eBlood\u003c/i\u003e mirrored kept the Rhye “sound” succinct, yet these new tracks do not have the intrigue that makes me want to continue listening. \u003ci\u003eBlood\u003c/i\u003e is mildly catchy but did not capture my attention. \u003ci\u003eBlood\u003c/i\u003e is a diluted \u003ci\u003eWoman\u003c/i\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost of the songs from \u003ci\u003eBlood\u003c/i\u003e blur together, to the extent where I cannot distinguish the tracks. While it’s natural for songs on an album to have a particular style, the songs on \u003ci\u003eBlood\u003c/i\u003e feel similar due to how tame each track feels on its own.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wanted seduction. I wanted breathlessness. I wanted sincerity. \u003ci\u003eBlood\u003c/i\u003e only moderately fulfilled these expectations. Rhye’s sophomore album is worth a listen or two, but it does not have the charm of a staple album.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dd_UYh0lnN3Y\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_UYh0lnN3Y?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePart Two - Written by Anshu Patel\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMilosh exudes “I make love, I don’t fuck” vibes; it’s established that Rhye is music to have sex to. The project’s dedication to mood is so strong strong that Milosh actually asked KCRW to turn off the lights during an in-station performance so he could instead sing by candlelight. The group has always been unintentionally mysterious and resigned \u0026ndash; Rhye made an inconspicuous debut in 2012 with the release of “Open,” a single that later appeared on the highly acclaimed album \u003ci\u003eWoman\u003c/i\u003e. Producer and songwriter Robin Hannibal has since left the project, metamorphosing Rhye into more of a musical collective. It’s no surprise that the announcement of an upcoming album caused much anticipation; \u003ci\u003eBlood\u003c/i\u003e was finally released this past week. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRhye’s luxurious sensuality is still hypnotizing, with every track encapsulating their seductive sound. Milosh’s gentle croon gives the record a sense of cohesion. Essential tracks from the release include “Stay Safe,” “Taste,” and “Count to Five.” The synth beat in “Sinful” resembles the soft alien noises that are whispered during hearing exams, an interesting variation on their usual sound. Songs do begin to melt into each other in some places on the record, to the point where it’s very difficult to distinguish one from another. “Blood Knows” and “Waste” become forgettable without a distinctive beat layered under Milosh’s smooth vocals. I wouldn’t say that Rhye has fallen into a sophomore slump, as their powerful, alluring sound permeates the album, but it is clear that their debut was a much stronger collection than \u003ci\u003eBlood\u003c/i\u003e. Milosh claims that he wanted to make an album that translated better into live music, but the record has suffered slightly as a result. Additionally, the themes touched upon in their music are almost hollowed by the album and single artwork - what could be a beautiful exploration of physical love becomes an obsession with the female form, faces are hidden and bodies are warped into highly sexualized positions. \u003ci\u003eBlood\u003c/i\u003e is a gorgeous, albeit flawed record, leaving the listener wanting just a bit more. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/6yoGOJsTjU7w2amKcUUX7S\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e",

Silhouettes of gummy bears flash on retro TV screens lining the walls. Pulsing lights break the darkness of the club to reveal BlackGummy prepping to take over from Monstergetdown. These are not the type of DJs to tell you to “f**ckin jump.” The handoff from Monstergetdown to BlackGummy would have gone unnoticed to the causal listener. BlackGummy starts the set with “Adapative Radiation,”\u003ci\u003e \u003c/i\u003eone of his signature tracks. The thumping baseline and melody instantly elevates the crowd to a new level. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBlackGummy’s sound is hypnotic, ethereal and satisfyingly filthy. His mastery of dark, progressive house and techno captures the minds and feet of everyone in ear’s reach. The name “BlackGummy” is fitting. BlackGummy embodies his monstrous caricature by filling the dance floor with enormous bass lines and ominously hypnotic melodies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo borrow a term from Anakim, BlackGummy’s flavor of progressive house and techno takes you to \u003ci\u003edeep space. \u003c/i\u003eEverything is dark, and you certainly aren’t on Earth. He successfully took the entire dance floor to another dimension. The same is true for any club where BlackGummy lands. And he’ll do it again and again. This is not a show you want to miss. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBlackGummy continued to captivate the dance floor for two hours. Track after track was full of banging techno. The darkness of the club only broke when the enveloping lights pulse across the dance floor. The set ended with his own remix of \u003ci\u003eStrobe\u003c/i\u003e from mau5trap’s godfather and creator, deadmau5.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis was the start (precursor) of BlackGummy’s \u003ci\u003eMesophase\u003c/i\u003e tour. He’ll be touring around the US through early April.

If you are a fan of techno, progressive house, tech house, or honestly any electronic music, this show is for you. You’ll be transported to a dark, melodic state for hours and the catharsis of the dance floor will leave you buzzing for days. See you out in deep space.\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten by Natalie Benudiz\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\nAlright boys and girls, strap yourselves the fuck in: this was the concert to end all concerts. It feels unfair to be so limited by language in trying to communicate the sheer epicness of what I witnessed on December 30. The dudes sold out three damn nights for a New Years Eve run to close out 2017 at Thalia Hall in Chicago, joining forces with Dehd and Post Animal for the Saturday night show. This performance was truly Twin Peaks at their… peak.\u003cbr/\u003eThe evening began with a performance from the band Dehd, a Chicago based post punk trio. Though the name sounds edgy, their sound was surprisingly upbeat. They delivered a decent set, but the audience’s anticipation for the following bands was painfully obvious in their indifferent restlessness, eclipsing the performance. \u003cbr/\u003eWhen Post Animal took the stage shortly after, the mood shifted almost instantly. Their distinct blend of Cream, Tame Impala, and Black Sabbath influences incited headbanging, crowdsurfing, and moshing, setting the tone for the rest of the night. By the time they had finished their set, I had already accumulated a sweet collection of bruises. As they came to the last song of their performance, they did the one thing that finally pushed the audience to the point of delirium: they brought out Joe Keery (Steve from \u003ci\u003eStranger Things\u003c/i\u003e). At this point, I can confidently say that I lost my shit. Though he hasn’t played a show with the band in months, Joe and his luscious head of hair shredded for one song before ducking back to the safety of the side stage. Speaking of hair, every other member of the band also had some bitchin’ hair, which is essential if you’re going to be headbanging as hard as Post Animal does. They’re definitely a band to see if you’re into the possibility of giving yourself an aneurysm during a show (which actually happened to Javi Reyes onstage a few weeks ago). Just when it seemed that there were no surprises left, Jack Dolan of Twin Peaks darted out from backstage to jump into the crowd during Post Animal’s last song, teasing the audience. \u003cbr/\u003eOkay kids, make sure those seat belts are buckled nice and tight, because this is where shit really gets rowdy. When the dudes finally took the stage and blasted into “Strawberry Smoothie,” the audience lost whatever chill they had left: bodies immediately went over the barricade, beer cans went flying, and a mosh pit opened up into a swirling vortex of thrashing limbs. The stage was equally as chaotic, with Cadien Lake James whipping his head back and forth and Clay Frankel thrashing on his white teardrop guitar and jumping around. By the third song, a girl in a red felt cowboy hat had already broken the nose of the poor dude standing next to her. At some point south of “Have You Ever,” a bra flew onstage from somewhere near the barricade, but it didn’t remain there for long. By the next song, the owner of the bra crowdsurfed onto the stage to personally retrieve the bra from Frankel, who responded with a confused remark of “Uh.. she wants her bra back.. I’m not sure what to say about that.” I literally cannot make this up.  \u003cbr/\u003eIn the midst of the absolute chaos in the pit, it would have been easy to miss the extra members onstage. Accompanying Colin Croom, \n\nConnor Brodner, Frankel, JD, and James were three horns and three backup singers. Though their presence in the background seemed a little out of place, the layer of sophistication they provided served as a delicious contrast to the shouted lyrics. Twin Peaks is one of those rare bands that actually sound better live - the boys somehow harmonize their screamed lyrics (I wonder if they ever lose their voices). This was especially evident in “Wanted You,” “Butterfly,” and “Walk to the One You Love.” (FYI: the set list is below! ur welcome.) The screaming took a backseat near the middle of their set when Frankel brought out his roommate, Marisa Nakamura, to sing “Shake Your Lonely.” The cute duet was a brief moment of relief from the headbanging and moshing, which picked right back up again at “Have You Ever,” continuing all the way to the last song in the set, “Butterfly.” But what’s a show without a shirtless Frankel and a gigantic confetti cannon to close out the encore? Not a Twin Peaks show, that’s for damn sure. The encore featured four gems - “Heavenly Showers,” “Blue Coupe,” “We Will Not Make It,” and “Boomers.”\u003cbr/\u003eOn the real, this show was so good that I spent an obscene amount of money to do it all over again on NYE. I think what makes a Twin Peaks show a Twin Peaks show is the excitement of its sheer unpredictability: will you crowd surf? Will there be a riot? Will you do drugs? Who knows! (You’ll probably do all these things.) It’s like a rollercoaster of hysteria that you never want to get off. Chicago, you truly know how to get down. \u003cbr/\u003eIf you haven’t listened to their new compilation of singles, stop reading this right now and go listen. And if you have, do NOT miss out on their only LA gig at Air and Style in March. It’s been a hot minute since they were here; they are notorious for their fierce loyalty to Chicago and the Midwest in general, so it is extremely rare that they’re playing in LA. Spend the money. Hell, spend someone else’s money. Do whatever you gotta do to get a ticket, because this is a once in a lifetime band. I’m begging you, go see them. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eSet List\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStrawberry Smoothie\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFast Eddie\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGot Your Money\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSloop Jay D\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHolding Roses\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGetting Better\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWalk To The One You Love\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShake Your Lonely\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHave You Ever?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKeep It Together\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSweet Thing\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFlavor\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaking Breakfast\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn The Meadow\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTossing Tears\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWanted You\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eButterfly\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEncore\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHeavenly Showers\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBlue Coupe\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe Will Not Make It\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoomers\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "How TV Screwed Up Selection Sunday",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten by Spencer Weissman\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSelection Sunday is supposed to be the kickoff to the most intense thrill ride of college basketball season. The point of the show is to build excitement for the next three weeks of college basketball. It is supposed to be the quick taste to the madness that will ensue. However, over the last few years, the coverage of the selection show has fallen off. At 6 ET and 3 PT, everyone gathers around their TV as the brackets are released. For most, we are most curious to see the seeding, the region, and the date of our teams first game. For people like me, that first Thursday and Friday is a lost day of school. It is my favorite sports weekend of the year. But it all begins with the selection show.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhere they went wrong?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt used to be that the Selection Show lasted around 30 minutes as the regions were announced and the teams in them were promptly announced. Over time it has become a more drawn out process as making teams sweat out their seed and the bubble teams more uneasy. When the concept of the First 4 Games in Dayton began is when the show moved to around two hours. Many college basketball fans have complained this a dumb set up as we just want the bracket out as fast as possible. However, this year they are going about it a whole new way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe New Way of Announcing\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eRather than introducing the brackets, TBS is starting off the show announcing the 68 teams in the field. Around 60 teams that make the tournament are all a given come Selection Sunday. The main attraction of the day is going to what region you are in and who you face. By doing it this way, it drags out a show that is already too long. In addition, for the bubble teams that do get in, you still do not know your seed and whether you are in Dayton for a First 4 Game. Most fans like myself remember the best year in recent years of Selection Show came when the bracket was leaked early.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Solution\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eGo back to what has worked in the past. Make the Selection Sunday Show just 30 minutes. The “bracketologist” is almost 95 percent accurate with the teams that make the field, so that is no longer as pressing. Where the fans truly care is finding out the regions, game dates, and match ups. All of that can be done in 30 minutes like it was in the past. As a fan, I do not need to hear Charles Barkley comment on any team for more than 30 seconds. It just is not as enjoyable as getting the bracket out as early as possible and being able to make my picks. \u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "The “One and Done” Rule",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten by Spencer Weissman \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe “one and done” rule have come under a lot of scrutiny in recent weeks. The one and done rule have been a polarizing rule ever since it was implemented by the NBA. When it was introduced, no one expected the grand effect it would have. One and done players, though, have become the primary talk of college basketball over the last decade. However, I believe that it needs to stay. What people do not realize about the one and done rule is that it offers players a unique opportunity to receive a college degree even if they leave school early. Most people would agree that the players deserve to be paid, but determining that is very difficult. The solution of the NBA eliminating the one and done rule, though, is not the right answer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlayers who have been one and done are Anthony Bennett, Greg Oden, Xavier Henry, Josh Selby, Johnny Flynn, and many more. What all of these guys have in common is that their NBA careers did not go as planned. But by going to college for that one year, they had the opportunity to go back and pursue their degree on their own terms. By creating this rule, the NBA allowed the opportunity for these men to, rather than go straight to the draft and then flop as players, go to school after their careers on a full scholarship and get degrees. By giving these men the opportunity to eventually earn degrees, a new career path is created after their playing careers. In addition, players can go whenever to finish their college degree. So, for a player like Anthony Davis, for example, once he decides to hang up his sneakers for good, he can go back to Kentucky and complete his degree. A player who flopped in the NBA but does not have this opportunity is someone like James Lang. Lang skipped a year of college and instead went straight to the NBA draft. If given the option of going to college to play basketball, it can be assumed someone like Lang would take that opportunity. By having these kids, even if it is just for a year, at college before going to the NBA, it can change their lives in the long term.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMark Emmert,the president of the NCAA, has said he doesn’t want players to go to play college ball if they are only there just to get to the NBA. I strongly disagree with his take. The one and done player has not only improved the product, but also sometimes come back for a second year that was not originally planned. A prime example of a player who came back for a second year that no one expected to and who then improved his draft stock and took the next step is Russell Westbrook. After his freshman year, Westbrook truly needed that second year to take the next step as a player. By encouraging the one and done players, guys like Westbrook ended up staying a second year at school. The one and done rule has done more to help these players then hurt them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am not saying the players should not be paid. The players should be paid, and most are under the table. The NCAA has been called the most corrupt system for a reason. Eventually, they will figure it out (I hope.) But eliminating the one and done rule is not a solution to the problem, as most of the players who enter into the NBA draft flame out. \u003c/p\u003e",

But it’s been really busy because we’re about to embark on this US tour, so I’m sort of on emails every second. But, I’m so excited! To tour in LA, of course, and all around the country.

Coming out April 20 y’all! Put it on your calendar. Big things are happening for you! “Somebody That I Used to Know” hit 1 Billion and 200,000+ views on YouTube! The idea of 1 billion people in general is mind boggling, but so many souls have listened to your craft. You are about to touch a bunch on your tour! I will be seeing you in LA on Valentines Day at the Ace Hotel! Los Angeles, get your tickets! Don’t miss out. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDJ Spamela:\u003c/b\u003e What is one piece of advice you would give to young artists out there who aspire to be like you one day? Especially young female artists who want to get into the producing business and music industry, because you yourself produce so much of your songs! Because there isn’t female visibility in the industry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKimbra:\u003c/b\u003e Yeah I absolutely agree. There’s a lot of advice I could give, but maybe one really big one is kind of building the confidence to share your craft with people and actually ask for help. You know, I think that sometimes as women, unfortunately, we don’t put ourselves out there and say, “Look! I’m learning this thing. And I really would love some help.” You could ask around and say, “Do you think you could come over to my house and tomorrow we could learn Able-ton? Or could you teach me how to be able to work at a time-signature when I’m listening to a song?” So you can learn the vocabulary to be a producer or an artist. And it can help to have so many mentors in your life to continue to guide you and teach you. I try to put myself out there a lot and if I meet someone that I have a connection with, I ask for their email and suggest if I could send them something. And I think that can go a long way. Especially with the age of the internet, with everyone being so accessible now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5503\" data-orig-height=\"3244\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d59dc9234a42fa815804aba1428303eb/tumblr_inline_p4s3lqcyfK1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5503\" data-orig-height=\"3244\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDJ Spamela\u003c/b\u003e: So I know you’ve delayed the release to truly commit to your artistic vision. This makes it that much more exciting for your fans. Plus, I love it when my favorite artists truly commit to the idea of a whole album rather than just radio hits they chug out all the time. Listening to an album from top to bottom is SUCH an experience and form of art. What are you personally most excited about with this album and how do you think it differs from your previous albums?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKimbra: \u003c/b\u003eYeah, well I think every album I make is a reaction to what I’ve done before. The last album I made in LA, called \u003ci\u003eGolden Echo\u003c/i\u003e. I kind of lived in this world of imagination and it was very psychedelic. I’ve gotten so many people to help me and it was a really important record for me to kind of celebrate a lot of music I love. It was wild and encompassed everything in my mind. But with this record, since moving to New York. I feel like I’ve become level-grounded as a person and I’m a lot more focused. I’m ready to share some of my pain as well. Some things that are closer to my heart, its a lot more confrontational and bold. Instead of escaping from reality, I think that I’m more grounded to reality on this record. But still, highly imaginative and colorful, that’s always going to be a part of what I do. But, I think that, I don’t know it’s a maturity thing. I think I’m learning to be more personable with my work and it is quite liberating. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDJ Spamela:\u003c/b\u003e That’s really beautiful. It’s your peaceful purgatory where you’re in the middle of your fantasy and reality world into one beautiful landscape. Which is why your fans love your work. I personally feel like I’m always in your world and transcend it to all parts of my life listening to your album from top to bottom. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKimbra:\u003c/b\u003e Ah! I agree, I love that. That’s great. I’m glad that you see the importance of an album from top to bottom. I like a narrative and I promise \u003ci\u003ePrimal Heart\u003c/i\u003e will be the same.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"6000\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c674a0c4833062d598da7da6fb7d5f2c/tumblr_inline_p4s3qaSxxV1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"6000\" data-orig-height=\"4000\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDJ Spamela:\u003c/b\u003e Do you have any favorite albums that you use as inspiration?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKimbra: \u003c/b\u003eYeah! There’s so many. I’m a big fan of a lot of prog/rock bands. They’re very good at designing a cinematic arc. Even indie bands I listened to in high school like Interpol. I still listen to those albums and think, wow, they really made a lot of choices on this record. Definitely Radiohead for full-length albums. They say such interesting stories in their records, like Rainbows. But, there are definitely a lot more records I love and stick out to me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDJ Spamela:\u003c/b\u003e I know you mentioned bringing some personal pain into this record, but what makes you feel like you’re on “Top of the World” these days in honor of your new single that just came out, “Top of the World!” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKimbra:\u003c/b\u003e Hahahahahahaha. Oh, let’s see. I would say that I do get a real high when I’m on stage performing for people. I’m actually kinda shy out sometimes in the real world, and I’m like every person in the world. I’m 27, I have insecurities and I have fear. And I have all these things that we’re all coping with. I feel like it’s such a God given gift to be able to be on stage. And I feel like that so much of that fear and self-conscious just goes. I feel like I can channel something greater than me and I feel like I can do anything you know? It’s kind of beautiful. It’s a really special feeling for me to be able to sing, create, and it truly gives me a real high. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDJ Spamela:\u003c/b\u003e Thank you for your time. Have an amazing, prosperous, fulfilling, and positive day Kimbra. It was such a pleasure and honor to talk to you. I’ll leave you to your Indian curry and I’ll see you in Los Angeles!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eKimbra:\u003c/b\u003e Ah of course, it was so lovely to chat with you.

I have personally been listening to this band since 2016 when I first discovered their song “South Side” off their \u003ci\u003eCold Shower\u003c/i\u003e EP. I instantly loved Triathalon’s dreamy, bedroom-synth sound. Although their sound is very much influenced by current lo-fi-sythy-dream bedroom pop music mixed with some slow jazzy beats and mellow/groovy deep bass riffs, I have still been happily listen to everything they’ve been putting out through the years. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe new album itself is not the most extraordinary musical production ever; It has a few catchy tunes with some groovy beats. Their sound is very much the same in comparison to their past albums, but a bit more upbeat. My favorite song off their newest album is “Bad Mood”. They first released this song in 2016 on a various artist album called \u003ci\u003eEverything Melts Eventually, Vol. II\u003c/i\u003e. The version that was released off the 2016 album is much more stripped and slowed down, adding a cooler and unique sound. The newer version on \u003ci\u003eOnline \u003c/i\u003eis much more upbeat, and contains less of the reverb effects that gave the sum so much more character on the original version. Although I prefer the original rendition of the song, I still very much enjoy the track and consider it one of my favorites, along with the song “True.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1365\" data-orig-width=\"2048\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0e3eeab5620bf6a47cfc6f2e20cb460f/tumblr_inline_p4mlwdV2Xc1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1365\" data-orig-width=\"2048\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eTriathalon in the UCLA Radio Station (2/13/18).\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe closing song off the album is “True” and has a completely different theme and sound from all the other songs they’ve composed. This song almost seems to be influenced by early 2000s Usher, Lil Wayne, Kanye sort of R\u0026amp;B, along with current bedroom-pop sound. I really love this song and wish they would’ve created more songs with this sound. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, the album is super chill and easy to listen to. Although it isn’t the most unique album out, it definitely carries itself with the majority of well composed and lyrically significant synthy tunes. I am happy this band is growing and creating more music that sounds so effortless and relaxing, yet contains so many elements that overlay and complement one another. I would definitely recommend this album along with their projects as well! \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/7gHhzCEFOlx7u2mVlOrCOp\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e",

Joined by childhood friend Carson McKee, the singer-songwriter duo’s six-song EP is their first collective release in nearly five years. On the whole, \u003ci\u003eFools\u003c/i\u003e is a delightful blend of Americana, folk, and bluegrass that demonstrates musical and lyrical maturity previously unheard from Turner and McKee.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the average listener, the album starts strong. For the listener who has followed Turner’s YouTube channel for years on end, this is a polished throwback to a cherished Other Favorites video released in 2015, so I would say it starts \u003ci\u003every\u003c/i\u003e strong. “The Levee” not only introduces the listener to McKee’s dulcet tones and Turner’s impressive virtuosity, but also lays ground for a six-song demonstration of strong songwriting. One encounters a gentle ebb and flow as they press on to the next few songs, gliding from uptempo bluegrass jams, down to soft folk ballads, and back up once more. The thoughtfulness of its track organization contributes an immense amount to the enjoyability of this project, however, the hard-hitting lyrical content and thought-provoking chords (see “Angelina”) make this more than just another drop in the bucket of uninspired folk albums.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D6bf_VTQ72hU\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6bf_VTQ72hU?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\nIt’s a fine line that I walk on when I write for the uninitiated listener, the line between being an impartial reviewer and a fanboy. I should be hesitant to give this EP such a favorable review, but it should be no surprise that one doles out praise more readily to music that better suits their tastes. So I speak to those of you whose tastes are suited by minimalist Americana/bluegrass music: \u003ci\u003eFools\u003c/i\u003e is a record worth 20 minutes of your time.\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2Y2tMqcDVU2oMatek9xEP4\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e",

Midterms are over. You’re dancing to Phoenix because you’ve just realized you actually like them. In the distance, skateboarders. I’m two months behind on this meme, but just roll with it because it’s exactly what you should be doing in two weeks at Air and Style.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDon’t show up in a flower crown, because this year’s Air and Style defies the paradigm of disappointing lineups and mainstream pop giants. Wear whatever you want, because you’re not going for the scene - you’re going for the diverse range of acts that have already proven their musical prowess. Of the 20 bands stacked on this lineup, here’s the quick and dirty guide to the five artists that need to be your priority. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e1. Phoenix\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey’re the Taylor Swift of the alt-rock world, and this isn’t even a pleasure to feel guilty about. Their colorful, glossy melodies are familiar yet pleasant. It’s shimmery, it’s fruity, it’s just fun; they sound the way champagne tastes, so drink up. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTracks to check out before the festival: “Rome,” “Ti Amo,”and “Trying To Be Cool.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e2. Mura Masa\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re still bitter about missing him at Bruin Bash because CEC can’t get their shit together when it comes to ticketing systems, now is your chance! Honestly, though, I rolled my eyes at yet another electro-producer-beat-whatever. When I decided to sit down and give Mura Masa a try, I finally understood the hype. It’s undeniably dancy with just the right amount of funky, and it would be hard not to have a good time dancing around to this in a crowd of 5,000 of your best friends.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTracks to check out before the festival: “What if I Go?” “\u0026hellip;Girl” and “Firefly.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e3. Washed Out\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e It’s summer somewhere in Europe and you’re at a kickback in a beach villa belonging to someone you’ve never met. Wait, no, you’re in the middle of DTLA at a music and snowboarding festival? In reality, you’re taking a breather in between sets from the smorgasbord of different genres. Washed Out’s chill, exotic vibes will cleanse your palate after headbanging yourself into oblivion at together PANGEA.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTracks to check out before the festival: “Hard to Say Goodbye” and “It Feels Alright.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e4. together PANGEA\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e Though they’ve been around since 2008, every time I see them it’s as if I’m listening for the first time. As artists, their strength lies in their ability to take angst and transform it into clean melodies that leave a sweet-and-sour taste in your mouth, making you beg for more catchy choruses. Their sunny garage punk vibe perfectly compliments the rambunctiousness of Twin Peaks, and I really wouldn’t be surprised if they teamed up for a song or two during the festival. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTracks to check out before the festival: “Badillac” (it’s a BANGER), “Money On It,” and “River.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e5. Twin Peaks\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe last time Twin Peaks played on the West Coast, I was still getting A’s in my GEs. If anything, you should be going to this festival just to see boy-wonder Clay Frankel in the flesh. Otherwise, you should be going to their set to experience the madness of a Twin Peaks show. Their garage-Rolling Stones sound is a pure shot of adrenaline into your ear that you feel through your whole body. Catch me at their set crowd surfing away from all my problems. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTracks to check out before the festival: “Butterfly,” “Mirror of Time,” and “Flavor.”(Read what happened at the last Twin Peaks concert \u003ca href=\"http://blog.uclaradio.com/post/169375566357/twin-peaks-thalia-hall-12302017-show\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo close, let me hit you with some math, because school is in session: \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1 Air and Style ticket = $149\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e20 shows = 1 A+S ticket\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e$149 = 20 shows\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1 show = $7.45\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLESS THAN $10 PER PERFORMANCE IS CHEAPER THAN FAT SAL’S.

If you’re headed up there this Memorial Day weekend, don’t stick to what you know. Branch out and embrace all of what LiB has to offer! Here is a list of ten performances from all types of genres that you should pencil into your schedule this year\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eZhu\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s kick off this list with a crowd favorite, Zhu. Steven Zhu has cemented himself as one of the best and relatively new producers in the electronic music world. If you haven’t heard of him yet, get to know him. With collaborations from Ekali to Skrillex, Zhu has proved to his fans that he is as versatile as he is unique. His performances are much more than just incredible music, combining dark cinematic themes with surreal visual effects. Zhu is also one of the most popular Asian-American artists paving the way for a new generation of electronic producers, highlighting diversity and breaking free from the mold of what it means to be a DJ. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Glitch Mob\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eGlitch Mob is probably the most traditional “LiB” artist on this list. They’re likely to play a closing set this year, so get ready to see people dancing on speakers, twirling neon hula-hoops and losing their minds to the distinctive sound of the one and only “Glitch Mob.” With a fantastic blend of hip hop influences and thumping electronic rhythms, the Glitch Mob will perform one unforgettable set. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eNAO\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eNeed a break from the constant pounding bass? I probably won’t, but I’m still extremely excited to catch NAO at LiB this year. You’ve probably heard the song “Firefly” by our Grammy nominated Bruin Bash alumni, Mura Masa. Well, that’s NAO’s voice on that hit song! NAO is a talented vocalist with a refreshing new take on modern RnB. Her phenomenal production value paired with her unique voice will make for one powerful performance. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMK\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eMartin Kinchen, professionally known as MK, has been hitting the decks since the 90’s. Even though he’s been a staple in house music for decades, he’s showing no sign of slowing down. His recent release, “17,” currently number one in the UK dance charts, proves that his sound is timeless and universal. Step back in time to experience some real house music with MK at LiB this year!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eThe Black Madonna\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Black Madonna is proving to the world that a DJ is a true artist. Her sets are dynamic, seamless and incredibly diverse, pulling from countless genres from disco to techno. I guarantee you will dance your a** off at the Black Madonna. Her sets are straight up parties, where you will find her fans belting along to classic house anthems or getting down to a song you’ve never heard before. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eKRANE\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor those who are craving some trap during their weekend at Lightning in a Bottle, head on over to KRANE’s set and get your fill. He’s actually performed at UCLA before last year at the Brownies and Lemonade event. If you missed him then, don’t miss him again! His sets are fueled with high energy remixes and hard hitting drops, so let’s get headbanging!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSango\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of my personal favorites, Sango, combines Brazilian sounds with American trap inspired beats. His songs are layered and complex and have an impressive track record of collabs from Goldlink to TaKu. Soulection’s Sango will provide a fun yet thoughtful and unique set. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eYokoO\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eTransport yourself to Burning Man with ethereal and atmospheric vibes from globe-trotter YokoO. Close your eyes and dance around as YokoO takes you on a musical journey through time and space. For those of you that want a taste of the desert at LiB, make sure you check out YokoO. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWalker \u0026amp; Royce\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eComing off a recent sold-out show at Sound Nightclub, it just felt right to include Dirtybird boys Walker \u0026amp; Royce on this list. They are the masterminds behind the tech-house crowd favorite “Take Me To Your Leader,” and it will be impossible to stand still at Walker \u0026amp; Royce’s set!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBleep Bloop\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Bleep Bloop? What kind of name is Bleep Bloop?” you might ask. At least, that’s what I asked when he performed at LiB back in 2016. The whimsical name was intriguing to me, and I was pleasantly surprised that I convinced my friends to come check him out with me. His sound is definitely not your typical electronic set, as he plays most of his own music with a heavy emphasis on computer noises. Whether you enjoy it or not, you won’t experience anything quite like Bleep Bloop! \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLightning in a Bottle 2018 might be the best lineup they’ve ever had. Besides Anderson .Paak, there are many other must-see acts that will be performing this Memorial Day weekend. Who are you most excited to see? Also, if you haven’t gotten your tickets yet, they are on sale NOW! Get them \u003ca href=\"http://lightninginabottle.org/tickets/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e and get stoked! \u003c/p\u003e",

I look at my beautiful friend as we dance to the tune, smiles plastered on our faces. This is our celebration of youth, our anthem for reckless abandon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEver since I went to my first concert two years ago, I\u0026rsquo;ve been addicted to the movement of live music, how it puts you in that late night vulnerability. I always end up swapping secrets with the friends who go with me. The collective energy of the crowd shamelessly singing off-key. The timeless magic of dancing to your favorite songs in person.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt my last concert, I remember my friend Claire grinning, \u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t know how much I needed this.\u0026rdquo; Hearing that opening song, I realized that I did. We both sought to forget all the petty worries we normally obsess over. We wanted hair tangled, sweat sticking to our skin, boundless silliness. We wanted to dance until we were dumb.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBesides forgoing all the mundane problems, concerts are about remembering. Seeing just how booming and vibrant life can be. Live music forces me to look at all the small wonders through a magnifying glass. And then, I become the girl with this big, silly smile on her face like she\u0026rsquo;s fearless. Present. Things might not always be okay, but this moment is hers. No one can take that away.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m at a Capital Cities concert. I\u0026rsquo;m screaming the lyrics and dancing with an energy usually meant for solo dance parties in my room. A man approaches me: \u0026ldquo;Oh my god, I love your enthusiasm. You\u0026rsquo;re awesome,\u0026rdquo; and we high-five. I beam back at him. As I reflect on the night, I know this is what I want to be: larger than life, unapologetic, free. His words are a small token for my shamelessness, and I let myself live audaciously. I let myself take up space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you strip back all the expectations, who we are becomes fuzzy. I\u0026rsquo;m a passionate writer. Asian American. But I\u0026rsquo;m also a girl who likes taking pictures of her friends, eating chili lime potato chips, and writing long emails. Die-hard romantic. Concert enthusiast. Self-proclaimed philosopher of existential questions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe spend so much timing trying to become who we should be rather than letting who we are flourish. Live music has given me the push to seek authenticity. When I\u0026rsquo;m carelessly singing to my favorite songs with my best friends, I do not have to fulfill anyone\u0026rsquo;s assumptions. I\u0026rsquo;m no longer the crazy best friend. I\u0026rsquo;m just me, with all of my contradictions and idiosyncrasies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSometimes, all you need is something as simple as live music to find yourself. I\u0026rsquo;m always going to overthink situations and obsess over details, but for this one night, for these few songs, I am electric. I\u0026rsquo;m filling the present with gorgeous melody and joy and spirit. I don\u0026rsquo;t know all the answers, but that\u0026rsquo;s okay, as long as I\u0026rsquo;m still asking questions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut there is something that I do know, with all the certainty in my heart: In this moment, despite all the hurt and turbulence in the world, I am happy.\u003c/p\u003e",

Alvarez is the lead singer, composer, and founder of El Haragán y Compañía. Alvarez is most known for his lyrics that reflect the cultural reality of Mexico. He is known as a social portraitist for the vivid narrative of his songs. El Haragán y Compañía  are currently on their “Revolution 27\u0026quot; tour across the United States. I interviewed him at a venue in Los Angeles for his performance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eIrlanda:\u003c/b\u003e Buenas noches estan escuchando UCLA Radio con DJ Yoli aquí estoy con el Haragan.

Recuerdas, con los afroamericanos Chuck Berry. Luego Elvis Presley que lo dio a conocer al mundo. De ahí se va para México y es un ritmo que se sale de Estados Unidos para el mundo entero desde México a Argentina, hay rockeros en Japón, en Alemania en Rusia donde quiera hay. Es un ritmo que vino para la humanidad. Ahora yo creo que la diferencia entre el rock de  Norteamérica  y el de México pues es obvia mente la sociedad. El rock siempre ha sido un grito de libertad de rebeldía. Siempre nos ha hablado de cambiar de rebelarnos ante las normas establecidas entonces de alguna manera el rock es un opositor al sistema. Entonces igual en México funciona, que quiere decir, a través de este ritmo de esta música, hablamos de las cosas que nos afectan. Y de alguna manera a veces es denuncia a veces es protesta a veces simplemente son vivencias de amor lo que sea pero tiene esa particularidad. Que cada pueblo lo adopta y lo transmite desde su punto de vida, de cómo se vive en cada sociedad. Y México tiene una forma muy particular de decir las cosas. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"6000\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ffd90148c6675c9a94eaad8e5cf27454/tumblr_inline_p5785faVVC1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"6000\" data-orig-height=\"4000\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhoto Credit: Ivan Salinas (@nepant_la)\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eIrlanda:\u003c/b\u003e ¿Usted piensa que el rock como género quizá ha perdido popularidad en México? A través de lo años? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHaragán: \u003c/b\u003eYo creo que no hay un público muy específico que sigue el rock al ritmo del rock mexicano. Este púbico generalmente se dice que el rockero es más inteligente. Se han hecho  estudios que el rock y rolero por lo mismo que tiene rebeldía, y que te incita el cambio. Y lo adopta la gente más inteligente e hay un público muy grande el hecho es que hay festivales gigantescos en México. Vamos a tocar en el vive latino por ejemplo donde van 50,000 personal 100,000 mil. Quiere decir que hay un público muy grande que escucha rock en español y el Haragán va estar ahí esperamos una gran respuesta. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eIrlanda:\u003c/b\u003e Usted lleva más de veinte años en la industria de la música. ¿Usted cómo siente que ha cambiado rock ó a permanecido igual durante este tiempo?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHaragán:\u003c/b\u003e Tenemos 28 años tocando y obviamente seguía el movimiento desde atrás. Tenía mucho tiempo tocando pero desde que hice Haragán y Compañía tiene 28 años. ¿Y que ha cambiado? Sigues siendo lo mismo  en cuanto él inquietud de la gente. En cuanto las cosas que hablamos, parece que hablamos de lo mismo, como son problemas humanos hablamos de la represión policíaca, de las cosas que han pasado en la calle hay una canción por ejemplo que se llama “El no lo mato” bueno eso sucedió en el 1987, y hoy en día sigue sucediendo. Entonces qué quiere decir que nos repetimos como humanidad tenemos una tendencia de repetirse muchas veces. El rock evoluciona yo lo que veo es que al rock no lo puedes engañar rock es un ritmo puro es un ritmo que no engaña y se renueva cada diez años. Vuelve ser como el mismo ritmo otra vez vuelve a la base y vuelve a ser rebelde otra vez. Nuevamente la industria lo quiere vestir de rosa, hacer de una manera más digerible para las masas, es más pop pero de pronto el rock regresa de nuevo a sus raíces Y surge nuevamente grupos que le dan de vuelta al mundo y al sistema. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eIrlanda: \u003c/b\u003e¿Más auténtico?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHaragán: \u003c/b\u003eSi más auténtico, el rock es una guitarra de pronto ronca un grito de desesperación de libertad. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eIrlanda: \u003c/b\u003eY ahorita mencionó la canción “el no lo mato” ¿Es basada en una historia real?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHaragán:\u003c/b\u003e Definitivamente si. Lo que hago en la canción es nada más narrar lo que sucedió. Se puede decir que es una canción muy fácil de escribir pero es una canción muy difícil de vivir porque le sucedió a un amigo mio. Entonces tuve que vivir eso tuve que ir a sepelio al velorio fue algo muy triste porque tenía 17 años. Y yo nada más lo que hice fue describir lo que pasó. Fue fácil y ha sido una canción muy famosa. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2050\" data-orig-height=\"2523\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dfc13e191bafd5ec4d72822111cbec73/tumblr_inline_p57872KfFa1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2050\" data-orig-height=\"2523\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhoto Credit: Ivan Salinas (@nepant_la)\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eIrlanda:\u003c/b\u003e Y si la verdad. ¿Usted quizá al escribir esta canción y presentársela al mundo quiso tener un impacto público, que hubiera cambios en la sociedad cómo se comportan los policías y hasta los jóvenes?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHaragán:\u003c/b\u003e Mira, cuando yo compongo una canción, no pienso en el éxito. Y en ese tiempo yo no pensaba en nada, yo nada más hacía canciones y no pensaba en el impacto que pudieran tener. Pero definitivamente pienso que la canción si ha concientizado a la policía de México  a la policía de muchos lados sabemos que hay mucha violencia policíaca generalmente quien quiere ser policía, es alguien que es muy violento y este, el gobierno los utiliza para eso, para la represión. Pero yo me encontrado muchos policías en México que luego me cuidan en los eventos y me llevan al camerino yes gente que cuando canto la canción ellos la están cantando también. Entonces como que si despierta conciencia. Creo que sí ha habido cambios como la gente que escucha el mensaje y ese es el impacto más grande que puede haber el impacto mental \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eIrlanda:\u003c/b\u003e ¿Y de todas las canciones que usted ha tenido en su carrera cuál piensa usted que es la que as ha tenido popularidad hasta en el mainstream, como se dice?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHaragán:\u003c/b\u003e Mira ahora hace  poco hicimos una impuesta en a propósito de los 28 años que cumplimos hicimos un evento en Agosto pasado y por Internet una encuesta por face [Facebook] cuál canción era la que más querían a mí me sorprendió porque surgió que hay una canción que le ganó a todas. Se llama purgante de amor. Esa le ganó a todas seguida por gran velocidad, y el no lo mato estaba como en el puesto número seis por ahí. No te explicas porque les gustas, no sabes. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eIrlanda:\u003c/b\u003e Y fíjese que es algo que estaba pensando, la música que suele pegar al mainstream que la gente toca mucho, son generalidades como el amor, y hasta eso es algo un poco oscuro. Si estas enamorado pero de quién, porque nunca en realidad dicen algo contundente algo específico, o único.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHaragán:\u003c/b\u003e ¡Exacto! Por ejemplo “Purgante de amor” no habla de un amor color de rosas o nada así. Habla de que estoy perdido enamorado y no lo puedo entender, “no lo puedo evitar quiero y no puedo dejarte de amar y al final hay una frase que dice cuando te sientas asi igual que yo ve a la farmacia de la esquina y tomate un purgante de amor. Un brebaje mágico que te cure de amor.” Eso les gusta. Les gusta pero es una forma de hablar del amor, no metafórico es más directo. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eIrlanda:\u003c/b\u003e Claro que si. ¿Cual es un tema que cuando usted empieza a cantar, el público le pide. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHaragán:\u003c/b\u003e Hay una canción que siempre la piden es me sorprende  también está en el número 12 de las más preferidas. Se llama, “En los años treinta” habla de mi papa se la compuse a mi papá que nació en los años treintas y entonces mi papá ya murió. Pero se identifican con eso yo pienso que tiene un sentido muy paternal la canción se acuerdan de su abuelito no sé. Es una canción como para niños.  Yo creo que les tocó el niño interno y la quieren escuchar. Es sorprendente. No se puede uno explicar como. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eIrlanda:\u003c/b\u003e ¿Y cual es su meta artística? Que la gente venga a su concierto y se salgan sintiendo alegres o sintiéndose radicales tratado de cambiar el mundo o de ser mejor. ¿Cual es su meta como artista? Qué mensaje quiere dar?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHaragán:\u003c/b\u003e Precisamente hace rato estaba pensando eso. ¿Por que hago esto? Es como cosechar lo que sembré hace muchos años. Afortunadamente tenemos trabajo nos quieren ver aquí en Los Ángeles nos quieren ver en Nueva York. Nos quieren ver en Oregon y estamos de gira siempre. De hecho nos vamos de aquí, de Estado Unidos el domingo y el lunes tocamos en Hidalgo en México y el martes volamos a Chicago. Entonces es un itinerario a veces cansado. Pero cuando te preguntas, pues “¿porque quiero estar aquí? Y ¿La gente porque te quiere ver? De alguna manera les entregas algo. Y este ellos con mucho gusto se preparan desde temprano para verte hay algo que tú les das que ellos quieren ver. No sé desahogarse, gritar, bailar, a veces hasta emborracharse, si tu quieres llorar, cantar porque así es. Estamos hablando de la transmisión mutua de sentimientos entonces ahí es donde entra la magia de todo esto y yo digo bueno pues voy a seguir en esto siempre. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eIrlanda:\u003c/b\u003e La verdad que bueno, estábamos escuchando sus temas en el camino aquí, y “Mi muñequita sintetica” en Youtube tiene 26 millones de views. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHaragán: \u003c/b\u003e26 millones, no hombre ya quiero mis regalías. Jaja. Acabo de hacer un trato con, bebo, me va a pagar las regalías ya jaja.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eIrlanda:\u003c/b\u003e ¿Usted como compositor que lo inspira? Hablamos un poquito sobre la sociedad, a lo mejor usted va y medita o va a cierta localidad para inspirarse? O medita antes de escribir, o no más le llega repentinamente una canción?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHaragán:\u003c/b\u003e Yo tuve una época muy prolífica de composición entre los diez años y los veinte luego sigue una segunda de los veinte a los treinta y así. Le he disminuido a la composición un poquito pero lo que me nutria en ese tiempo es que caminaba yo salía a caminar, caminaba en la calle iba en el metro,  en el autobús donde fuera veía y observaba los cuadros citadinos lo que la gente  veía. Veías a la gente triste en el metro y surgía una canción. Veía la muñequita sintética que estaba ahí en mi colonia en el pueblo donde yo vivo, y de pronto surge “La munequita sintetica” y es eso. Es observación. Mi mejor terapia para componer es caminar nada más. Donde sea hasta en el cerro. jaja. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eIrlanda:\u003c/b\u003e Bueno muchísimas gracias por la entrevista fue un placer. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHaragán:\u003c/b\u003e Gracias a ustedes, muy buenas— muy inteligentes tus preguntas. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"743\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6f2a67ac9f28facf96a57d4b8e209f3e/tumblr_inline_p5788rv1UG1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"750\" data-orig-height=\"743\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eLuis Alvarez with Irlanda Mora. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eListen to the full interview \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-133289859/entrevista-con-luis-alvarez-el-haragan\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e!\u003c/p\u003e",

Meanwhile, the Remy Boyz rhythmically hop around, and every now and then one of the Boyz throws out a “1738!” or “RGF Productions, RGF!” to supplement Fetty’s rapping. Watching this group of men dance around in their black joggers and slim gold chains, I wave aside the clouds of vape smoke from my face and dance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the musty, poorly lit theater, Fetty Wap swerves and jumps around, all the while unleashing his warbling vibrato and candid lyrics (“She fine as hell and she know that shit/Baby, welcome to the money”). For someone who shows complete disregard for enunciation or vocal control, Fetty Wap demonstrates a surprising mastery over melody. His voice conveys sweet poignancy even on his more aggressive “slay the rap game” songs, and on his softer track “Again,” he sounds almost mournful. Meanwhile, Monty (one of the aforementioned Remy Boyz) rapidly sways back and forth and raps enthusiastically about his YSL denim and how no one can take his bitches.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eObviously, the highlight of the night was “Trap Queen.” I know, I know, I’m basic and lack the sophisticated understanding of Fetty Wap’s discography required to savor his lesser known music. But in my defense, Fetty himself seemed to light up during this song’s performance, flashing a smile and gracefully tossing his hair to the beat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eContrary to my expectations, the show does not end with the energetic “Trap Queen.” Instead, Fetty Wap finishes his concert on a gentler note, as if gradually lowering his audience back to reality. He transitions into a series of a capella raps, dedicating one verse “for the ladies,” another “for his fellas,” and finally concludes with a song “for his day ones.” He “th-th-th-thanks us all so-so-soOo much for coming out tonight,” then breaks into “679,” flanked by his bouncing Remy Boyz. As “679” fades out (Fetty Wap stops singing about two-thirds of the way into the song, allowing a recording to take over for him), more people in joggers rush out from backstage and thrash around on stage with Fetty. The drum-heavy hook pulsates throughout the Belasco, and Fetty Wap grins at the enthralled audience one last time before disappearing from sight, ending the night with mystery and flair.\u003c/p\u003e",

Her music is hard to categorize, but is certainly dark and minimal with heavy dubstep influences. 2017 marked a milestone for REZZ with the release of her widely successful debut album \u003ci\u003eMass Manipulation \u003c/i\u003eon deadmau5’s label, mau5trap. There’s not many artists out there right now that can be compared to REZZ, and therefore it’s no surprise she’s gained a massive and exponentially growing, cult-like following known as Rezz-bians. This year, she will be performing at Coachella, Electric Forest, and likely many other big name festivals as she cements herself as a staple electronic act for festival lineups. Make sure to stop by and check her out.

With the release of her two impressive EPs, she has set the tone for her career, earning her the respect and praise from many well respected publications. Even though she is releasing music pretty damn quickly, nothing about her music seems rushed or unintentional. Her silky voice floats in and out of the melodic bass lines, often times switching between English and Korean. The production of her music is seamless and fluid, creating the perfect balance of dance music and darkness for the listener.

Unapologetically confident and original, Whipped Cream is currently making a name for herself as she headbangs into 2018. Her style is forward thinking and unique, with hard hitting drops and stimulating samples. Any trap fan will fall in love with Whipped Cream. Keep an eye out for this LA-based artist, as she will surely be appearing at some more Brownies and Lemonade type events in the new year.\u003c/p\u003e",

At the end of the night, Panache, with the help of the artists who volunteered their time, the Teragram Ballroom, Planned Parenthood representatives, and all of the people who came out, raised over $18k for the nonprofit.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The night was stacked with memorable performances. Cones opened the night with a short, heartwarming set. Meatbodies’ Chad Ubovich was the first of many to cover classic songs. Ubovich’s rendition of The Brian Jonestown Massacre’s “Miss June 75″ was uncharacteristically gentle. He was followed Drugdealer, who, in the absence of their lead singer, spent the day learning new songs, feeling wrong performing their original material without her. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c859fc6f6fa74738ea37c5954ee1e312/tumblr_inline_p4mmvgNIru1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eLay then took the stage, opening with an a cappella cover of The Zombie’s “The Way I Feel Inside,” during which the crowd fell silent, their jaws rightfully hanging in awe. Lay continued with a cover of George Harrison’s “If Not For You,” which she dedicated to those in the audience who were in love, followed by J. Giels Band’s “Love Stinks,” which many in the audience joined her for. William Tyler followed, sheepishly introducing his set of failed love songs, shocking the audience with the quickness in which he plucked his guitar strings. King Tuff then played a couple of covers before an original “about loving people, no matter how fucking butt ugly they are.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c6ad411540a3860c04f792c418153497/tumblr_inline_p4mmwrMeyE1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0c0823768014c468945a63c4c39f037d/tumblr_inline_p4mmwz07y81qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eCronin gave a heartwarming performance of covers, one of which was a Neil Young song that he had learned to play the harmonica for.

Rodrigo Amarante came on next accompanied by two female back up singers, giving a performance reminiscent of 60s gospel rock. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0cb97e79344c81369f38ad6f360ff0d5/tumblr_inline_p4mmxfDV8K1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eSegall, who was more than a few beers into the night, surprised the crowd with a fairly long set of drunken karaoke, most of which was dedicated to his wife, who watched with what seemed to be both pride and shame from the side of the stage. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Segall’s garishly humorous performance was followed by Best Coast. A few young girls shrieked with glee as Bethany Cosentino took the stage. The band opened with covers of songs by The Jesus and Mary Chain and then a rendition of Sheryl Crow’s “If it Makes You Happy,” which Cosentino dedicated to a man who once referred to her as the “indie Sheryl Crow.” Waterhouse, a universal crowd pleaser, closed the night with songs characteristic of his bluesy style. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ac5085b34a23334856449d967114f917/tumblr_inline_p4mmxm0a681qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

Festivals, they offer a little bit of something different because you have to more work for it unless you\u0026rsquo;re huge and everyone\u0026rsquo;s there for you; but for us, it\u0026rsquo;s not the case so we have to work for people\u0026rsquo;s \u0026hellip; the crowd or whatever.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eFletcher: \u003c/b\u003eAgreed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSoft Cell: \u003c/b\u003eSpeaking of which, your guys\u0026rsquo; outputs seem to be on full blast, song after song, show after show, music video after music video, but there doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be a lot of stuff that is coming out that is very personal. As corny as it sounds, I feel like people don\u0026rsquo;t really know who Fletcher and Wyatt are. Are you guys doing this on a conscious or unconscious level? And whatever it is, do you guys like it this way or do you want people to know more?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eFletcher: \u003c/b\u003eI think the next album is really personal, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know how hidden that is to some people. I think we put a lot of our personal lives into the next album. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if that\u0026rsquo;s going to be obvious or not. We also do the side projects Puzzle and Enjoy, and those are pretty much \u0026hellip; I know when I speak for myself, Puzzle is all about my daily life, and it\u0026rsquo;s literally all about just \u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s all pretty personal for the most part, but I don\u0026rsquo;t know how much comes off like that or not, but to me all the songs are pretty personal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWyatt: \u003c/b\u003eTypically, with The Garden as well, we never really have operated on a lyrical level of being like \u0026ldquo;I love you baby and I\u0026rsquo;m blah blah,\u0026rdquo; you know to the next step. We\u0026rsquo;re more \u0026hellip; I don\u0026rsquo;t know, I guess we just say it in a different way. I thought it was obvious, but I guess it\u0026rsquo;s not (laughs). With the lyrics the next album is definitely a lot more personal, and the EP we just put out kind of was too. Can\u0026rsquo;t say that as much for Haha though, but some parts of it I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSoft Cell:\u003c/b\u003e Is there are misconceptions you think people have about your guys.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eFletcher:\u003c/b\u003e Probably a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWyatt: \u003c/b\u003eYeah, there\u0026rsquo;s probably a lot more than we even realize honestly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eFletcher:\u003c/b\u003e It\u0026rsquo;s hard to say.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWyatt:\u003c/b\u003e They are always out there. That we were doing modeling before music and then that\u0026rsquo;s how we got into music, and modeling lifted our music and what not, which is untrue, but it\u0026rsquo;s just one of those things that\u0026rsquo;s not even worth arguing about because at the end of the day people are just going to want to believe what they want to believe so, you can only say so much. So that kind of died off for us years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eFletcher:\u003c/b\u003e I think we most of the time choose to say nothing because at the end of the day people are always gonna have their opinions on what you\u0026rsquo;re doing, so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter at the end of the day. We just like to do what we\u0026rsquo;re doing, that\u0026rsquo;s what makes us happy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSoft Cell:\u003c/b\u003e That\u0026rsquo;s part of the point to, to let the people interpret everything that you produce.

Armisen’s drum playing is almost as good as his expert impressions.  He combines these talents to give the audience both musical and physical impressions of drummers, from Ringo Starr, to a jazz drummer, to “that friend who thinks they can play the drums,” in a highly entertaining and expressive way. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe show is extraordinarily diverse in its content.  Armisen includes an entire bit where he is playing drums from different eras, including just a hint of humor, and another where he is simply going across a map of North America performing accents from different regions, which is overtly comedic. The special’s lack of clarity and focus (other than drumming) contribute to its randomness, which many find funny. He takes a fresh and unexpected take on comedy by performing for a specific audience, but including more universal, objective, and even unrelated humor simultaneously, and it all somehow works. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis standup special is for musicians, particularly drummers, looking for relatable content, but the show could be funny to any audience.  A lot of the hour is filled with general jokes.  For example, he addresses doctors from the 1700s, a childhood letter, Burger King, and much more, performed in a purely playful way. But as Armisen performs, he might lose some people. His jokes aren’t all fully developed and strong, but they all have a recognizable root value that still makes them funny.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is impressive and rare when a comedy special includes absolutely no profanity. This special is for all ages and hardly contains a questionable word or joke. This choice demonstrates Armisen’s cleverness and raw skill when it comes to comedy.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis impressions and celebrity guests, along with his drum playing in the audience, make this show interactive and transport Netflix viewers to the theater.  His talent, paired with his enthusiasm, makes the whole show feel like it was a childhood dream of his come to life, and his excitement is contagious. You can feel his passion and energy, even when the crowd might not. The whole stand-up special is brought to life by Armisen’s performance, and the experience of watching is hard to forget. \u003c/p\u003e",

Are we to dream continuously over the recent Grammy nominated SZA album? After all, when I heard SiR was meant to deliver a record in early 2018, I had simultaneous goosebumps mulling over the \u003ci\u003eCtrl\u003c/i\u003e record and nightmares regretting the aimless Lance Skiiiwalker record.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYet as the record opens, with a dimly lit chit chat between SiR and what seems to be a flight attendant, or futuristic space dash, one can’t help but imagine the TDE crooner might have something ambitious prepared for the masses. It is a soft spoken exchange about moving forward, confirming that the “engines are ready at 100,” and it arguably sets a scene for a forward thinking album.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe true opener, “That’s Alright,” presents a dreary, psychedelic and colorfully bleak picture of a hopeful girl and her eager love, as SiR sets her aside over and over and satisfies her over and over. It is a groovy piece for the bedroom, as clacking percussion and junky, seducing bass notes bubble under the soft spoken vocals. One has to admit that for an opening statement, the vocals play a more disinterested role as the song proceeds. The second chorus does not hit as hard as the first, and gives up entirely as the track reaches its short lived end. As it echoes away, one can understand that just like the love for this girl, the vocals are ready to disappear at a moment’s notice. It leaves a dry taste in one’s mouth. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DqZwEZOuSEI8\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qZwEZOuSEI8?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs “Something Foreign” continues, one can’t help but anticipate the ScHoolboy Q feature, as SiR enters the picture and leaves with the same sense of disinterest, or perhaps shallow moodiness that only comes off as unexciting. ScHoolboy Q’s demeanor is along the same lines, and he comes and goes with the same jazzy piano notes skipping across the boom bap beat. It is another perfect ballad for the bedroom, but perhaps too short to possibly be enjoyed to the fullest degree in that setting. It is now two instances of a track not being fleshed out enough to be poignant or impressive, despite being smooth as silk. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“D’Evils” is an ode to marijuana, and it comes and goes just as an inhale and exhale of the drug does. Yet the hauntingly high pitched sample keeps the song fresh and addictive between takes of SiR’s, once again, backseat vocals. “A one spliff a day’ll keep the evil away,” is as sticky a refrain as actual top shelf nugs are. “Something New” features British artist Etta Bond, as the two exchange sincere, yet short lived, loving phrases. As the vocals intertwine in the second half of the piece, it is once again evident that the record can have such an imposing presence in a bedroom, yet can be saltless and bland aside from that setting. Etta Bond and SiR have a low amount of chemistry, yet the reverb on the vocals and subtle panning makes the duet a sweet and endearing one. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA second interlude follows the end of this track, as it is revealed that SiR is currently on a spacecraft of some kind, headed to a destination that is “three trillion kilometers away,” yet one can’t help but feel that this entire time the ship has been either stagnant or moving at a sluggish pace. It is an interesting interlude to include in a record where the sentiments and beats are more rooted in the past than they are in some kind of futuristic environment. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe track “I Know” is arguably the worst on the record; A song that is so out of place, so aimless, so grating and discomforting that one has to wonder who was the “yes man” that gave this piece a thumbs up. From the uninteresting and uninspired beat to the plain, drone chords hanging in the background, nothing takes the title of worst channel on the track as the ugly, attuned vocals. This is a track that fails in terms of being interesting, being enjoyable and, worst of all, being sexy. It completely derails the record’s small momentum and sexy aura in the first few seconds when the vocals are introduced. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Never Home” makes a small attempt at trying to recapture the sexy wave that the record was flowing on in the first half of the record. The tiny, angelic harmonies behind the “I’m never home” refrain are honestly ruined by the harsh phone call that rambles on and on in the forefront. Between these two previous tracks, the record needed some desperate help.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“War” is a slight return to form, as SiR regrets and simps over a failed relationship displayed in the previous track. “I’m ready to fall for ya…I’m ready to fight for us,” are modest remarks crooned and whimpered graciously that are ready to make and can spice up the bedroom once again. However, the “da da da da da” vocals riddling the last third of the track are, once again, a questionable decision on behalf of the TDE singer. They take away from the lo fi aesthetic and are, to put it bluntly, flat out ugly. “Better” is a hollow trap-influenced R\u0026amp;B song that contains certain pauses where one can only assume a guest rapper was to have found an entrance. The vocals that SiR provides here are a bit monotonous and robotic, but can still work in the bedroom if played at a lower volume that the first half of the record. The interlude at the end of this song also presents the same setting where SiR converses with his “mothership,” and a much more intriguing and colorful instrumental, only referred to as “ultralight,” is played. Now would be a better time than any to mention that the voice of the “mothership” has changed across the three interludes. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSiR then proclaims going into “autopilot” and the final two tracks do just that. “Dreaming of Me” is a sensual piece that depends a lot on glitchy, alternating pitch vocals that pop in and out of the mix along with the lo fi beat and wahwah guitar licks. The closer, “Summer in November,” is an endearing love song directed at a woman that changes the ambiance of SiR’s environment. As he presents his most energetic and dominant vocals on the chorus, one can only wish that the middle portion of the record had continued with the same energy and ambiance. The interludes were misleading, but it is safe to say that there is a healthy batch of great bedroom tracks on the record and that it satisfies as a prequel to what SiR can potentially deliver in the near future. It is not a grand presentation, as \u003ci\u003eCtrl\u003c/i\u003e was, but it is definitely another modest delivery from the TDE camp.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e6/10…\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\n\u003cb\u003e#somereallygreatbedroomsongs/10\u003c/b\u003e\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

He, alongside Aventura, helped commercialize and make bachata mainstream in the early 90s. With over twenty years in the music industry he has rightfully earned the title of “king of bachata.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eGolden\u003c/i\u003e is an interesting album. As a whole it is okay, but I had higher standards for Santos. The album begins with an electronic synthetic beat combined with lyrics in English. This serves to welcome new listeners that have been recently introduced to the Latinx music market via the now deplorable “Despacito.” This introduction commemorates his experience in the music industry. He singsongs phrases that are commonly mistaken as arrogant such as, “every hundred years an artist like me is born,” yet the delivery simply suggests that listeners appreciate his music now that he’s alive. A common trope in Latin America is uplifting artists after death.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen there’s “Tuyo.” This song has traditional bachata guitar strumming coupled with assuring romantic lyrics of loyalty, and devotion sung in falsetto. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Perjurio” has an alluring beat, one where the listener must nod along and cannot resist dancing. However, this uplifting vibrant beat is juxtaposed with cynical lyrics of moving on from a fling, one devoid of emotional attachment and rampant with disloyalty. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Premio” features Swizz Beatz has the most synthetic sound from the whole album. At 54 seconds the beat completely changes and the guitar stops, there is an intermission that captivates and soothes the listener.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Carmín,” \n\na ballad sung in falsetto, begins with a piano run. Juan Luis Guerra makes his presence known and he harmonizes with Santos seamlessly. Overall it’s extremely soothing. This is a song for anyone that’s caught up in their feelings! The outro of the song is the highlight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Centavito” has a very 90s vibe, it reminded me of “Obsesión” Santos. It covers topics such as masculinity. At 3:06 the guitar riff is phenomenal. This song is one of the top ones in the album - thelyrics are very clingy though. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Sobredosis,” featuring Ozuna, is a sensual song. Ozuna singing in bachata wasn’t something I thought I needed, but he’s pleasing to listen to. His voice is softer than usual and he steals the show away. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen there are “El Papel 1: versión amante” and “El papel 2” The first is a song from the side piece point of view. It’s a nice contrast of a relaxing beat and the vivid imagery of a person trapped in a toxic relationship. “El papel 2″ is extremely vulnerable and the instrumentation reflects this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Bella y Sensual,” featuring Daddy Yankee and Nicky Jam, has an engaging and festive beat. If any song off of\u003ci\u003e Golden\u003c/i\u003e will get a tremendous amount of radio play, it’s this one. It differs from all other songs in the album because is has a very pop beat. In terms of verses, Nicky Jam topped this one. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Doble Filo” has the most bachata sound. It sounds as if it was recorded right out of a barrio in the Dominican Republic. This song is traditional bachata, it has hurt lyrics coupled with rhythmic guitar. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Ay Bendito” talks about heartbreak. “Heroe favorito” is the most romantic song on the album. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“El amigo,” featuring Julio Iglesias, is comedic because they essentially wrote a song about their penises. *sigh* someone needs to give straight men a lecture on comedy, but I digress. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Reina de papi” reminds his listeners to avoid settling for just anyone. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Imitadora” is a BOP. Easily the most commercialized sound, it also carries a common theme of falling out of love with someone. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Un Vuelo,” featuring Jesse Reyes, is a song of two exes bantering back and forth, and thankfulness over their break-up is juxtaposed with a slow, romantic beat. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eGolden\u003c/i\u003e ends with “Sin Filtro,” in which Santos proclaims that he has proven himself as an artist.  Overall, the album is an interesting roller coaster ride, where you’re perpetually heartbroken, attempting to woo someone, and laughing at the shenanigans of some of these lyrics. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/6bm9EpUNvQ9xMglBJGRmgS\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e",

However, what many people failed to recognize is that Will Smith’s son has a name, and he goes by the name of Jaden Christopher Syre Smith. A teenager who has had to live in the shadow of his parents for his entire life alongside his sister Willow, Smith has seen scrutiny time and time again from the public for his artistic decisions as well as the public persona he portrays. However, what was often neglected was the content and the work he was putting in to create his own legacy. Now, at 19, Smith is one of the figureheads of his own clothing company/collective/music label called MSFTSREP, is a co-founder of boxed water company JUST water, and has had a hand in a multitude of other mediums, including a collaboration with Umami Burger on a vegan burger. However, more than ever, it feels as though Smith’s music was bound to get more attention after he had posted an assortment of snippets onto his Instagram (\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/c.syresmith/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@c.syresmith\u003c/a\u003e). These snippets had generated a huge assortment of excitement, particularly the snippet entitled “ICON.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo with seemingly all eyes on him, Smith released his debut album entitled \u003ci\u003eSYRE\u003c/i\u003e, which he says was three years in the making.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eComing into this record, I had high hopes considering that I have been a huge fan of Smith’s for around three to four years. After hearing his previous projects such as \u003ci\u003eCool Tape Vol. 2\u003c/i\u003e (\u003ci\u003eCTV2\u003c/i\u003e) and his \u003ci\u003eThis Is The Album\u003c/i\u003e EP, what I had gotten from Smith up to that point was that he was a thinker who merely wished to translate his thoughts into mediums of expression. That was what justified his early tweets, as well as opened up a new perspective about the person Smith was becoming right before my very eyes. And the opening track of his album, the four track opener “BLUE” (stylized “B,” “L,” “U,” and “E”), showcases such incredible growth that is apparent through the musicality, experimental vocal cadences and pitches, and precise focus that was displayed on verses that he uttered throughout the four tracks. It was a phenomenal opener, and one that was bound to catch the attention of Jaden Smith naysayers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dcmc8q2dcIMs\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cmc8q2dcIMs?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eEssentially, the first half of the record plays along the lines of these four songs, seamlessly flowing from one track to the next and articulating the story of the character Smith has opted to create that is based around one of his middle names: “Syre.” As a listener, the more I delved deeper and deeper into the record, the more nuances I was able to pick up on, and the more I came to appreciate the attention to detail that Smith provided for this project. The track durations ranged from a couple of minutes to nine and a half minutes at most, and each song utilized Smith to the fullest extent. On the first half, the record plays like a film that Smith aspires to make, and the second half, though not as concise as the first, showcases a broad range of Smith’s skill set as well as his influences. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHints of Childish Gambino, Kid Cudi, and Kanye West reign supreme on certain tracks; however, what I find particularly interesting about Smith’s music is he does not shy away from his influences. Rather, he is very blatant in showcasing his interpretations of his idols, even stating on the track “Icon” that he “owes it all to Cudi and to Tycho.” On a track like “Watch Me,” it is very easy to see the resemblance to Kanye West’s “Black Skinhead” off of his \u003ci\u003eYeezus\u003c/i\u003e LP. It is also intriguing to see the resemblance to Kid Cudi’s song “Surfin,’” off of his recent LP \u003ci\u003ePassion, Pain, and Demon Slayin’\u003c/i\u003e. Other tracks such as “George Jeff” showcase even more similarities to artists like Childish Gambino, and how he utilized his skill set on a track such as “I.The Party.” Smith incorporates such various styles that it creates an enjoyable listen, with very heartbreaking overtones and occasionally braggodocios undertones.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis album is not perfect, and not without its flaws, particularly when reflecting on run time and transitions within songs that are at times underwhelming in my mind. However, what \u003ci\u003eSYRE\u003c/i\u003e presents is a nineteen year old who is attempting to do something that strays away from conventional formulas, and inspires a new generation to do the same. Considering the people that are around Smith’s age that are getting popularity, particularly the Lil Pumps, Lil Yachtys, and Desiigners of the world, Smith elects to not solely follow trends. Rather, what he offers is his own interpretation of these styles in an attempt to create sounds and music that drastically differ from the pool of new music we receive day in and day out. And on that front, \u003ci\u003eSYRE\u003c/i\u003e is a successful record and one that has immense potential in kickstarting the career of Jaden Smith as more than just the son of Will Smith.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e8/10\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

The festival had booked a dynamic lineup ranging from the reflective harp music of Mary Lattimore to the infectiously energetic jams of King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard. This lineup was historically equal, with roughly 30% of its acts featuring female artists, including the four sisters of Stonefield. Even outside the realm of the male-saturated genres psychedelia and rock, few festival lineups can boast such a high ratio of female to male talent. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe intimate festival was dealt a tough hand this year. Difficulties with optimizing car flow at the new venue made for a slow entrance Friday afternoon, and lightning and heavy rain cut the first night of the weekend short. Event staff were forced to send festival-goers back to shelter and safety after the evening’s headliner, Australian psych-rock giant Tame Impala, had only played 3 songs. Many of the crowd were campers, who returned to their sites to move the nighttime festivities inside their tents while they waited out the worst of the storm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5472\" data-orig-height=\"3648\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/69b6d7a1c3d4d661e3d86c07335d0966/tumblr_inline_ph60wx33ns1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5472\" data-orig-height=\"3648\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eTame Impala\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe next morning began with an energy of cautious optimism. While I washed up in a restroom, a showering camper hummed along to an old-time favorite that was an accurate forecast of the weekend to come \u0026ndash; Death Cab For Cutie’s “I Will Possess Your Heart”. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI walked back to the campsite to put on the warmest clothes I’d packed in an effort to blend in with the rest of the crowd. Everyone had made a marked change in attire with the 20F temperature swing, exchanging free-flowing outfits for flannels and boots overnight, like a pop-up village of lumberjacks in Southern California. Cloudy skies and 60’s highs greeted us as we entered the festival that day, so I grabbed a hot chocolate yerba before settling in at the main stage for Kevin Morby. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter about two minutes of the tension-building intro of “City Music”, Morby faced away from the crowd just before his first vocal delivery of the set. The clouds behind us parted to cast a warm light on the stage, and the crowd turned in disbelief at our first sighting of the sun. We erupted in cheers that stirred Morby to face the crowd just as the song hit its stride.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5140\" data-orig-height=\"3427\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a3d121228f082c830976976c751b0c48/tumblr_inline_ph60y7aIyv1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5140\" data-orig-height=\"3427\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eKevin Morby performing\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKevin Morby’s sunlit set the tone for the remainder of a magical weekend — here’s a quick rundown of the rest:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Block stage, located in front of a grassy area near the food vendors, was the perfect place for an afternoon recharge. Boutiques with handmade clothing, iron-on jacket patches, and artwork formed a row to the side of the stage for browsing. Colorful overhead visuals were aimed at several white cloth triangles rippling against the sky. These framed the scene for artists including Jazz-freak Gladys Lazer and Kikagaku Moyo, a Tokyo psych band whose name translates to “geometric patterns.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5472\" data-orig-height=\"3648\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/890b52d1daff4002ae6951683a58b02e/tumblr_inline_ph60yuIY6Z1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5472\" data-orig-height=\"3648\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eKikagaku Moyo\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Moon stage was closer to the shore. As temperatures rose, one could spot a raft-size pegasus floatie cruising the perimeter and the occasional festival goer listening to the vibrations of sound from underwater. This lake was unswimmable and the shore sandless until very recently. The combined efforts of California’s park rangers and Desert Daze coordinators rehabilitated Moreno Beach Park into the recreational paradise that it now is. This shoreline provided the perfect setting for the sand riot that was Death Grips’s performance and Slowdive’s moody 90’s shoegaze. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f544cccfcb09c1fac3080e93876e4b2a/tumblr_inline_ph60zzWDb61qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eSlowdive at Desert Daze\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe tented Theatre stage stood on the other end of the renovated shore, just past a sea of art installations. Its womb-like entrance was flanked by towers of analog TV sets leading into an intimate standing area. This tent hosted krautrock legacy Malcolm Mooney and audience-participating Q\u0026amp;As with musicians Gerald Casale of DEVO and Steve Albini, producer of Nirvana’s In Utero.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdditional alternative programming could be found at Desert Daze’s famed Mystic Bazaar, which features a rotation of yoga, tea ceremonies and guided meditative journeys that are sure to please the spiritually inclined. A popular morning soundbath was consistently included in this lineup, but late-risers need not worry - a newer 5th stage, the Sanctuary, hosted sound compositions all day long shielded under a dome. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe ground of this steamy tent was littered with resting bodies experiencing what can most accurately be described as a deep-tissue brain massage delivered via sound. Outside this sanctuary, vibrant portals, interactive light tunnels, and the furnishings of an entirely white living room sprinkled the park grounds between stages for the enjoyment of dazed-out wanderers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDesert Daze captivated the hearts of those who roughed the storm. The festival’s team put worthwhile effort into renovating what is now a breathtaking music venue and natural playground. They overcame the logistical learning curve associated with a change in venue and did their best in a difficult circumstance that was beyond their control. Assuming that the untamable courses of nature won’t bring hail next year, the masterminds of this event are sure to win us over tenfold at Moreno Beach in 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5472\" data-orig-height=\"3648\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/661ed91a9d31fbf7b458d914c52653e3/tumblr_inline_ph6129In331qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5472\" data-orig-height=\"3648\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

With that being said, when I was asked to cover 88Rising’s Head in the Clouds Music and Arts Festival, I was quick to respond with a heightened sense of excitement, “YES!” 88Rising’s Head in the Clouds Music and Arts Festival filled Los Angeles Historic State Park last Saturday, September 22nd, with an atmosphere almost difficult to describe. I could say that it matched the energy of any other music festival but, then again, it didn’t. The level of excitement I was fortunate enough to witness and be a part of was something not only beautiful but, historical as well. The lineup featured Rich Brian, Joji, Keith Ape, Zion. T, Higher Brothers, NIKI, Sen Morimoto, and KOHH, making it the largest festival lineup of Asian artists in North American history. In addition, the festival was a nice salute to the 88Rising’s crew album, “Head in the Clouds,” just released earlier in 2018. The festival was a celebration of all 88Rising has accomplished within the past five years. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"6000\" data-orig-width=\"4000\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bb498fc691268d15c3ae0204e6c83ce8/tumblr_inline_pfzfon6KWf1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"6000\" data-orig-width=\"4000\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eI had the privilege to spark conversation with some of those who had waited in line to see their favorite artists since early in the morning, those who felt deeply connected to them. When I asked one young girl pressed up against the barricade, happy as ever, clinging closely to her large Japanese flag, why this festival held importance to her, she responded, “I never grew up with artists like Joji being so popular in mainstream culture. It makes me proud to be Japanese and to feel like my voice is heard.” She was right. Throughout the festival I continuously found myself in awe at how the music of Higher Brothers and Zion.T, both of which sung in their native Chinese and Korean, transcended language barriers. People were simply there to enjoy the music, enjoy the atmosphere, and enjoy the company. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/389da51bbf6a2530f330798454e0588b/tumblr_inline_pfzfp2JUKW1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9c439c2903404f702a3bf388db3e0d26/tumblr_inline_pfzfpkygpD1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition, the festival grounds itself offered a wide variety of food and drink for its attendees to choose from. With three different beer gardens, free water booths, and a night market featuring Howling Rays, Chris Oh, Seoul Street, and Baohouse, guests had no problem entertaining themselves with more than just the music. The VIP area also offered a great way to attend the concert in an intimate way. With white lounge couches, a private beer garden, and a small pit close to the main stage, those in VIP had the option to enjoy the festival in a more intimate, private way. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c60741bfda2b0e71eb14a049055dfc11/tumblr_inline_pfzfr5oy641qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, the main attraction for the day-long festival was, of course, the music. With artists having 20 to 30 minute set with short 2 to 3 minute breaks in-between sets, the entertainment was near constant and the energy levels remained high the entire afternoon blending into the night. One group, in particular, that created a good vibe leading into the evening was Higher Brothers (海尔兄弟). This Chinese hip-hop group consisting of members MaSiWei (马思唯), DZknow (丁震), Psy.P (杨俊逸), and Melo (谢宇杰) re-established the hype going into the evening, preparing the audience for artists like Keith Ape, Murda Beatz, Anderson Paak, and Rich Brian, with their songs like “Made in China” and “WeChat.” Joji was another personal favorite of mine from the evening. With songs like “SLOW DANCING IN THE DARK” and “YEAH RIGHT,” Joji stripped the energy down to one resembling a high school dance in the school cafeteria. You’re dancing with your high school sweetheart, shitty decorations for a theme you can’t quite make out, the smell of lunch served earlier, but you’re just in love and happy to be there. It was an almost romantic atmosphere, making a nice shift from the high energy performances of the evening. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6dd8bb3791be1b6bc07e29cbd0854028/tumblr_inline_pfzfsciWmu1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eGranted, the most exciting part of the evening for everyone, as seen from the photo pit, was definitely when all artists of the day came out to sing their summer hit, “Midsummer Madness,” and other hit songs from their group album “Head in the Clouds,” at the end of the night. It was in this moment, I sensed this large community of people from the audience, different backgrounds, different ethnicities, and different stories all coming together to celebrate the great success of 88Rising and of Asian artists who’ve broken serious glass ceilings in popular culture. Singing and dancing along, creating bonds with complete strangers around me, I couldn’t help but feel so fortunate to have been a part of the crowd, the fans, and the history made that day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/554aedd932b68dd245b18df6bc290cdf/tumblr_inline_pfzfsxj8ta1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

However, this result is not a matter of worth, but rather an inadequacy in their coverage that will inevitably reverse itself as the days go by. It’s only a matter of time that Sons of An Illustrious Father are seen as the worthy entity they truly are, not only for their extravagant music, but the profound and stimulating messages they stand by.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2592\" data-orig-height=\"1728\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0d87e0ae5b030df1a912623eaa864562/tumblr_inline_pc309cHiEk1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-width=\"2592\" data-orig-height=\"1728\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eTheir recent show at The Echo is a testament to the power and beauty they hold, welcome to the world and welcomed by all who cared to absorb. Their live performance is a catharsis, it’s raw, it’s healing, it’s everything in between and nothing short of pure. They mainly performed gut-wrenching songs from their new record\u003ci\u003e Deus Sex Machina: Or, Moving Slowly Beyond Nikola Tesla\u003c/i\u003e. With “U.S. Gay” being an obviously engaging and enraging, in the best way possible, favorite among the eclectic crowd. With Lilah Larson’s sweet harmonious drones and Ezra Miller’s aggressively grinding vocals the song leads as a sort of anthem, when directly compartmentalizing the specificity and bluntness of its cries. It’s a pact between the trio, Sons Of An Illustrious Father and their listeners, their listeners and their friends, their listener’s friends and their local “superiors”, between whoever cares enough and whoever doesn’t care at all. It’s as if you’re being stared into the eyes, through your soul, having every internal cog and mush and wheel caressed lightly, promised personally that “if you wanna fuck shit up, I’ll fuck with you, and if you want to fix it up, we can do that too”.  Often music is nuanced by many different factors, however, in this case, the simplicity is what makes it powerful.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1198\" data-orig-height=\"1728\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f23f93b0f4f2bbdf9392a82d21a67c5b/tumblr_inline_pc309oRVfB1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-width=\"1198\" data-orig-height=\"1728\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt one point they broke out in an a capella version of “All Apologies”, clutching each other gracefully, as if by that they were able to evaporate the pain out of their own bodies. Josh Aubin, in particular, seemed to step out of his performing comfort zone at that moment, joining the two high school friends in a passionate embrace and truly enjoying and embracing every second of it. It was touching and intimate and called for all the energy in the room to level at the same trajectory.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1728\" data-orig-height=\"2592\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d4e07e51722088007de809698be28c00/tumblr_inline_pc30ahEoh51qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-width=\"1728\" data-orig-height=\"2592\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eSons Of An Illustrious Father want to, and urge others to make a complex and beautiful assemblage sculpture out of this pseudo not so pseudo apocalyptic age. Just because we are up to our necks in debris and wreckage and filth doesn’t mean that we are destined to asphyxiate in it. It’s refreshing to listen and experience such a forward motion in music these days. A lot of the time heartache and destruction rein free, with only negative connotations allowed to not only withstand but be promoted. But here, there is a hope, there is a tomorrow where black holes and their infinite density eventually disappear. Music like this feels like the personification of the Coriolis effect, a stronger and more hopeful deflection in wind patterns, igniting itself in each and everyone allowing the power of change.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2592\" data-orig-height=\"1728\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a101f91840bee7d02dcfc46ef2880c95/tumblr_inline_pc30b73j0Z1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-width=\"2592\" data-orig-height=\"1728\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

As I approached the North American Mammal Hall, where the concert was happening, I was stopped by a security guard and told, along with a large group of other youths, to wait on the side.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/35a57e2f7f5ebbed2c629fe02b6b7cf3/tumblr_inline_p9pwa2GfgM1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eFuck\u003c/i\u003e. I thought to myself again. In what I thought was a vain attempt, I lifted my wrist to show him the yellow band, distinct from the pink GA ones. Somehow that neon strip of paper afforded me the privilege of walking straight in without having to queue up. I couldn’t believe it. What I was greeted with was around 250 people all crowded as close as they could get to the barrier as Sagar and company’s dreamy tones started to drift over the audience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo many people were crowded into a dark rectangular space; there was little difference in elevation between the stage and the audience. The result was that very few people could see very much. I tried, futilely, to edge my way in between people to try to get to the front. After half a song’s worth of struggling, a radical idea occurred to me…maybe the wristband could get me even closer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI walked to the edges, where knee-level bars usually keep proper distance between the public and the exhibits, but tonight they separated the maximum-capacity audience from those who were filming the concert and broadcasting it outside the entrance of the hall to those not lucky or dedicated (I heard of some kids waiting in the hall since 6:30 for the group’s 9:15 set) enough to make it inside. The personnel filming gave me wary looks at first, but as soon as they caught sight of the ~magic~ wristband, I was in like Flynn.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3859\" data-orig-height=\"3027\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fea6d7bc1ea1014a4a599abf4e076bfc/tumblr_inline_p9pwaeI2PA1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3859\" data-orig-height=\"3027\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eI strolled right up to the front and was soon stepping around big burly bodyguards to get into a proper position within the photo pit between the clearly temporary stage and audience. I tried my best to fake it and hoped for minimal graininess despite the absence of flash. After the first couple of songs, I saw the “professional” looking lot exiting the pit and circling around the stage, getting different photos from behind the musicians.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis possibility had also not occurred to me, I was amazed as I walk backstage and suddenly found myself rubbing elbows with HOMESHAKE’s inner posse of impeccably dressed friends and female companions. Unbeknownst to me at the time, indie-royalty Mac Demarco and Kiera McNally were casually strolling through the lobby, hugging wide-eyed adolescent fans as I tried my best to give off the air of a proper member of the press. Backstage, and newly emboldened, I continued to snap some photos until the end of the set.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/37125a31d861995f6a94b29e28573311/tumblr_inline_p9pwavRZGB1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eHOMESHAKE’s performances are nothing thrilling. Their music does not have peaks and valleys for the audience to ride, but rather mellow ripples that are meant to flow around you, to be felt, and then to dissipate. Certainly, more sonic than melodic, but not immune to its appeal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Khmlwugh” was the only song where the audience became enthralled enough to sing out in a hushed chorus the irresistibly cheeky and lyrics which form the song’s acronymic title, “kissing, hugging, making love, and waking up and getting high.” Sagar hits a button on his Finland SP-404 and suddenly the falsetto bridge is cooed out from the speakers, and the audience goes crazy for something that isn’t all that impressive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt times Sagar looked tired, or just plain disinterested, but at one point he asked, “Is everyone ok?” checking in on the tightly packed audience before following it up with the bluntly delivered, “Are you enjoying the presence of taxidermy all around you?” to which a few beaming fans cheered back in affirmation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a354c87564363b013bd5768167f3d599/tumblr_inline_p9pwb8rHqK1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eA rare little jig from Peter Sagar\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe band trudged through their set without spending much time interacting with the audience in between songs. The entire time I found it strange yet kind of funny to watch them calmly bob their heads and then suddenly catch a glimpse of a massive bison or walrus perched behind them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the end of the allotted time approached, Sagar rhetorically asked the audience “Do you guys think we could play three songs in ten minutes because I sure don’t,” before resigning to play two more songs. In between the two songs a special guest, who few people in the audience recognized, myself included, hopped onstage and played a couple riffs on a keytar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the night ended without much fanfare at 10, maybe 10:02 pm, everyone began to shuffle out. My neon wristband somehow transported me all the way to the outside of the green room, where I recognized their bassist and saw who I assume was someone’s girlfriend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b37fa97c19b48c97a040c67d16013ce/tumblr_inline_p9pwckzynR1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eI decided that I could fake my professionalism no longer before I inevitably get in over my head and make a fool of myself, so I retreated out the front door and into the night. If I learned anything from the experience, it is that I am still underwhelmed by HOMESHAKE’s performances (despite my optimism) and that neon wristbands can afford you special privileges like you wouldn’t believe. Whether I was deserving of all those privileges, I am not so sure, but I am grateful for them nonetheless.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

The album pulls listeners by the gut with a deep melancholy ambivalence - there is almost no need for comprehension, only experience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLiz Harris stated in a press release that the album is meant to carve out “The space left after matter has departed, a stage after the characters have gone, the hollow of some central column, missing\u0026hellip;\u0026ldquo; and it does just that, occupying a suspended state between what has been and what could be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith only 7 tracks lasting a total of 22 minutes, the album is much shorter than most, but as Harris herself has said: it’s complete. And it feels that way, or maybe it doesn’t, but that kind of seems to be the point.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSongs end just as you think they’re about to begin. Piano keys are slippery, dropping off into a void prematurely and leaving an emptiness where it feels like there should be something, anything. These subtle hints toward the accidental and unpolished mimic the brevity and disintegration of the album itself.  By the time “Breathing,”  the final track on the album, reached its end, I felt like I inhabited the same placid emptiness that Harris found when she wrote the album in the rural state of Wyoming.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first track on the album, “Races,” begins with static. I almost questioned whether my headphones were working, but it was soon replaced by a soft voice, hymn-like in its demand for solemn reverence and respect. Breaths populate the lengthy gaps between lyrics and instrumentals. Though seemingly haphazard, they claim a central space within the piece serving to generate a purposeful disquietude.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Parking Lot” begins after another bout of uncomfortable fuzz-filled moments. Strong piano keys interrupt the almost-silence and a raw voice soon joins in with a similarly angelic twinge as in “Races.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe piano here is simplistic and uncertain, but rather than seeming unskilled it bears a certain weight, holding the emotions in balance. The keys threaten to become overbearing but carefully shrink back avoiding a melancholy only narrowly kept at bay throughout the entire project. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe album follows its path toward a continual, unplaced longing. Between the tracks, moments of unfilled air create an absent-mindedness that could almost have been caused by a simple overlooked “record” button.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe lyrics of each song are simple, short and repetitive in some cases and they seem secondary to the innate emotion present in the tones and careful notes. Each word is drawn out past its end, heavy in a way that contradicts the high pitch. They’re enveloped in a light sadness, creating a difficulty of comprehension which builds an incessant desire for answers that are only met with disappointment. Though each track has its own specific flavor, they all follow toward what can’t be defined.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis short album asks that you sit with this restless uncertainty quietly. If the album continued on any longer, it would be nearly infuriating. Poised at the edge of an obscure brink, stuck between something and its completion is a locale that proves to be nearly unbearable. To be pressed against such a precipice for longer than 22 minutes would instill a permanence of emptiness that makes me uneasy. \u003ci\u003eGrid of Points\u003c/i\u003e carefully spans the liminal space between expectation and reality, forcing us towards neither and ending before the limbo finds purchase outside our headphones.\u003c/p\u003e",

So I was kind of curious because I’ve seen in some different interviews that when you play live, you play with a different band every time, like playing with a 12-piece or 8-piece – so I’m curious how each show is different and morphed together, especially because this album (\u003ci\u003eGod First\u003c/i\u003e) is jazzier and kind of the influences of playing live.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS:\u003c/b\u003e I think the whole thing has been a reaction to being in a sort of, very tight, rehearsed band for 10 years, which was Bombay Bicycle Club. So you play the same set every night, in the same way, and there’s nothing wrong with that – it was really fun and I loved it. But it got to the point where I wanted to do the opposite of that, so something looser, something where if you make a mistake, it doesn’t matter – it’s almost encouraged, something interesting could happen. And change the songs up all the time, change the band, just be a bit looser. But that’s just a case of something getting saturated, which was how I played in Bombay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAC:\u003c/b\u003e Since there were so many collaborations, how many people did it take to complete the album?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS: \u003c/b\u003eQuite a few…But just the right amount\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAC:\u003c/b\u003e I have a couple questions about your music videos because those are always really cool.

Because you can be a little more experimental, you can let your imagination run a bit further because you don’t want to be disappointed by a director saying, “I love your idea but it just can’t happen.” And secondly, I don\u0026rsquo;t like being in videos so this is a way for me to be in it in a way I was comfortable with it, which is like an avatar or some weird alter ego.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FkuBP97qEwvU\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kuBP97qEwvU?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAC: \u003c/b\u003eAnd for “Leap of Faith” and “Angels” video, they both have a space-y theme to it.

To do it at quite a young age is very strange because we obviously had a lot of success as Bombay Bicycle Club. And you get to a point, I was probably about 26, where you’re like, “You’ve done a lot”. A lot has been achieved. But there’s so much more of your life remaining and it’s a feeling a lot of people have in the later years of their life. And I’m not saying that I’m complacent and think that’s all there’s to do and that I’m satisfied but it is just quite a peculiar way to be at that age…almost like just feeling exhausted sometimes. So much has happened such a short amount of time but you still were young and have this vitality – it’s weird.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAC:\u003c/b\u003e I wonder if this like a quarter-life crisis?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS: \u003c/b\u003eYeah probably!

You didn’t travel by air, you only traveled by ship or train, so which do you prefer?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS:\u003c/b\u003e It’s hard to say, the ship was amazing. It was the only time I’ve been on a long voyage on a ship but I loved it. They’re both great – anything that allows you to just daydream all day, just look out the window and not have any responsibilities is fine by me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAC:\u003c/b\u003e I read that when you were on the freight company Hanjin, some of the crew recorded songs in the studio that you made.

They were incredibly corny love songs for their families back home – how much they missed them. I’m not saying it wasn’t emotional but it was cheesy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAC:\u003c/b\u003e We usually do some fun questions on the air, just to break the ice a little bit.

I basically went from buying records in shops to just going on YouTube and listening to channels. And it’s such a transition but it’s a really healthy scene. It’s growing and I think a lot of people don’t know about it. They’re like, “What’s people listening to now? What’s music become?” Go on these channels which have millions of subscribers, of people just hanging out or studying or living their life listening to these great, live mixtapes…and all that vaporwave stuff. I feel like that’s where everyone is right now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAC:\u003c/b\u003e It’s a really interesting way of discovering music now. You’ll hear a sample and you’re just like, “Wow, that’s really soulful and just full of love,” and you’ll just go and try to find out. It just sparks this…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS:\u003c/b\u003e You’ve gone down a rabbit hole\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAC: \u003c/b\u003eYeah, and now there’s a fascination with 70s soul and funk music that I just really appreciate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS: \u003c/b\u003eOh that’s beautiful. That’s what happens with sampling. And it’s all just bedroom producers, which I think is amazing.

With Mr Jukes, how did this manifest what it is now, was it just something you’ve been thinking about, maybe the past couple of years or has it just been something always gnawing at you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS:\u003c/b\u003e I’ve always been making stuff on the side which is all the Soundcloud stuff, even when I was touring with Bombay Bicycle Club. And I guess I just took some time off to do this project properly. And it has kind of spiraled and snowballed. Like it could’ve just been a bedroom hip-hop record like what we were just talking about. And you just get more ambitious like I have the resources to get some musicians on it and book a studio and take it out of the bedroom. Now I’m just some guy making beats into something else. And so I did. And it kind of grew in that way. You could take all those songs…if I just played you the demos, it would just be bedroom production so I guess that’s the difference.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAC:\u003c/b\u003e How do you feel about recording in a studio in your own home?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS:\u003c/b\u003e I’ve gone through so many different phases. I just left my studio in a big emotional “Fuck you, I’m leaving now” because I hated it. But because I’ve been there such a long time, I started to miss being at home and I felt like I was changing because I was in a professional environment. So now I’m back in my bedroom now. I think a lot of artists go through a cycle and they get bored of their bedroom and want all the fancy equipment. And they spend a couple years with the fancy equipment and get nostalgic for the pureness that was in their bedroom. And it’s just a cycle basically.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAC:\u003c/b\u003e Okay last question, did you use GarageBand back in the day?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJS:\u003c/b\u003e I didn’t, I had a Windows computer but it was something similar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAC:\u003c/b\u003e Thank you so much for your time!\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

You look 21.” My evening started with some nice and surprised greetings from the security guards at the bar section. Granted, they had their reasons to make the assumption. The audience at the Perfume Genius concert looked significantly older than the regular concert crowds I’m used to. I expected the audience to be a lot younger for some reasons (probably because there are usually a lot of queer youth at queer artists’ concerts), even though the music of Perfume Genius is known to be sensual, mature and evocative.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009When a purple hue took over the stage, the opening act Big Thief walked on the stage gracefully and casually. The crowd, instead of screaming cheerfully, welcomed the band as if they were just some old friends. Without any sort of introduction, Big Thief jumped straight into playing the first number on their last album, “Pretty Things.” I had very minimal knowledge of the band, but their dream-like, soothing style was exactly what I needed. I remember zooming out and staring at the colored smokescreen\u0026ndash;not because they were not interesting enough for me to remain focus, but simply because the Mayan was then a completely different utopian dimension under the soothing melodies. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1012\" data-orig-width=\"1538\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e7ef08864dddac13c557196838552ddc/tumblr_inline_p7m19aqP2H1qhakxc_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1012\" data-orig-width=\"1538\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009During the intermission I walked around the venue for a bit. The Mayan is unique in the sense that it was made to resonate with the Mayan culture. Though I’m not sure whether the interior decor was simply a sign of cultural appropriation, the sights of Mayan masks and columns inside the theatre did make the medium size venue look more grand and exotic. People were either rushing towards the bar area or towards the merch stand. With a few lovely couples left on the dance floor swaying in the company of each other, very spontaneously I chatted with a pair of strangers, and came out to them as well. This was going to be a good night for everyone, simply because of the welcoming atmosphere created by the excited queer community and allies who were there for a great show. I felt safe being myself with the strangers there, I think everyone else felt safe as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009It was worth the wait after all. In a similar fashion, the band got on gracefully. But now the crowd was cheering, and the long-waited screams were finally let out as Mike Hadreas, the lead singer took the stage. After showing off his shiny silver suit and making a few quirky face at the crowd, Perfume Genius was no longer just “Mike”\u0026ndash; he was ready to put on a show only he was capable of doing. The pianist started playing the intro for “No Shape,” the night was now heated and the crowd was ready for a phenomenal show.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1014\" data-orig-width=\"1531\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/636d37d96ee70a921c83e9235e65627e/tumblr_inline_p7m1a0G1wB1qhakxc_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1014\" data-orig-width=\"1531\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eI went to the back after the first three songs. Already head over heels from the luring, seductive energy that was filling up the venue, I was witnessing two shows. Under the whimsical rainbow-like lights and the echoey, alluring voice of Hadreas, people in the back were dedicated to dancing their night away. In the best way possible, couples were now free from the odd stares of bystanders (although here I was, staring). People had their own dance moves to accompany Hadreas’ strange yet beautiful movements on stage, free of judgement and worry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1023\" data-orig-width=\"1543\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b247e092fdd6e190bfeea303ada95cd7/tumblr_inline_p7m1auv5jo1qhakxc_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1023\" data-orig-width=\"1543\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe whole night felt more like a gathering of passionate people than a concert. People were there to dance to the great beats and enjoy each other’s company. The only difference between this and a regular Thursday night was that Perfume Genius, sounding almost exactly the same as their recorded music, was giving one of the best shows ever. Nobody remembered when Hadreas took off his jacket, nobody remembered the clear order of set list even though the amazing live performances of “Die 4 You,” “Wreath,” “Sides,” and many more songs from both the new and older albums were now carved in everyone’s memories. Towards the end of the show, the rest of the band left the stage. Hadreas played a few acoustic songs, magically sang in an even more dreamy voice. He brought \n\nAlan Wyffels, his long-term partner and band member onto the stage again. Together they played the piano in such a playful yet loving manner. I’m sure their Coachella show just the day after was drastically different, but I’m sure the accepting and welcoming vibe of this night was just equally as memorable for Perfume Genius as that huge, glorious stage in the dessert.\u003c/p\u003e",

The film is about a gay high school student Simon who has a secret online friendship with another gay student, Blue, but here’s the catch: Simon is being blackmailed. Martin has discovered Simon’s conversation thread, and in exchange for not outing Simon, Simon must help him get a girlfriend.\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI originally discovered this story when I read \u003ci\u003eSimon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda\u003c/i\u003e and fell in love with the humor and flirtation between Blue and Simon. The book was focused on the agency of coming out, but it was also about friendship, theatre, and Oreos. There isn’t a novel that has caused me to giggle more than this one and I would highly recommend giving it a read. I came into the theatre skeptical over its ability to fully portray the charm of the book, and while it isn’t as moving as the novel, \u003ci\u003eLove, Simon\u003c/i\u003e portrayed the quirks of growing up while maintaining its central focus of LGBT themes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis film does not shy away from the reality of being gay in a southern city, but it’s still lighthearted. While emotional, gut wrenching LGBT narratives are important to showcase, sometimes you want a cute, fluffy film about two gay guys who fall in love over email. You want a lovable friend group that supports the protagonist and supportive parents who are trying their best. It’s serious when it needs to be, but this is as much of a coming of age story as it is a coming out one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of my biggest criticisms of the film is that I wish it showed more of the dialogue between Blue and Simon that was in the novel. The book had inside jokes, their interests, how they saw the world - the film only really featured the parts of their conversations that talked about being gay. Perhaps this was to ensure that the film was focused, but as someone who adored these parts of the book, I was disappointed by how little Blue’s personality was shown. I was also perturbed by how over-the-top Martin was; he’s not only annoying but downright clueless, and he came off as too strong to seem realistic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite this, I cannot discount what the film does well: its humor, the fact that it’s 2018 and we need more representation in the media, its acknowledgment of gay stereotypes, and its accurate portrayal of friend groups. The characters do not exist simply to support or bully Simon; they are complex in their own right, with side stories of their own. Simon’s parents are endearingly flawed, and you cannot help but love how much they love Simon. The film doesn’t simplify Simon to his sexuality. He is not only gay \u0026ndash; he is funny, a bit awkward, and caring. The film ends with you wanting more of this endearing romance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUltimately, \u003ci\u003eLove, Simon\u003c/i\u003e is a heartwarming romance that deserves the praise it has been getting. Albertalli has created wonderful characters that you want to be your best friends (except Martin), and they come alive in this film. Support representation. Support art that does it right.\u003c/p\u003e",

Chicago’s most talented rapper and R\u0026amp;B hit-maker, respectively, crafted a Christmas mixtape that has a taste of both the present-day hip hop and the traditional tunes to gift the listeners with. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eMerry Christmas Lil’ Mama: Rewrapped\u003c/i\u003e, composed of a Disc One and Disc Two, has nine tracks in each. Although they are very similar, Disc Two has all the new tracks that are released and Disc One is a reminder for the former mixtape. In both tapes, we hear Jeremih’s tender seductive vocals with Chance’s Chicago referenced and holiday spirited rap verses. The overall sense of the tapes has the typical warmth of gospel and soul with low ends from the artists. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith “Family For,” Chance goes bold with his sincere statements of, “Where they ain’t scared to say the name of the Savior,” through rich vocal harmonies and clean guitar strums to state his perspective on recent political incidents. He also touches on family in tracks like “Held It Down,” again through bold and sincere statements like if anyone touches his family, he won’t hold himself back, and say your “ugly ass family, your great-great grandmammy shoulda used Plan B.” In tracks like “Big Kid Again,” both Chance and Jeremih go festive with the backing up of a children’s choir and state how they try to fulfill their children’s Christmas lists in real life. At parts, some tracks go sentimental, like “One More Cry,” which is dominated with Jeremih’s soulful choruses and Chance’s confessional verses. Within the same track, Chance touches on politics, his family memories, and Biblical influences. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe stand out track is The Jackson Five’s “I Want You Back\u0026quot; influenced “Stranger at the Table,” yet with a piano remix. Chance is again honest with his statements in this track, confessing that “last Christmas was a war zone.” Following the same success is “Shoulda Left You,” in which Chance reminisces on David Bowie and Prince along with Jeremih in the chorus, trying to reject the tearful memories that happened in 2016. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, \u003ci\u003eMerry Christmas Lil’ Mama: Re-Wrapped,\u003c/i\u003e with its lyrical and musical attributes, is a reminder of sharing and love throughout the holiday season, brought to you by Chicago’s very own Chance the Rapper and Jeremih.\u003c/p\u003e",

However, only referring to Wong as “Vulfpeck’s rhythm guitarist” would be a great disservice to the wonderful library of music and multimedia works he has compiled since 2016. With his new release \u003ci\u003eCory Wong and The Green Screen Band\u003c/i\u003e, Wong lays down an incredible set of musical variety, proving his dominance as a guitarist, songwriter, composer, and videographer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom the get go we’re confronted with a funky track that not only features Wong’s prowess as a rhythm guitarist, but also enlists the help of a swaggering horn section, and the lush tones of vocalist Antwaun Stanley. As a relatively safe tune that doesn’t extend outside the bounds of 1960s-inspired funk, “Work It Out” seems like the natural choice to start the album off. Though echoes of Curtis Mayfield and James Brown manifest themselves in the beginning of the album, Wong chooses not to pigeonhole himself into the classic funk archetype, and delivers a plethora of varied compositions with their focuses turned to the rhythm section. In the next few songs, we hear a menagerie of tempos and grooves, the inclusion of acoustic instrumentation, and another catchy non-instrumental. This all culminates to distinct break from the rest of the album with the fifth track, “Clouds,” a beautifully rich composition oozing with layers of sound. The band’s lush tone and harmonically complex phrasing helps deliver an intimacy previously unheard in Wong’s music, deepening the range of the album in a manner that both grooves \u003ci\u003eand\u003c/i\u003e soothes. The middle of the record seems like the perfect place for this particular brand of tune, an unexpectedly sensitive one that cleanses the auricular palate before diving right back into the funk buffet that is the album’s final five songs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eCory Wong and The Green Screen Band\u003c/i\u003e is a completely cohesive listening experience that engages the listener with its impressive musicianship and inviting jams, appealing to a wide variety of listeners. It is low volume funk so delicious that it will truly make you wonder why Jack Stratton of Vulfpeck has yet to even mention the album anywhere on his many popular social media platforms.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003earticle and photographs by Gomi Zhou\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe decade of 2010s has been a wild ride for pop music. While the American pop scene is relatively uniform and homogeneous, European pop artists (in my opinions) have definitely experimented with way more different pop elements. Incoming from Sweden, Tove Styrke remains as a breath of fresh air in the global pop swirl.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn her now almost-ten-years-long journey as a pop artist, Styrke has always been experimenting with various sub-branches in pop including Euro-disco, synth-pop, and electro-pop; though, her newest album, \u003ci\u003eSway\u003c/i\u003e, can easily be fit into the branch of dream pop. Based on my understanding of Styrke prior to the show, she is definitely someone who has a clear vision of where she’s heading, and, she’s completely fearless about heading towards it. She has all the potentials to become a global sensation, and her sharp, confident personality definitely shines through from her songs and videos.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5236\" data-orig-height=\"3491\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/74f324126db4ceba3153323620edae5c/tumblr_inline_pgxluazTLf1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5236\" data-orig-height=\"3491\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the illusion-like, cinematic set of the opening artist Au/Ra, the crew brought out a full stage of rose lights. Instantly, the crowd was ignited by the allegory to \u003ci\u003eSway\u003c/i\u003e even before the roses had ever flickered. Shortly after that, Styrke struck onto the stage as the roses started to shine through in all the prettiest pastel colors. Dressed in a shiny black suit, topped with a playful “TOVE STYRKE” logo cowboy hat, “Borderline” somehow actually sounded like a Western cowboy song at that moment. Following the first song, she continued to perform a few more jazzy, upbeat numbers such as “Mistakes”, “Ego” and “On A Level”. Instead of performing songs purely from her latest record, Styrke provided tunes from both \u003ci\u003eSway\u003c/i\u003e and her last album from 2015, \u003ci\u003eKiddo\u003c/i\u003e. By this point, it is clear to me that even though her musical style is always progressing, there are certain consistent elements that would always get preserved. Even though her lyrics are not always sunshine and rainbow, but her music always delivers comfort and encouragement to people who might not be easily understood (introverts, LGBTQ+, etc.).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5472\" data-orig-height=\"3648\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/88832e7fa3781b7b252948084ae72b48/tumblr_inline_pgxlvk7MTV1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5472\" data-orig-height=\"3648\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThroughout the night, Styrke had barely ever stopped interacting with fans. She kept making eye contacts with different people in the front rows while constantly pacing from one side of the stage to another. Her audience on the other hand, responded with enthusiasm by dancing and singing along with the artist. “Wow you guys are singing louder than me!”, she said to her fans with a bright smile on her face during a slower song called “On The Low”. The way Styrke interacted with fans was very casual and genuine, just like many other European pop artists who I had seen before. Perhaps there’s something about a smaller, more intimate crowd in a foreign place that can just warm the hearts of both the artists and the fans to a completely different level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/23041256eb646884e1fb803bd2f42940/tumblr_inline_pgxm121vVP1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"1080\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eI gradually realized that even though the whole show had an upbeat energy, it only got more and more intense as it went on. By the time Styrke started singing the last few songs, the crowd was so energetic that everyone seemed to be boiling with happiness. Many fans were holding up signs, while others were now dancing with their new acquaintances. The energy of the venue turned the show into that of a massive teen party, except filled with people from all ages and all backgrounds. And Tove Styrke herself was not just a performer, she was part of the crowd. After the show, many fans stayed after to meet Styrke by the merch stand. Most of them were holding roses that Styrke threw into the crowd during the last song. The meet and greet line lasted for more than an hour, but even so, Styrke greeted every fan with her fairy-like smile. I began to believe that the roses are some sort of symbols. With her humble gratitude and willingness to explore, there is so much more to be expected from Tove Styrke.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3142\" data-orig-height=\"3142\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a4f06037ff8957c33bea218f0ef65fb9/tumblr_inline_pgxm3xK5Hb1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3142\" data-orig-height=\"3142\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

I march over to the exit, look up at the moonlit sky, inhale deeply, and exhale my relief. I have officially finished my first year at UCLA. My phone illuminates the dark \u0026ndash; \u003ci\u003e9:15pm, Monday, June 11th\u003c/i\u003e. I run across campus to my partner’s car. It’s time to celebrate and witness the elusive creative genius, George Evelyn, known as his alter ego, Nightmares on Wax.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"4618\" data-orig-height=\"3080\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d72c9b93c9ce3c21119162d8d67e27ac/tumblr_inline_pc39orrOWh1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4618\" data-orig-height=\"3080\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvelyn’s journey of self-discovery has flourished his expertise as a musician. His enthusiasm of music began with his household engrossed with Afro-Carribean Calypso, the dreamy jazz vibratos of Sarah Vaughn, poetics of Quincy Jones, and the politically conscious soul of Curtis Mayfield. As a teenager in Leeds, England, Evelyn joined and curated mix tapes for the breakdance crew, Solar City Rockers inspired by Rappers Delight and Buffalo Gals. In 1991, Evelyn made a name for himself as a pioneering DJ mixing influences of the 80’s/90’s rave scene of England, hip-hop, and reggae.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor nearly 3 decades, Nightmares on Wax has swooned fans with his experimental discography inspired by his emotionally driven and positive soul. Nightmares on Wax is my go-to artist to truly take a second to breathe and reconfigure. The essence of his music has encouraged me during midterm/final seasons when I have lost motivation and concentration, my meditations to reconnect to nature, and my stellar dance moves that are unearthed only to Evelyn’s signature grooves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn January 2018, he released the genre-bending masterpiece, \u003ci\u003eShape the Future\u003c/i\u003e. Nightmares on Wax’s creation of his latest record is inspired by the inward and outward journey he has embarked on all over the world.

The stage is smaller than most Los Angeles venues, but the quaint intimacy it provides is transcending.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe lights dim, the curtains open, and Nightmares on Wax finally walks on to the stage. He is in a simple black t-shirt, black headphones, a brown baseball cap, cargo shorts, red sneakers, and an intricately multicolored tie made out of beads. He begins smudging (a ceremony of burning sage to bring positive energy to a space) and behind me, a woman whispers to her partner, “Is that a huge joint?” Her partner laughs and replies, “No, that’s sage.” Its scent and excitement fills up his fans. The Fonda is now jam packed with souls of all ages. There are middle-aged women with purple hair, young teens in berets and sailor caps, and OG fans in the very back are hooting and swaying N.O.W’s vinyl records, \u003ci\u003eSmoker’s Delight\u003c/i\u003e from 1995 and \u003ci\u003eCarboot Soul\u003c/i\u003e from 1999.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Nightmares on Wax stage is now hazy and forces you to consider whether you’ve stepped into the Fonda or his living room. On stage is a \u003ci\u003etresillo\u003c/i\u003e, in Spain this is a living room set with 2 arm chairs and a 3-seater-sofa. Nightmares on Wax continues to spread the sage with a fan and seats his mind, spirit, and body on the 3-seater-sofa. In front of him is a coffee table laden with his keyboards, synthesizers, computer, and mixers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5597\" data-orig-height=\"3729\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e04d48079534cd10338f26058daf8fea/tumblr_inline_pc39qhrn3w1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5597\" data-orig-height=\"3729\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eA confidence spreads on Nightmares on Wax’s face as he puts the sage out. He has officially cleansed the negative energy of his field and begins his magic. His drummer, Grant Kershaw, in a red shirt, blue jeans, and sneakers then seats himself on the drum kit to N.O.W’s left. Kershaw begins the beat to “Back to Nature.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe stage behind them has two 50-inch TVs with stands in the back playing his music video for “Back to Nature.” The harmonious and utopian music video is a culmination of magazine cutouts, postcards, and vintage films created by Joao Pombiero. In the middle of the TVs is a banner reminiscent of \u003ci\u003eShape the Future\u003c/i\u003e’s album cover.  A woman next to me with thick white glasses, a striking white mohawk, and the tattooed word “Destiny” taking up her left arm screams, “I love you! Thank you for your existence. Welcome back!” and begins dancing in a circle with all her jubilant friends.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“\u003ci\u003eAll humans share one spirit. All humans share a consciousness… All human thought vibrates at a certain frequency. We’re all in communication. When you exhale, I breathe the air you breathe…\u003c/i\u003e”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Back to Nature” is a song of affirmation, mindfulness, and swagger. In the time of 2018’s political fascism, the purity, clarity, and understanding of this tune are healing. “Back to Nature” features Nightmares on Wax’s instrumentation, the voice of spiritual leader Kuauhtli Vasquez, and a hikuru/chant that was recorded at a ceremony in Sacbe, Mexico by the Wixarika Tribe. Together in consciousness and thought, the elixirs of “Back to Nature” curate a poignant beginning to the night.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FVc-XzhnwpVc\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vc-XzhnwpVc?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eA champagne bottle behind the armchair on the left is picked up by British and Barbadian singer, Sadie Walker. Walker is striking in red flowy pants, doc martens, and a geometrically cut top. Following Walker, English singer, songwriter, producer, and Rihanna’s brother (!!), Leigh Stephen Kenny/LSK takes a seat on the right armchair. LSK is an ascot cap with a denim jacket that conceals his shirt with only “LIT” emblazoned on the front. LSK is a longtime friend and collaborator of Evelyn’s. LSK has also curated most of Evelyn’s artwork for his albums. Tonight, LSK takes on the role of one of N.O.W’s vocalists.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWalker pours champagne for herself and her bandmates. In succession, I feel as if I’ve somehow walked into a private scene of N.O.W and his best friends hanging and jamming out at his house. As if on cue, fans scream and applaud uproariously. I am reminded that this is a concert - and an intoxicating one at that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWalker, Kershaw, LSK, and N.O.W’s infectious smiles and ability to vibe as a cerebral unit is mesmerizing. LSK’s solid and thunderous voice accompanies N.O.W and Kershaw’s polished drumming during “Shape the Future”, “Tell my Vision”, and “Play Video.” A woman in a red boat hat that conceals her face is cuddled up with her husband in a red flannel to match. They embrace and smile up at the stage as N.O.W plays his famous hit, “Les Nuits.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5640\" data-orig-height=\"3757\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3f22319f5a9a7bd456df15ddce883219/tumblr_inline_pc39r5sWoW1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5640\" data-orig-height=\"3757\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eI listened to this track while studying for the final I took just hours ago. I place my hand on my thumping heart to the live bass and it all feels extremely surreal. The crowd becomes electric as individuals proudly dance in their own worlds and jump in rhythm to “You Wish” and “Citizen Kane.” As the crowd settles, Sadie stands from her sofa and her breathtaking vibratos are undeniable during “Deep Shadows.” LSK’s trademark harmonically-rich vocalizations power up “Flip Ya Lid” and everyone begins to bump into each other as the beat takes over our bodies. Kershaw’s begins a percussion-soaked drum solo. All eyes are on him and N.O.W looks proudly at his exceptional drummer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLSK, Sadie, Kershaw, and N.O.W make moves to exit the stage, but N.O.W snickers and whispers “We’re coming back, don’t worry.” As promised, they assemble themselves back on stage and N.O.W takes center stage with the mic and sings the feel-good lyrics of “Be I Do.” Afterward, the funky and deliciously groovy tempo of “Da Feelin” pulsates the dancefloor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor all the concerts I have attended, the laid-back yet mind-blowing performance N.O.W has provided proves his genuinity. He does not need costumes, backup dancers, or intricate lights. His virtuosity is supplied by his encapsulating energy and positive soul. George Evelyn is not just a DJ, producer, writer, and spiritual conductor - but, also a humanitarian and activist. N.O.W remarkably comments on his privilege as an artist and beckons his fans to help support change in the lives of others and make a difference, no matter how small.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5445\" data-orig-height=\"3630\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/24d9f25b6b72291da8585ae3be35d936/tumblr_inline_pc39romf8i1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5445\" data-orig-height=\"3630\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe begins a speech on  his collaboration with the foundation Last Night a Dj Saved my Life.

The art deco, near-turquoise colored theater is an instantly recognizable spot for anyone looking for something to do in LA, accentuated by its towering height and imposing stature and lighting along Wilshire Boulevard. May 11th, 2018 was one of those nights, and Unknown Mortal Orchestra, the psychedelic indie rock band formed by Ruban Nielson, was set to play.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnknown Mortal Orchestra is a cultural hybrid of a band, hailing from both Auckland, New Zealand, and Portland, Oregon. They first received significant attention as a band after their first, mysterious Bandcamp release “Ffunny Ffriends,” which would later appear on their debut self-titled LP, received critical and audience praise. Fast forward 8 years later, and the band has seen significant success and growth, topped with the release of their fourth and latest album, \u003ci\u003eSex \u0026amp; Food\u003c/i\u003e, in April and an accompanying tour. The tour kicked off in late April in Northampton, MA, and has finally made its way through California and the heart of Los Angeles at the Wiltern. The sold-out audience was prepared to hear their favorite lo-fi indie rock band perform a trippy set. What they got was a bit more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"4960\" data-orig-height=\"3307\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b43361e37857007fd8d8228a3dc8fb83/tumblr_inline_pa2mbda6X01qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4960\" data-orig-height=\"3307\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThose familiar with the Wiltern already know of its intricately-designed art deco interior. From the general admission, one can admire the geometrical ceiling and the column-like walls that rise up towards it. A swooping balcony looms over the ground level, the latter segmented for optimal audience views. On the stage was Unknown Mortal Orchestra’s setup. White fur rugs covered parts of the temporary platforms built on stage, providing a soft cushion for the electronic keyboards and drum set. A pristine, IKEA-like table sat at the very front; atop it, a white record player with two speakers. Below the table were vinyl records proudly displayed from, perhaps, Ruban’s personal collection, including an unusual Miles Davis record, \u003ci\u003eYou’re Under Arrest\u003c/i\u003e. Forming the backdrop of the stage was a light fixture with five columns of shelves, each shelf carrying rows of the same leafy plant. Each column was aligned with LED light strings on each side. Between each shelf were spotlights, vertically aligned. At rest, all of these lights emitted a brilliant pink hue, almost as if the audience were looking into a portal that leads to the cover of Unknown Mortal Orchestra’s album art for \u003ci\u003eMulti-Love\u003c/i\u003e, but we’ll get into that later.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6de754e992b9d788da9a36b13edd1d6c/tumblr_inline_pa2mabrecK1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy the time I reached the show, Unknown Mortal Orchestra’s opener, Makeness, had already begun. A one-man act, Makeness took multiple duties as instrumentalist, programmer, and vocalist for his opening act. His performances more or less involved stacking multiple layers to establish a groove, creating programmable drum patterns on repetitive synth patterns to sonically support his higher register vocals. Makeness produced dance-pop sentiments on stage and maintained a DIY-like attitude with the one-man act setup, complimenting Unknown Mortal Orchestra’s pop-indie-psychedelia hybrid sound and lo-fi background that are well known to the audience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1fa6aebae8257564145bcc4405c3accf/tumblr_inline_pa2mbrqvI91qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e45 minutes and a couple of soundchecks later, Unknown Mortal Orchestra took the stage, and, as if making a poetic gesture reflecting on the band’s career, started off the show with “Ffunny Ffriends,” the song that started it all. The roars from the audience alone indicated that they knew what was to come. Unknown Mortal Orchestra delivered an outstanding career-spanning set, surprisingly playing a decent distribution of songs from each of their four albums. Some rare surprises were a performance of the self-titled LP’s “Nerve Damage!”, to which Ruban introduced, “This next song is so old, you guys probably won’t even know it.” A significant number of songs from II were performed, including the fan-favorite for singalongs “So Good At Being In Trouble” as well as “Swim and Sleep Like A Shark.” Given the band had just released \u003ci\u003eSex \u0026amp; Food\u003c/i\u003e a month before, it was apparent Unknown Mortal Orchestra would perform almost the entire album live, performing fan favorites like the groovy “Hunnybee” and seamless transitions between “Major League Chemicals” and the fiery “American Guilt.” One particular moment I liked was the fact that they added precise detail to the show by playing a recording (albeit, a distorted, skipped version of a recording) of “A God Called Hubris” while introducing the band’s stage crew before transitioning right into a live rendition of “Major League Chemicals”. Hell, even “Chronos Feasts On His Children” got a performance in the encore!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d86cc28786f68c534104d4a3400bda60/tumblr_inline_pa2mc3uSdQ1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe setlist is just one aspect of the show; Unknown Mortal Orchestra has proven that they’ve refined the art of the performance. Many of the songs were open to improvisation, from long-running guitar solos at the end of “From the Sun” to even occasional saxophone textures in the more psychedelic renditions. One highlight of the performance was, during the extended solo in the outro of “From The Sun,” Ruban ran off stage, gracing his guitar still plugged into a “wireless” amp. For a good minute, he was off stage while still soloing, until cheers grew louder and louder from the balcony; he had run up to the balcony all while continuing his improvised guitar solo. He teetered over the edge of the balcony, overlooking the general admission crowd who turned around when they realized where he was, as hoards of fans on the balcony roared and took selfies with him at the bottom of the balcony.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/544e13826d7d3fa22c3634fba4cc4c62/tumblr_inline_pa2mciX1cm1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe band played every beat and note that has existed in their respective recordings but added even more on top of it in improvisation. Fans of Unknown Mortal Orchestra may also note that seeing a live performance of theirs is much “cleaner” than their recordings; while Ruban stays true in using the appropriate effects on the guitar to replicate the sounds fans have come to love in his records, Ruban doesn’t use any filters on his voice to maintain the lo-fi aesthetic in live shows, leaving his raw voice out in the mix, which can arguably make the show a bit more unique and appealing for fans. Visually, the lighting effects on stage, mentioned earlier, deviated from its constant pink hue at resting state, using rotating beams, vibrant strobe lights, and saturated colors across the spectrum to transform the stage into Unknown Mortal Orchestra’s personal kaleidoscope, perfectly in sync with their music. The sound and visual setup complemented each other in the show’s psychedelic yet laid-back attitude, and the audience of dedicated fans seemed to enjoy every second of it, calling out the next tracks and dancing the night away.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

The show, basically a homecoming for the group that originated in Chino, California, was an eclectic celebration of music, and it highlighted all of the things that make us fall in love with music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I finally entered The Fonda, I looked around and noticed how tiny and claustrophobic The Fonda Theater happened to be. The pit isn’t very large, it only goes back about 10-15 rows, so most of the seating is in the balcony above the floor. The outside of the theater has an old marquee that reminds me more of a community theater for children than a concert venue. The theater looks like a relic of a time long gone, and it reminded me that time can be ever so fleeting. That thought prompted me to stay in the moment for as long as I could.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"4908\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a970ee6c6d91228dfada5ce627859180/tumblr_inline_p9i2tr5FN21qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"4908\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere were two opening acts for Echosmith. Seventeen-year-old starlet Jena Rose and indie pop band The Score traveled with Echosmith throughout the country over the last six weeks. Rose recently released a new EP, which I would highly recommend. She may only be seventeen, but her voice is that of a much older, much more mature artist. The Score’s new album \u003ci\u003eAtlas\u003c/i\u003e is the perfect soundtrack to a riot. Needless to say, even before Echosmith went out to perform, I was incredibly amped up and ready for a brilliant show.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut Echosmith’s performance was more than just a show. It was an experience. The show began with one member of the group going up on stage in basically complete darkness with only a little backlighting to give the audience even the smallest idea of what was about to happen. The man started banging a large standalone bass drum in rhythm, almost like a tribal beat. This beat grew as more members of the band joined their compatriot on stage until finally, the lead singer strode out. She was wearing a knee length blue and red dress and began singing. After the first song ended, confetti cannons exploded, and we were drenched in a torrential downpour of colorful paper.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\" style=\"\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6fb6f1fa28a1291c6a48e9c060e2d09e/tumblr_inline_p9i2u2i8MF1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThroughout the night there were moments, both big and small, that made the show particularly memorable. The Score, Jena Rose, and Echosmith were all on stage together at one point, shooting confetti and getting the audience excited during an Echosmith song. The three groups looked like genuine friends, enjoying one last incredible moment together before the tour ended, and they would all have to go their separate ways. Echosmith covered the Killers’ “When You Were Young” and part of the hit Death Cab For Cutie song “I Will Follow You Into the Dark”. These covers, while small moments overall, showed Echosmith’s obvious love for music, and their appreciation for the art form to which they add. Sydney, being the talented band member that she is, even played the drums for a couple of minutes in order to give her tired drummer a well-deserved break. She also threw in a costume change mid-show in order to show the mood shift from pop hits to something slightly more angsty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn exceptionally important moment of the night came when the lead singer, Sydney Sierota, asked for a volunteer to come up on stage. I didn’t think much of it. I had seen this trope done before at concerts. Bring up a loyal fan, dance around with them a little, make them feel special so more people will buy your album or your t-shirt, et cetera et cetera. So imagine my shock when Sierota said the name “Zoey” and called an audience member from the front row on stage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/93a96e22aa8c43e8cccbd3f63a750f7a/tumblr_inline_p9i2mgnTjv1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eZoey ran on stage with all of the excitement of a child who has finally woken up on Christmas morning. She got on stage and hugged Sierota after which, Sierota explained to all of us that she knew Zoey’s name because “She has been with us since the beginning”. All of a sudden, I gained a greater appreciation for the band I was watching. Although I had enjoyed their music up to that point, this simple action added a layer of emotion to the show that I wasn’t expecting. Here is how I understand the relationship between Zoey and the band. Zoey had presumably been to see the band early on in their development, back at a time that all artists go through, the time where the band has maybe six dedicated fans who they know by name. Zoey was one of those dedicated fans. And Sydney remembered her. At that moment, the tiny, claustrophobic theater suddenly felt small and intimate. This band, that, nine years later, has gone double platinum and tours all over the country, still remembers the people who were there since day one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring their song “Goodbye”, giant balloons filled with confetti were thrown into the audience in order for us to simply play and have fun. This added to the mystique of losing oneself in an event rather than a simple show. After “Goodbye”, the show had its obligatory false ending, before the group came back out for its encore and finished things off with “Cool Kids”, their most well-known song, which ended with another tornado of confetti being shot out at the audience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/55cdfb856e143ed5f6ebe68977818484/tumblr_inline_p9i2gk8GCf1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eEchosmith will remind you why you love music.

It was an amazing experience and I got to see the game from the Press Box. LAFC is a new expansion team of the Major League Soccer and this is their first season. Located at Exposition Park, the Banc of California Stadium is a site to behold.\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"4032\" data-orig-height=\"3024\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8afb39e4e70cadd9941c278c4f141736/tumblr_inline_p95smphvje1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4032\" data-orig-height=\"3024\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoth sides on the day featured some major names in soccer. For LAFC, their number 10, Carlos Vela, a Mexican international was the star attraction and for NYCFC, David Villa, a World Cup winner with Spain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe game got off to a fast start with both sides attempting to put quick moves together but it was a VAR (Video Assistant Referee) decision that won NYCFC a penalty. Veteran, David Villa stepped up to take it. The LAFC keeper, Tyler Miller dived on the correct side but Villa headed home the deflection. LAFC were back on equal terms through an own goal as the first half ended.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the second half, LAFC took the lead through Vela. The crowd erupted and the energy was palpable. In the last 20 minutes of the game, NYCFC were attacking and LAFC were on the back foot. Ismael Tajouri-Shradi, a substitute for NYCFC, scored the equalizer. The game ended 2-2.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the game, I had the opportunity to go to the Press Conference where Bob Bradley, the head coach of LAFC and Patrick Vieira, head coach of NYCFC shared their views from the game. In addition to the coaches, I was also in the company of professional sports writers such as LA Times writer Kevin Baxter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"4032\" data-orig-height=\"3024\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/616c140c7e38cba48d4f51d5dcf55cf1/tumblr_inline_p95sl1G7Mz1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4032\" data-orig-height=\"3024\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eNYCFC head coach Patrick Vieira\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI cannot believe that LAFC has just started playing, the passionate fans, the stadium, the chants; Los Angeles has welcomed the team with open arms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"719\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2cc291f9aade4319233dd68473646b7a/tumblr_inline_p95sn1xUzf1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"719\" data-orig-height=\"1280\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eDJ Sahej himself!\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

I’m sure it did not start off that way, so how has touring with people who are also your friends changed your work?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt has influenced me so much. I am kind of one of those people who mostly just listens to whatever my friends are making. I think it\u0026rsquo;s more fulfilling to listen to because if I am sad or bummed out I can just put on my friend’s music and it’s like my friend is just singing to me, and I am very lucky to be surrounded by such talented musicians where I can kind of do that and get by with only listening to my friends’ projects which is so awesome. And I\u0026rsquo;m definitely most inspired by my friends who are, you know, making art and touring and playing shows, and I would always rather watch my friends play than, you know, someone else.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have kind of reached a level of success with tour photography at the point where I can be more selective with who I\u0026rsquo;m touring with, where it\u0026rsquo;s not like, oh, this is the only band willing to take me out like this year, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to do it because I want the experience and I want a tour. I can kind of pick and choose who I\u0026rsquo;m working with and, you know, my best friends are going on tour, I want to go with them and I\u0026rsquo;m now experienced enough so they want to go with me, and I\u0026rsquo;m learning a lot by being so close with my subjects because there\u0026rsquo;s just kind of a level of trust that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have happened had it just been like a random band that hired me. And that is not to say that there is anything wrong with touring with bands that I am less close with but it takes a long time to develop that kind of trust. It will take like two weeks into the tour for you to actually feel like you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable with each other and you\u0026rsquo;re not being like a burden. Everyone is so busy on tour, everyone is exhausted, everyone is doing everything at once, nobody wants to go out and go on a photo adventure, but when it is just your best friends, its like hey, if you don’t have time to do this right now, you tell me, if you do, let’s do it. It\u0026rsquo;s so easy and a lot more exciting because it\u0026rsquo;s more involved and it’s more personal and it’s people I care a lot about. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eI always get spooked out when I use flash, it just feels so invasive.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYeah, it can feel so scary! But like with Ron I am just like in his face, I’m on stage, I’m walking around, I don’t feel like I need to hide behind a curtain where if anyone sees me I am doing it wrong. There is a lot more creative freedom in that situation which is awesome. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"4989\" data-orig-height=\"3135\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/25bc82dc715c13003829c7362b8440a9/tumblr_inline_p7z7zeStZy1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4989\" data-orig-height=\"3135\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eGoing off of that, it seems like you feel a connection between artists and their art, which kind of goes into people disowning music when allegations come out about artists. Where do you see the line being between separating art from the artist and is it okay to continue to have a relationship with their art? \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, obviously, everyone feels very differently about this subject and I would never judge someone for continuing to support someone. Say their friend fucked up and it was an honest mistake and they apologized and they are genuinely trying to get help, like that\u0026rsquo;s awesome, everyone fucks up and everyone deserves a second chance and everyone you know deserves love and respect in their healing process, but I just get so turned off as soon as something sour comes out about someone. Especially if it\u0026rsquo;s someone that you respected or looked up to or like supported in any way, it just feels like such a personal attack, like I can\u0026rsquo;t believe someone that I know did this or like this happen to like my friend, like fuck you forever. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am pretty unforgiving in terms of actually listening to music. For example, if there was someone who did something kind of shitty and they kind of handled it as best they could and they\u0026rsquo;re like I take full accountability and I\u0026rsquo;m so sorry this is me, genuinely apologizing, and here are the steps I\u0026rsquo;m taking to get better, I got sober, I\u0026rsquo;m in therapy, I like contacted this person that I\u0026rsquo;ve hurt. If they are going about it the right way of course they deserve a second chance and of course they deserve to keep making art, but I just won\u0026rsquo;t want to listen to anything that they made because for me I see it as they made this at a time when they are doing the shitty thing and I don\u0026rsquo;t trust them and I don\u0026rsquo;t respect this version of that person therefore I want nothing to do with this and it\u0026rsquo;s going to turn me off and it\u0026rsquo;s not going to be fun to listen to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith that being said there is nothing wrong with having important emotions and memories, all of the emotions and memories you have to certain artists and memories that is totally valid. Those memories should not have to change, but I just can’t do it. I can’t pity someone enough to be like, oh its okay, its still a good album, it makes me feel so good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eYeah, it is tough, because there is just so much out there that it is pretty easy to replace it.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can easily replace any artist, everyone sounds the same, nothing is original. That\u0026rsquo;s actually kind of funny, there should be a website, like oh you found out about this person, here is like five other bands you might like that sound exactly the same. Here are much better humans who make very similar music. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eYou have posted quite a few times about just being considerate of other people at shows, and women specifically. Where do you see this boundary being between being in the moment when experiencing live music and being conscious and considerate and respectful of other people and their boundaries? \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think especially for people it shows who identifies as a woman, like it\u0026rsquo;s so easy to just be the victim of everyone around you. It takes just one shitty person at a show to make you feel like you don’t belong there and you aren’t welcome and nobody cares about your safety and well being. Especially at a show, especially if it is a band who is so progressive and welcoming and kind. I tour with really great people, and that is not always the case of course, but at least for the people I am touring with, if anyone was in the crowd and someone was dancing on them in a way that made them feel uncomfortable or someone was touching them inappropriately, if they got someone on the stage’s attention, that would be it. That person would get kicked out, get sent to the other side of the room, or have security called on them. My friends don’t tolerate that. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs someone who has been the victim of weird things happening to them at shows, I am a lot more aware of my personal space. I feel like it is not hard at all to have fun and dance and have a good time, and even if you are someone who enjoys moshing, that is awesome and there are definitely other people who want to mosh with you and it is so easy to slowly start a mosh pit. You just start slowly, feel it out, test the waters a little bit. If there are people who look uncomfortable, help them get out before you start the pit. Just mosh with the people who want to mosh. People make such a big deal about it and are like, “I just wanna have a good time at the show,” but it’s so easy to also not violate other people’s space. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eI feel like the people who mosh with people who clearly don’t want to are also the people who mosh during the wrong songs too.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYeah! And I hate moshing 99.9 percent of the time because I always have a camera on me, and I have broken a bone at a show before, I have been slammed to the ground and trampled. I have been through all of that shit and I am kind of claustrophobic too. I am usually at the front because I am taking pictures and not paying attention to what is going on behind me, so if you come crashing into me, you are going to smash me to the ground. As I am falling I am gonna protect my camera over my body and end up getting really hurt because you are an insensitive asshole. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eI always get scared of people with drinks, and they start to like lean into you a bit.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd you’re like, I hate that you are ruining this! And then you can’t pay attention to the show at all, you are just looking through you peripheral vision hoping this person won’t crash into you and spill their drink and vomit all over your stuff. It sucks not trusting the people around you at shows. There is a mosh etiquette that most people just don’t understand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWe need to add to our website with the artist redirection -  like how to mosh, how to not spill your drink on someone at a show.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaybe just don’t have a drink on you while you’re moshing. If you are gonna be thrashing around, don’t hold liquids. Easy. There should be mosh cups that are paper, or no, use like a camelback. That would be awesome.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAnother easy add to our website.

I work with a lot of bands who are all straight, white dudes, like zero diversity, but that’s not to say they are uninteresting or bad people. They are so lovely and welcoming and kind and they have really gone out of their way from what I have observed to get women on their shows and trying so hard to work with the female agent instead of the other agent who was recommended to them, or bringing me out not because they feel like they have to but because they want to support me as a female and my work and give me a safe space where they will look out for me. The bands I tour with are also really good at picking up on social cues and I am definitely really vocal about stuff that makes me uncomfortable and I am gonna call them out. Even this tour, all of the guys in Ron Gallo and The Nude Party and Twen have all gone out of their way to check in with me. There was this guy who was super drunk and close to me and talking in my ear and it was totally fine, but I can see how it might look like it was maybe a sketchy situation and Dylan while drumming was looking at me like mouthing, “Are you okay? Is everything good?” He is like looking out for me mid-song! All of the guys I surround myself with have my back. I can’t speak for other touring women, but you can educate your friends and get them on the same page. Like you may have not have had this experience but I have and this is why it’s not okay, and even if you didn’t know before, now you do and you know how to look out for that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eIt is crazy to see how quickly people’s mindsets will change, like as soon as they become aware of this kind of stuff. Even with social media platforms, just the number of people you can reach.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eExactly, I have even had men DM me on Instagram and be like, I had no idea that was happening or still is happening. Thank you for sharing this and now as a guy I can look out for it and help out my female friends. Its really cool to see that -\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e*** \u003ci\u003eCJ was then interrupted by a man who approaches and asks if we need tickets, and when I reply no, he says, “Just send your girlfriends on over to me.” \u003c/i\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eLove the timing. I was just starting to feel warm about everything.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s the thing! I know this is still on the record, but I am just gonna shit talk someone at the show in Santa Cruz. You think you are surrounded by such loyal, loving men who are there to look out for you and it’s awesome and you feel invincible. This tour specifically is full of so many good people and you get in this head space where you are like everything is fine, this is a safe space and you forget that there are external people who come into that group. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere was this one man who comes up to me at the merch table and is like, “Oh, is that your boyfriend?” And I get that question all of the time and I hate it. I’m like, no it’s not, you see me here selling the merch, why would you not assume that it’s my job to sell merch? He just found it really hard to believe instead of being apologetic. And I said no, but why would you assume that I simply must be dating someone on stage? And he said, “I am not assuming that you have to be dating someone.” But like he did! That is the very first thing he said to me, he didn’t even introduce himself! There were people in line and I didn’t have time to talk to him too much and Ron was still doing the encore so it’s kind of hard to hear. And he said, ”Well, so you aren’t dating anyone in the band, what are you doing?” And I am like, let me tell you how many hats I wear on tour and how I work my ass off for these bands and pour my entire heart and soul into this. Let me tell you about all of the jobs I am doing right now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eReally everything except dating them.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYeah that’s exactly it. This man was like, “Sure, well for your sake I hope you are being important and helpful and creative. For your sake I hope one day you can be one tenth the creative genius as that guy on stage.” I just was so mad, I had other people to sell to, I was just done, I can’t be upset right now, and I tried to brush it off. I am usually pretty good at doing that, but I saw him talking to Ron after the set and I was like I need to say something, not to make him feel bad or put him on the spot, but I just needed to tell him that it is not okay to say that to people. So I go up to him and I say, “Hey, man. Next time you see a woman identifying person at a show, don’t assume they are there to sleep with someone in the band. Don’t assume that is their job. If you see someone working a show, assume they are working.” And he was like, “Look, sorry you have some problems you are projecting on me. I am a lot older than you are. I have been to way more shows than you have and scientifically speaking, women at shows are usually dating someone in the band.” And I was like interesting because let me tell you how many shows I have been to in the last five years alone and how few of the women I have interacted with are sleeping with someone in the band and I told him that that is bullshit. He said, “I am a realist, I speak the truth, I am not gonna lie to you to protect your feelings.” I had kind of complained about this guy earlier and in that moment Pat from The Nude Party noticed that I was clearly upset by this guy and he asked me to come help pack stuff up so I had an excuse to get out of it, but I was like, “You’re an asshole!” And he was like, “No I’m not!” I was just shaking I was so mad. Usually someone is close minded and then you explain it to them and they apologize, but he just would not have it. I started crying and it’s so frustrating because people like that are never going to change. They don’t want to change.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eI just never even understand the intention behind it, like what are they getting out of asking you that in the first place, even if you were dating someone?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike what satisfaction would that give you if one of the guys was my husband of twenty years? Now that I have started tour managing too, I love having that say because you’re at the top of the touring crew, so if something like that happens, you can get them kicked out. I like knowing that I can do that to help people out. But that night I just could not handle it and then The Nude Party came to pack up their merch and I am sobbing and they are like, “What happened?” And Alec is like, “What is he wearing, is he still here? I need to talk to him.” And I was like no, no, no, no, no. He just ran outside to try and find him, but he had already left.They are just very good boys. I cannot speak highly enough of them. There are good boys in music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCatch the good boys and sweet gals of Ron Gallo, The Nude Party, and Twen on tour now with CJ. \u003c/p\u003e",

Google lets me know that I’ve arrived and I park in a narrow alley that Angelenos have to call two-way streets, then make my way to the small line formed outside of the warehouse building that otherwise has no indications of housing a venue inside. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe opener, Dizzy, is a four-person band consisting of a female lead singer, two guitarists, and a drummer that also has a pad in front of him and does backup vocals. They’re from Canada, like Milk \u0026amp; Bone, and their sound is reminiscent of an indie pop genre similar to the other band. Katie Munshaw’s voice brightly stands out against a background of mellow guitar tones and steady beats that remind you a little bit of the freedom of adolescence, and a little bit of the stuffiness of suburbia.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMunshaw’s stage presence completely captures me. As she sings lightly and effortlessly, she has the most mischievous smile perched on her face and accompanies every tune with almost signature hand motions, cute in a way only she could pull off. The drummer, however, stands out to me. He vocalizes in the background of one of the songs and it enchants me how he can sing like that in the flesh before my eyes…all the while driving the beat on his drum set. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, Milk \u0026amp; Bone comes out. The female duo from Montreal, Canada is dressed in sporty matching jumpsuits that are both stylish and unique, and they stand behind a large reflective counter that houses their pads and mixing equipment. It was a setup you’d expect to see from any of the hundreds of male EDM duos in existence, a pleasant surprise I hadn’t quite anticipated from them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3456\" data-orig-height=\"5184\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/07dc0da7681008009d5f88a3880a2371/tumblr_inline_p7lwolzetY1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3456\" data-orig-height=\"5184\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey open with one of their hits, “Coconut Water,” but they do a cool live remix of it that has me singing along but also grooving, like, “Damn, I hope they release this sometime,” and, “Are they the female ODESZA?” Between one of their songs, Camille Poliquin tells us that since they play their hit tracks at every show, it gets repetitive for them and so they’ve remixed versions that they now only play live. “Natalie” and “Pressure” are given equally exciting EDM-geared remixes, and they even sample an actual ODESZA song, “Boy,” in the remix of “Pressure.” “Natalie,” on the other hand, is given interjections of beats that make you dance, which turns the darker emotional aspects of the track into a carefree pop tune. If no other DJ does a remix of your songs that actually does it justice, why not just remix it yourself, right? But actually, this really showed me their versatility as a band and musicians. I’m still hoping they’ll release official versions of it sometime so I can bump it in my car and at my next kickback. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI personally knew Milk \u0026amp; Bone best from their EP \u003ci\u003eLittle Mourning\u003c/i\u003e, but this tour was off their newly released album, \u003ci\u003eDeception Bay\u003c/i\u003e. I had given it a listen when it first came out and then revisited it before the show, but in general my first impressions of the album was that their sound had changed and become more similar to other indie pop that bordered a general pop sound with effervescent female vocals, which was not as unique as the sound they boasted in \u003ci\u003eLittle Mourning\u003c/i\u003e. However, hearing these tracks live totally changed everything…which is honestly something that I love to have happen at live shows. “KIDS” was such a fun track live, with cute lyrics to go along with a bright melody that just put you in a good mood and reminded you of summer and youth. The dreamy, viscous intro to “Set in Stone” captured me immediately and the vulnerability in the lyrics kept me enraptured until the last chord. “Faded” was a darker tune with strong electronic beats that I really enjoyed, reminding me of the mood that BANKS, Kelela, or FKA Twigs give off in their music. “BBBLUE,” which was the one track that caught my ear on my solo listens before the show, was such a fun track to dance to live and definitely didn’t disappoint - a great electro-pop anthem. The Canadian duo’s live performance definitely highlighted the nuances of the non-title tracks of their new album, and gave me a newfound appreciation all of them. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThroughout the show, Poliquin would apologize for her voice because she was recovering from a cough, but honestly, I was astounded that she was sick and still sounded the way that she did. Her voice was beautiful and clear, filled with strength and emotion, and she only faltered or coughed when she was speaking. It was truly impressive, and I wonder what she sounds like when her voice is in full power. Especially at the end of “New York,” she just vocalizes a haunting cry, and it was completely flawless and bone chilling. That entire song gave me chills live. The discord in the harmony the two create when they repeat the line “I/made love/to another one,” kept me spellbound throughout. So much talent, not only vocally, but with their electronic production skills too! \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/495d93281fcd330c744917679b84b8f8/tumblr_inline_p7lwp2m3461qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, this show exceeded my expectations and grew my appreciation for Milk \u0026amp; Bone as an artist and \u003ci\u003eDeception Bay\u003c/i\u003e as an album. I’d highly recommend seeing them live if you ever get the chance! \u003c/p\u003e",

Wu, who attended Harvard University and worked at a corporate job post graduation, eventually took the leap to pursue music full time. He will be making his EDC Las Vegas debut\u003cbr/\u003ethis upcoming May.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eIs there anything you would want to say to your college self?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s really hard for me to regret any of the decisions that I made because I’ve been incredibly lucky. Growing up as a young Asian boy, being a musician’s not like a thing. That’s not an option, it’s not even in the realm of possibility, right? I’ve loved music growing up and I’ve been writing songs since I was in middle school and so it was something I loved doing, but it was like, “Alright well, now you’ve gotta get a real job and go to school.” I’ve been very lucky but finally\u003cbr/\u003emaking the leap and being like, “You know who knows what’s going to happen but I gotta give this a shot and if I don’t I’ll never forgive myself.” I had that realization relatively later on in my life but once you go for it, you kind of realize like, “Oh, the world isn’t going to end. You can figure it out, you can make things happen for yourself.” So honestly, it might sound cheesy but you know man, you’re young, go for it. Honestly it’s worth it to give it a shot. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAnd for your timeline of events, do you think you had to go through the three years of working at a corporate job for you to realize that this is what you wanted to do? Do you ever wish you found EDM earlier?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI mean literally everyday I see a new eighteen year old headlining Tomorrowland and I’m like, “God.” I will say the one thing it makes me know for sure is that any time I have a bad day or I’m stressed out, or I’m like “Why am i doing this?” I already know what the other option is, right? I already tried to have a normal life and sit at a desk and I know the worst day I have making music is better than the best day I had at that job. So for me it’s like a constant reminder of like,\u003cbr/\u003e“Oh no you gotta make this work.” It’s like, “Alright well you’re jumping off without a parachute and you better start flapping your wings because you’re not going back.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSo if you were to ever change something in the past it would basically change who you are as a person today?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYeah I think it’s like a slippery slope to go down, right? Because I really like my life and I’m very thankful and fortunate for what I get to do. But at the same time, you can’t help but think like, “Hey, maybe if I went to music school I’d be hanging out with Martin Garrix right now.” In music you draw on your life experience, right? And it’s all part of what I do but I will say that for anyone who’s thinking about stuff like that or scared to try something new: you can do it. The fear of\u003cbr/\u003edoing it is often greater than the actual challenges that you end up facing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHave you ever cried to your own song?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’ve cried because I’ve spent so long on it. When I work on a song I’ve listened to it so many times that you become numb to it, right? It’s like if you say the same word over and over again it kind of loses its meaning in your head. So when you listen to the same eight bars for literally a thousand times in a row it’s really hard to examine it as a first time listener. I look at songs when they’re done very differently than someone listening to it for the first time. And for a long time, every time I’d be done with a song it was when I hated it so much that I couldn’t work on it anymore. So it took me a long time for my first EP. I think it happened like, two or three months ago when I finally sat down and listened through the whole thing and I was like, “Okay this is pretty good.” There are things that I would still change and there are things where I was like, “Ugh, I can’t believe that made it through.” In general, I kind of forgot that nitty gritty of like, “Should the snares be like this?” where I would literally go back and forth like a hundred times and then forget what the whole point of it was in the first place. So going back and just being able to take it in as a whole piece of art, I was like “Okay, this is pretty good.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDo you ever get nervous performing?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s funny, you should ask because I was just telling my friends that I literally had like a panic attack halfway through my set. It was short and I was like, “It’s going to be okay,” but it definitely comes and goes. I mean I’ve played so many shows at this point but there’s always that fear that you’re gonna get up there and they’re going to hate what you do. Maybe it’s an irrational fear but it’s part of not taking anything for granted and not assuming that you’re just gonna go\u003cbr/\u003eup there and spin gold every time you’re on stage. There have been disasters before for sure so sometimes you’re just trying to get through it. I try and just like step back and try to enjoy the moment and be like, “This is really cool.” I mean I guess it’s also like I hope I don’t mess things up. Same thing when I’m releasing music it’s like, “I hope people like this.” I think it’s probably from being kind of a control freak. Because when I’m in the studio it’s like, “Okay, everything is\u003cbr/\u003eon me.” I work with other people but at the end of the day the final decisions are all mine and so it’s like same thing when I’m on stage. There’s no one else responsible for this and at the end of the day I’m the one making the final cut. Look, at the beginning of my career I put out a new remix every three weeks, so every three weeks I was making a certain remix or making a song and I would put everything I had into it. It was the best thing that I could do and I would finish\u003cbr/\u003eand I would be like, “I will never make anything better than this,” and I would release it and no one would care.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDid you know that you wanted to make music from the start or was it a passion that you cultivated over the years? Do you think passion is predestined or something you constantly have to rediscover?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo to the first part: I’ve always loved music ever since I was a kid. I took piano lessons, I was playing guitar in middle school, that was sort of the thing I loved. I recently found out that when I was a baby if I was crying or whatever my mom would put \u003ci\u003eFantasia\u003c/i\u003e on and sit me in front and by\u003cbr/\u003ethe time I was four or five I must’ve watched \u003ci\u003eFantasia \u003c/i\u003ea hundred times. Instead of watching \u003ci\u003eBlues Clues\u003c/i\u003e or whatever I was just watching \u003ci\u003eFantasia\u003c/i\u003e and I would think that would probably have something to do with it as a young boy with my brain developing and just listening to music. So, it’s always been the thing that has excited me and interested me and I wanted to learn how to make this. To the second part, I think that you’re passionate about the things that you are getting better at and the things that you excel at. That can be your passion too so I think\u003cbr/\u003eit’s a combination. I’ve been passionate about music ever since I was a kid but the way that I express myself in that music has changed. So before I was playing guitar and singing and now I’m producing music or producing EDM and then I will spend like a week learning songs on piano again. The exciting part to me is that at the end of the day when you’re making something, you’ve made something that you’ve never made before and to me there’s so much to learn about it and there’s such a world that even now I still don’t understand. I’ll listen to a song and be like, “How did they do that?” and then down the rabbit hole I go and that part of it has stayed the same.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eNot a lot of Asian Americans have made it as far as you have in the EDM industry. Is the lack of Asian representation something you have noticed or is it something that doesn’t really matter among you and your peers?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’ve found the EDM community to be very accepting of minorities and I think that’s one of the amazing things about dance music, is that it started out as outcast culture you know? So it’s very accepting and embracing of people from different walks of life and so I think there are a lot of young Asian American artists who are doing great things. In broader culture I try not to think\u003cbr/\u003eabout it too much but it is true, name one male, non-comedy, non-kung fu actor, it’s like John Cho, but that’s it. Bringing it full circle, it’s not an option to be a musician or to be an artist really and for a lot of my Asian American friends it’s the same way. From a young age it’s like okay, you’re gonna go to school and you’re going to become a doctor or a lawyer and that’s great, there’s no shame in that but I think that there are people out there where that’s not that biggest\u003cbr/\u003econtribution that they can have to society, they could be making amazing things and it doesn’t have to fit into one of those pre-prescribed sort of stereotypes of what an Asian should do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWere you parents pretty accepting when you wanted to quit your job?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy mom was extremely accepting. She knew how miserable I was and she was like, “Well you’re not going to kill yourself if you do this so that’s good.” I think they were definitely worried, they didn’t quite understand and I think it was like well, “I hope he gets through this phase and doesn’t get addicted to heroin,” and then once they saw that things were going pretty well and that I hadn’t asked therm for money in the entire first three years that I was doing it they were\u003cbr/\u003elike, “Oh I guess he can do it.” I think they still worry everyday but what are you going to do.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

The two had already worked together in multiple tracks, starting with Scott’s sophomore mixtape \u003ci\u003eDays Before Rodeo \u003c/i\u003e(2014) and freshman album \u003ci\u003eRodeo\u003c/i\u003e (2015). The combination of Scott’s sound effects with Quavo’s playful auto-tune mastery creates a solid blueprint for this album. The confidence they have established through their successes in the last few years allows for well-crafted lyrics as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThroughout the album, the two experienced rappers do not seem like a rap duo totally compatible with each other, yet they show off their unique styles in the most independent ways possible without compromising each other’s vocal formulas. The album starts off with “Modern Slavery” that parallels slavery in America hundreds of years ago with how they are enslaved to their life of luxury with that particular independence. Buddah Bless makes the track even more special by chopping some Otis Redding vocals into the production of the track. “Eye 2 Eye” continues with a feature from the spotlight rapper on \u003ci\u003eCulture II\u003c/i\u003e, the junior album of Migos, Takeoff. While Quavo handles the chorus, saying, “We see eye to eye,” to underscore that him and his crew are the only real ones to another, Scott supports it with throwing echoes and ad-libs. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTowards the middle of the album, we come across tracks like “Huncho Jack,” produced by the Canadian producer Murda Beatz who also has had his touch on Scott’s albums \u003ci\u003eRodeo\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eBirds in the Trap Sing McKnight\u003c/i\u003e, that have more startling keys to create an emotional depth, which has the touch of hip hop’s legendary producer Mike Dean. For the hit track “Dubai Shit,” featuring Migos’ Offset who went platinum with his solo track “Ric Flair Drip” by Metro Boomin’s production, Scott puts himself behind the boards and creates a track that parallels the rappers’ lavish lifestyle with the modern city. Later in “Saint Laurent Mask,” which was named Quavo’s favorite track on the album, we see Dean and Buddah Bless come together to create an instrumental track designed with synthesized reverb and the rappers’ auto-tuned vocals that acts as complimentary melody for the collection of bells, bringing a richer texture. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, Scott and Quavo bring a collective piece with \u003ci\u003eHuncho Jack, Jack Huncho\u003c/i\u003e by not only taking part in the vocals but also taking on roles as producers, as well as mastering the tracks in every aspect. They bring in familiar producers to work with so that their powerful and unique sounds can come out as their own instruments accompanying the melodies. This may not be each of the rapper’s best works compared with their previous platinum albums, however it definitely makes a name for itself and give us hope that there is more coming from these artists that we have not experienced the top level of yet. \u003c/p\u003e",

Tonight’s event brings the 18+ crowd, so the crowd is way younger than I’m used to. The line to get in looks interminable. My stomach grumbles. My partner and I decide to head towards Two Boots Pizza. I scarf down V for Vegan (artichokes, red onions, shiitake mushrooms, sweet red pepper pesto, basil pesto, and non-dairy cheese) and Night Stripper (sun-dried tomatoes and roasted garlic and jalapeño pesto) slices and lap up the sauce left on my fingers. Stuffed and satisfied, the bouncer places a camo wristband on my wrist. I wonder if it\u0026rsquo;s purposeful. Does it symbolize JPEGMAFIA’s time in the military? Or is it simply what the Echo has on hand?

She’s clad in sheer tights, red velvet ankle boots, an embroidered kimono, black velvet high-waisted shorts, and a corset adorned with random neon letters.

Jain grew up in Rochester, New York which established his framework for music. His mother played \u003ci\u003eBhajans\u003c/i\u003e (in Hindu this means “sharing”), known for their spiritual ideas and melodic \u003ci\u003eragas\u003c/i\u003e (melodic structures for improvisation in Indian music). Sunny’s father constantly banged his Indian banjo and harmonium to classic Bollywood music. His Jainism background was also combined with the Western influence of his sibling’s love for progressive-rock, pop, and hip-hop.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt age 4, Sunny began learning North Indian percussion and rhythm. Sunny played the Indian tabla, but at age 12 he began learning the vocabulary of jazz through idols like Max Roach and Philly Joe Jones. Growing up, Sunny\u0026rsquo;s teachers encouraged him to drop his Punjabi background and focus on American music theory. Nonetheless, when he began to compose his own music, he knew he wanted to celebrate the inclusivity of his musical backgrounds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2005, Sunny brought his culturally encompassing music to the surface at his own….wedding. He melded North Indian rhythm Bhangra with jazz, rock, hip-hop, and funk along with 30 of his talented musician friends. They performed for Sunny’s \u003ci\u003ebaraat\u003c/i\u003e. In India and Pakistan, a baraat is a massive marching procession of the groom’s wedding party before they reach the wedding venue. It is a joyous celebration of brass music, singing, stomping, and hand-clapping that can last for 5 hours.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2010, Sunny wanted to spread South Asian wedding celebrations to the masses and thus, Red Baraat was born (his mustache, however, was born in 2012). The band name came to fruition because to Sunny, red is a symbol of love, energy, and revolution. They have inspired conservative elderly in walkers in Pennsylvania to get up and dance. Furthermore, they have split their audiences in halves for epic dance battles. The band has cited inspirations from Primus, Miles Davis, Flying Lotus, Gogol Bordello, and Gurdas Maan. NPR has asked Red Baraat to perform for their Tiny Desk Concert series twice and has dubbed them “the best party band in years.” Red Baraat has performed for Obama at the White House, Bonnaroo, the Paraolympics in London, globalFEST, and an exorbitant amount of South Asian weddings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the Satellite, Red Baraat begins with chaal rhythm in “Punjabi Wedding Song (Balle Balle)” off of \u003ci\u003eChaal Baby\u003c/i\u003e. The band’s sonic palate is bewitching. The 50-pound gold sousaphone Kenneth Bentley is breathing life and bass into is enchanting. The gigantic sousaphone looks as if it could be its own satellite, its vibrations orbiting the atmosphere of the stage. Unlike Desiigner in his song Panda, Sunny is yelling his version of “\u003ci\u003errrrRRAAA\u003c/i\u003e” that I find loveable. Full of passion, Sunny freely parades on the stage with a \u003ci\u003edhol\u003c/i\u003e strapped on his shoulder, decorated by white rope and a plethora of black tassels. I have never been privy to a \u003ci\u003edhol\u003c/i\u003e and my initiation to it is mind-blowing. On the double-headed drum, Sunny crafts a tight stampeding pulsation with two uniquely curved sticks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn June 29th, Red Baraat released their latest album, Sound the People, influenced by the South Asian diaspora. Recorded at Studio G in Brooklyn, New York, the album is Red Baraat’s battle cry \u0026ndash; written weeks after Trump’s inauguration. The patient percussion of “Ghadar Machao” produces goosebumps on my arms. Derived from Arabic, Ghadar means “revolution.” I feel as if I’m at a protest, ready and determined to line-up and congregate. My arms vigorously fist pump to Sonny Singh’s beckoning voice as he sings in Punjabi, to English, and even in Spanish. Red Baraat’s candor on the political climate invigorates the crowd to joyously mourn and mindfully release anger. “Ghadar Machao” is a superb folk anthem of immigrant solidarity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\" style=\"\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e0ccb384e25a4b13671c970835b4580/tumblr_inline_pc2zrmXfSV1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4000\" data-orig-width=\"6000\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eTears flow down my cheek, but I wipe them away as the dynamic beginning of “Hey Jamalo” off of Sound the People begins. Its cadence is trance-inducing and forces every single person in the room to dance. Hips are surging, feet are stomping, arms are flailing, and there’s headbanging everywhere. The blending of Sonny Singh’s trumpet and Jonathon Haffner’s soprano saxophone is consuming alongside Chris Eddleton’s explosive drumming. The elements of North Indian Bhangra, New Orleans brass, and ska-punk in “Hey Jamalo” obliterates every box Sunny was advised to conform to as a young musician.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRays of electric blue light gleams on Jonathan Goldberger during his psychedelic rock guitar shredding on “Moray Gari Suno” off of \u003ci\u003eSound the People\u003c/i\u003e. The track is an homage to 1960’s Chutney music from Trinidad with flavors of Indian and Caribbean music. The charismatic synergy and variety of Sunny, Sonny, Jonathan, Kenneth, Jonathon, and Chris’ personalities permeate the raw energy of Red Baraat. Their individual expertise as a cohesive unit cultivates the visceral sonic textures and booming improvisations of their stellar performance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRed Baraat falls silent and Sunny invites two personalities from the crowd for a dance-battle on stage. The dancers in the center front shy away to the corners, but a courageous fan in a green shirt gets on stage. A minute or two passes and worry falls on Sunny’s face. In that sliver of a moment, I knew it was time for me to put down my notebook and jump into battle. My pulse raced as I stared into the many eyeballs shooting at me from down below.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI closed my eyes and breathed into the present moment, “\u003ci\u003eIt’s a Friday night with no homework, work, responsibilities, and worries. You’re on stage with Red Baraat. You. Got. This.\u003c/i\u003e” I opened my eyes to all my best friends, partner, and the crowd cheering me on. In a flash, the raucous of “Shruggy Ji” embroiders itself into my veins and overtakes the entirety of my ligaments. I stare into my opponent’s eyes and we both laugh. The members of Red Baraat are smiling and parading around the stage. Accompanied by their presence on stage, I feel as if I’m floating and in a utopian dimension of ecstasy and triumph.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3664\" data-orig-width=\"4030\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/33789e09b2049f6ff39129d0567f3cd0/tumblr_inline_pc2zp25BzO1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3664\" data-orig-width=\"4030\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePam Gwen, a dancing queen, with Red Baraat\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs I disembark on stage and reenergize, Red Baraat is instantly revitalized and to the next song. Sunny powerfully grabs the mic and announces, “Now this next track is Punjabi bluegrass. The original track is “Gora Mukra” meaning “fair-skinned face”, but we’ve inverted it to “Kala Mukra” meaning “dark-skinned face.” It is an act of defiance against glamorizations of white skin, subjecting women’s potential to only marriage, and a bunch of other shit like that. Let’s party.” “\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIngrained with a colonial mentality growing up, I was adamant about scrubbing my brown skin off with papaya soap to achieve the fair-skin my Filipino culture idolized. In the past year, I have found that locating myself in my Filipinx heritage has helped me formulate who I can become. “Kala Mukra” is my hymn of postcolonial consciousness. Within each measure, I feel an inner emotional and spiritual catharsis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Kala Mukra” features Ali Sethi and is murderous and frenetic. The track’s preamble is Sonny, Jonathon, and Kenneth’s feverish trumpets, the heartbeat is Chris and Sunny’s frantic percussion, and Jonathan’s spiraling Afro-Carribean groove riff is the comedown.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs I look around the variety of beautiful skin colors around me, I find healing. As the bridge of “Apna Punjab Hove” begins, my friend, who hasn’t been dancing much tonight, begins tearing up the dance floor. My friends and I know that he is a professional Indian wedding dancer and we go berserk \u0026ndash; we’ve never seen him dance in the flesh before. As we circle around him, a woman in a kurti and another in a blue pin-up dress begin doing classical Indian dance moves. To their left, two men pair up and do Bhangra, a Punjabi-style dance. From beginning to end, Red Baraat puts its crowd into a loving trance, lulling us into hedonistic dancing for what seems like an eternity. Their infectious and magnetizing energy is an experience in itself. A sense of world peace is exposure to Red Baraat’s revolutionary and humanitarian virtuosity.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FX9fZspZ1sT8\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X9fZspZ1sT8?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

To make matters worse, this was the second time that week that they were robbed, just after re-buying new gear and continuing on the road again. While unfortunate it is to lose almost everything that they were traveling with, to add to the circumstance is the fact that they still had multiple shows lined up. Two of which were set in two days time at The Echo. As heartbroken as fans would be to hear a show cancellation, most would understand given the position that Preoccupations was put in, a position generating a far more broken heart and deflated spirit in the band themselves. However, as dismal as that week was, it didn’t disfigure their character nor detain them from performing two lively sold-out shows at The Echo and whatever came after. No matter how defeating they may have felt internally, they didn’t allow it to take over their persona or work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2592\" data-orig-height=\"1728\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/88d5fcd8b8415a61db4f43e9b9d5703f/tumblr_inline_p9maswc0Qb1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2592\" data-orig-height=\"1728\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009On tour for their latest record, \u003ci\u003eNew Material\u003c/i\u003e, Preoccupations took the stage at The Echo calmly and rather uneventfully. As a group of somewhat middle-aged men who just had all their tour belongings stolen, you could read the past couple of days in their eyes. They started off the set with “Select Your Drone”, slow and steady, but as the song progressed so did they. At least to the onlookers, it was evident how transformative and meditative this night was aligned to become for Preoccupations. They demanded a release and this was going to be it for them. As is, their music already is blissfully and aggressively cathartic, and that night it was more medicinal than ever. Preoccupations are known for their sexy dark post-punk sound, which easily radiated throughout the space everyone was in, almost constructing this consuming tunnel vision mystique over the band.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2592\" data-orig-height=\"1728\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aff9c64bedf8523269e06ac99febb804/tumblr_inline_p9matfwGyc1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2592\" data-orig-height=\"1728\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009It was relatively obvious how fatigued they all were, quite often breaking for beer followed by water, as any responsible adult would. However, their ability to push through and still perform at such a taxing level was commendable. They were as engaged as ever not only with themselves but the music as well. Although on tour for \u003ci\u003eNew Material\u003c/i\u003e they only played “Disarray” and “Decompose”, with most of the set coming from the Preoccupations and Viet Cong records, which produced the most chaos out of the crowd. “Death” in particular, their closing song, brought together the entire venue together in a rigorous entranced episode no matter how divided the older and younger crowds were. Even the frontman of Moaning got himself mixed up in the pit during the repetitive portal portions of it. For the first time in the night, some of the crowd closed their eyes along with the band to also enter the meditative dream daze trance as one, soon to emerge as slightly more level versions of themselves. By the end of the night, everyone in that room that shared that experience felt a little bit lighter, a little bit more whole, and a little bit more connected, all of which could never have been achieved without the metamorphic abilities of Preoccupations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1173\" data-orig-height=\"1546\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0f30439a5a63e5d03d8d8599ada980d4/tumblr_inline_p9matwFePG1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1173\" data-orig-height=\"1546\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eIf you would like to donate to their cause you can use this link: \u003ca href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/preoccupationsgearfund\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://www.gofundme.com/preoccupationsgearfund\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Remnants of a vintage projection theater meant that there were scaffolded theater seats in the back third of the room for those that wanted to relax with a drink and soak in the show, but the option to stand and sway softly to the guitar and see Vagabon’s expressive facials up close was available as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough her stature is short and her frame small, Vagabon holds the center of the stage with a strong and solid stance, guitar firmly in hand. The band starts off with her more rock-heavy songs like “Cold Apartment” and “Minneapolis”, which are backed by her bassist and drummer and build up to powerful chords that convey the emotions behind the simple and raw lyrics. Most of the songs on her LP, \u003ci\u003eInfinite Worlds\u003c/i\u003e, are characterized by these extremely personal and poetic but sparse lyrics that span from talking about her identity, to being short, calling herself a “small fish” on “The Embers.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3456\" data-orig-height=\"5184\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a5d59bc09d38959041ae5c1030fdcce8/tumblr_inline_p98xldOezo1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3456\" data-orig-height=\"5184\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen she starts to transition into the softer, acoustic songs, she commands the stage with warm, full-bodied voice, which holds a stark contrast to her talking voice. When she talks to the audience, she sounds like a familiar friend, a voice and inflection we’re all used to hearing. But once she starts to sing, there is a new shape to her voice \u0026ndash; she opens her mouth wide to allow for more resonance and a huskier but fuller sound emerges to match the rawness of the songs she composes, really embodying her inner punk spirit. “Fear \u0026amp; Force” has me swaying along to the soft acoustic arpeggios of her guitar, while during “The Embers,” the audience shyly sings along to the refrain, “You’re a shark that hates everything,” until she encourages us to join us in the loud and free ending of the song.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dd708c2e5cf4f236ac97946f917560e3/tumblr_inline_p98xoi0Bl31qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eVagabon is a talented instrumentalist, lyricist, producer, and vocalist whose work ranges from bright punk to electronic refrains and emotional ballads.

Where did you grow up? What was growing up in that city like?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI grew up in California close to LA. To be honest once I found music I never really went outside. Before that I was just playing video games and watching cartoons. I guess the internet was more of where I grew up, as opposed to any geographical place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat music did you listen to a lot growing up? What were your favorite artists back in like middle school, for example? \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn middle school it was John Frusciante, all day everyday. Something about his guitar playing really inspired me. It was soulful and beautiful and just felt perfect, like every note was exactly where it should be. In high school my music taste exploded, but John Frusciante was the majority of the first music I learned and played.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eTell us a little about how City Girl first got started.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI uploaded \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/citygrl/on-the-train-somewhere-between-my-apartment-and-you\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eon the train somewhere between my apartment and you\u003c/a\u003e 10 months ago on Soundcloud and just emailed a bunch of Youtube channels that were taking submissions. Aurarian music accepted that first release and put it out on Youtube and got the ball rolling so City Girl could get some attention back when it was only 10-20 followers. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow did you come up with the name City Girl?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo be honest, its in honor of “City Girl” by Kevin Shields from the \u003ci\u003eLost In Translation\u003c/i\u003e soundtrack. I’m a huge My Bloody Valentine fan and that song of his is just so amazing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhen did you first start making music? How did you get into it, and how did you first learn how to produce a beat? \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI got into guitar playing when I was 12 or so. I just played because my older brother had a guitar. I took it and just Googled how to play guitar and taught myself songs and chords. It was the most fun I’d ever had. It felt so special. I didn’t start producing for like another seven years though. I would just record onto a Tascam tape recorder and jam with friends in garages. I had friends who made lofi beats waay back when it was like CULP and Simo and Onra and john wayne and stuff, but I never got into it, I was more focused on improvising and expanding my musical repertoire in a more performance-focused way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAre there any instruments that you would like to try out incorporating into your music that you haven\u0026rsquo;t tried yet?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI want live drums but I live in an apartment. If I could record drums that would be so cool, since I play drums too and I miss it badly. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhere do you usually record your music? Describe your studio space to us.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s about five feet no joke from my bed haha. It’s a desk and a midi keyboard and some guitars and other little instruments like the melodica. I have speakers and an old mic. It’s super cozy, my bedroom at my apartment is just covered with \u003ca href=\"https://www.twitter.com/vickisigh\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evickisigh\u003c/a\u003e’s art, like everywhere you look it’s just cute sexy ladies in pastel colors, I love it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1516\" data-orig-height=\"417\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dca65db8b6d9bbc620268379a8ab652d/tumblr_inline_p8ovm7zsBp1qhakxc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1516\" data-orig-height=\"417\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003evickisigh’s (Vicki Tsai) artwork, from her \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/vickisigh\" target=\"_blank\"\u003einstagram\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow would you describe the lo-fi/chillhop genre and subculture to someone who’s never been exposed to it?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s just a bunch of people who love making music on their computers, and to be honest only one percent is unique and actually worth your time, but the same goes for all genres, 99 percent of it is just not that good. I would be more specific but at this point lofi stands for so so much that you can’t really go much further than that. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat do you think of the lo-fi hip hop/chillhop genre in general? It\u0026rsquo;s really popular right now what with the \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohQPySWJToo\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube 24hr lo-fi hip hop studying beats\u003c/a\u003e stream and the\u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/user/chillhopmusic/playlist/74sUjcvpGfdOvCHvgzNEDO?si=QqyarcrpS6avBNfPiIi3Fw\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Spotify lo-fi hip hop studying beats\u003c/a\u003e playlists as well\u0026hellip; There\u0026rsquo;s literally probably thousands of really similar chillhop producers on SoundCloud\u0026hellip; does that ever make you feel swallowed up, in a sense? Or does it feel more like a really large community? How do you try to stand out as an artist among all these other producers? \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s a tough question to answer, because you can go from \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/quicklyquickly\" target=\"_blank\"\u003equickly, quickly\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/in-love-with-a-ghost\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ein love with a ghost\u003c/a\u003e and still call it lofi if you want to. These artists share playlists together and Youtube mixes. Who’s to say quickly, quickly isn’t just jazz? Who’s to say in love with a ghost isn’t just electronic music? It’s not so much a genre as it is a movement of instrumental music becoming the focus itself rather than the singer/rapper. Staying unique seems simple to me as I grew up playing and learning music by ear, so I just follow my interests/inspiration and play whatever seems cool.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhich artists would you say are your biggest inspirations or that you\u0026rsquo;re just blown away by and really admire within your genre? How about outside of your genre?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWell in love with a ghost stands out, like most peeps I found them on Youtube.

Just super cool textures and melodies, really lovely and creative music. \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/kuplasound\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKupla\u003c/a\u003e is amazing too, he’s an amazing piano player, all of his music is great. Outside of my genre I’d say Sheena Ringo, especially her album \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalk_Samen_Kuri_no_Hana\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003ci\u003eKalk Samen Kuri no Hana\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e - it’s pretty much game over, this album does everything better in every regard imaginable than any other music I’ve heard. Don’t know if you can get access to it in US tho, the copyright lawyers are hard at work on this one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat artist outside of the lo-fi hip hop genre would you really really love to collaborate with? Can you describe the kind of track you\u0026rsquo;d want to make with them?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith anyone, well shit Beyoncé right? I mean she’s the best vocalist alive next to Frank Ocean. I would just want to make something really beautiful, some \u003ci\u003eIn Rainbows\u003c/i\u003e type stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eBeing an artist based out of Bandcamp/Soundcloud in this day means a lot of your career is kind of born out of the internet. What are your favorite and least favorite parts about the internet and spending so much time on the internet/interacting with people on the internet/sharing yourself through the internet? \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI love the internet because I can share whatever I want when I want. I don’t feel a lot of pressure because I don’t have any personal accounts on social media and never have, I always just read a lot of books and listened to records and stuff. I’m sure some people think it’s mysterious or whatever that I never cared for social media, instead opting to just read Sartre or watch old movies, but nowadays all I do is make music and play Skyrim so it’s all good. The internet gives me access to all that goodness so I can find it offline.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat are your top five favorite artists right now?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTom Misch, Swell, quickly quickly, in love with a ghost, and Sam Gellaitry\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat are your top five favorite female artists?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSheena Ringo, Beyoncé, \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/waltzforluma\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAivi Tran\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=miso\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMISO\u003c/a\u003e (from club eskimo - a collective including \u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/6aLdhHUqgdKE86xbtNmY8g?si=L-y4Gu54Qtq6OOW6SCZKGQ\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCrush\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/3eCd0TZrBPm2n9cDG6yWfF?si=hvcx5FzEQLa6GaED91RgJw\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDean\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/0dTj3SqwE8kPnCzyzvYzhT?si=rFBBBq7dTrKbl8_JTAbUBA\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eoffonoff\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/4cMtnnGdRvh8KIi2RA7ZeU?si=fusMPR8ZRYOakMea6D7scw\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e2xxx!\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/3fHPyTsMe9svn7cz1MWbfx?si=UTT1_MRERkCrAfHaOw8csw\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emillic\u003c/a\u003e, and more), and \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/imtiffany\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etiffi\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDo you have a favorite spot in LA that you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to share with anyone else? \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWherever YAYAYI and JALENTUNA happen to be any given saturday night in k-town is a pretty special vibe that honestly can’t be shared even if I wanted it to be. God there was this $5 flat pho place on Western Ave. that was run by this old couple but it closed like 5 years ago, that was the best place ever and it straight up was ALWAYS empty, no one ate there. I think it was like Pho 36 haha one of those LA pho places that has a random number after it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat are some things that you really enjoy doing for yourself? When you need to take a day for yourself, what are things that you\u0026rsquo;ll usually do?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSkyrim is a go-to. It’s usually video games but a lot of times it’s just making music. You gotta understand music is like an addiction to me. I never stop thinking about sounds and I feel uneasy not making music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSo we know you like video games… what are some of your favorite video games of all time? Do you have any funny anecdotes from playing games online with strangers?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFavorite of all time is Psychonauts. Such a creative game and Scott Campbell’s art is the absolute bee’s knees. Right now my favorite is Skyrim as mentioned. I love RPG and adventure games, the immersion gets me good. I loved games growing up, played anything. I have a lot of anecdotes about gaming but I honestly can’t think of just one. Haha well when Xbox Live came out online gaming was brand new and I remember my dad getting on the headset asking people not to cuss (since I was just a kid) and THEY STOPPED. They were like “Oh sorry dude we didn’t know there were kids playing we will keep the cursing to a minimum.” Can you imagine that nowadays? It would never happen. That shit still blows my mind. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDo you play Fortnite? If so, what are your thoughts on it?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI played Fortnite with Chance, thrash, and Maru the other night and I hate it so much lol. The vibe is so terrible, the aesthetic makes me want to barf it’s so ugly. That was the only time I’ve really played it and it hasn’t been on my mind, the itch isn’t there so I guess no hype for me. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat are your favorite K-Pop bands or members?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSNSD was the OG.

He is a very handsome and beautiful man. He is a shadow in the night. Every part of him is gray except his lil tongue which is pink and his eyes which are green. He lives at my parents house so I don’t see him except at holidays, but he is my good soft boy. I think of him very often. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"839\" data-orig-height=\"820\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d402d5cab84ffc5978bf03b16c2cef0d/tumblr_inline_p8ovmxndra1qhakxc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"839\" data-orig-height=\"820\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eart from Snow Rose, by vickisigh\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat would you say is your favorite track that you\u0026rsquo;ve produced? \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/1naqrWNoxyi6PEXz3NOXW0?si=_FOqzaRbQemLC2PydU8CeA\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e“Anything Like Her”\u003c/a\u003e with tiffi is prob my fav.

The second half with the acoustic and electric guitar just feels really special. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat was your inspiration for \u003ci\u003eTime Falls Like Moonlight\u003c/i\u003e?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI make so much music, the inspiration doesn’t really ever make sense, I am inspired by everything in each moment, I am inspired by my own passion to make music. Not understanding what is going on is really important to how I work, it makes things exciting. I just want the music to make people feel loved and understood for who they are, that there is a purpose for them, a life they can live and be loved in. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhen you make songs, are they ever about specific things, people, or events in your life?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot really, it’s just all my emotions sort of bleeding into the computer. I don’t know if I could write about any particular thing, but I do enjoy imagining lots of people and situations to my music after I made it. Like oh this sounds like Moonlight Hill (from Kingdom Hearts) or this sounds like a tender look from someone or this sounds like a lonely plaza in the middle of some city. It’s all free and open to interpretation. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/4Upt2O9SCYCVEqgsuzY71b?si=IZ7BXU68RqGXW-8kt4vl8g\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e“Winter Fields”\u003c/a\u003e is one of my favorite tracks of yours\u0026hellip; mostly because of the lovely violin part by mklachu. It\u0026rsquo;s so dreamy and kind of reminds me of some of my favorite Ryuichi Sakamoto pieces, too. Can you tell us a little about this track?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s random but the track started as a like, flex? I was watching Joji’s Youtube aliases and god they are just awful I mean like him fucking with people and being super lewd and nasty I hate it but I was watching it anyway to like fry my brain and I thought it would be fun to make a nasty trap beat that would fit with his videos and I made “Winter Fields” (I know it doesn’t make sense at all). The song slowly got more romantic as I added piano layers the next day and then \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/mklachu\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emklachu\u003c/a\u003e tweeted at me out of nowhere and I asked her to play over it and yeah it’s just what happens when you work on music all the time, everything going on makes it into the song. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAnother one of my favorites is “Chateau Fountain.” I love the slow buildup, and then the talking portion that kind of just emerges and goes into like an acoustic drop\u0026hellip; ahhhh.. I was wondering where that talking portion is from actually. The guy is like, \u0026ldquo;Take the flowers,\u0026rdquo; and the girl is like \u0026ldquo;I’m all right!\u0026rdquo; and it sounds like an uncomfortable struggle\u0026hellip;a common pattern in society where\u0026hellip; men force women to do things regardless of their autonomy or feelings (ha ha). Does it have any significance to the meaning behind the track? What were your reasons for choosing to put that particular snippet in this track? It\u0026rsquo;s interesting because for me, I think I\u0026rsquo;m more sensitive than the average person to these kind of power dynamics or like\u0026hellip;oppression against women in all aspects of daily interactions or media that I consume, so when I listen to this track it\u0026rsquo;s like a soft buildup to this point of conflict that is kind of grating, but then evolves back into a calming acoustic melody. That\u0026rsquo;s personal, of course, but it\u0026rsquo;s interesting. \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDUDE YOU HAVEN’T SEEN \u003ci\u003eATONEMENT\u003c/i\u003e? Omg that movie is so incredible. It’s James McAvoy talking to Kiera Knightley and they have all this tension because they love each other but they can’t be together and ooooooooooooooooooh it’s so good. Their love is so beautiful and honest but it’s injected with all this tension and conflict from society and politics.

Yes, art pop requires a bit of digging and some persistence, but it doesn’t require anyone to be intimately acquainted with the topics of exploration that often preoccupy its composition. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlenty of artists who can be classified by this label take liberties within their music to consider broad subjects, often relating to the reality of human existence. But this form, uniquely unlimited by norms or expectations, is able to push past traditional understandings of what a piece of music should or can be and delves deeply into philosophical experiments in thought and art, all without pushing listeners too far away. Artists like Perfume Genius sometimes discuss less abstract topics, like adulthood, but in equally artful manners to artists with broader more, enigmatic concerns. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile it can be disconcerting and even distressing to hit play on a track that forces interaction between a listener and a weighty topic, the genre has incredible flexibility and power to involve its listeners in its project. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUp until very recently, over the course of the last year or so, my opinion has changed on the value of art pop. Initially, I shied away from music that might force me into a deep existential crisis, spinning out from the mention of  my mortality or human failure, but now I welcome the opportunity to splash around in topics that often require a deep dive, so deep in fact, it feels unlikely that it would be possible to resurface.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOr maybe, as I’ve immersed myself into a bastion of academia, elite condescension and inaccessibility, I’ve simply come closer to valuing that which art pop represents and upholds. But what’s important for the purpose of this article is not whether I have become a star member of the dreaded class of academic elite, but rather how I came to respect, love and explore this self-contradictory genre of music. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI came into this new understanding through the prolific work of Jenny Hval, and her 2016 album \u003ci\u003eBlood Bitch.\u003c/i\u003e An album supposedly about vampires, as Hval states in the beginning moments of the track “The Great Undressing,” to which someone replies, “That’s so basic,” as the first lyrics come into the scene, “Late capitalism, it looks like unrequited love.” But really, the album is all about periods - no, not the punctuation marks. Vampires for Hval are a symbol for women, and display a continuation of her album’s long fixation with the female body and menstruation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e In the same vein as many albums within the genre, \u003ci\u003eBlood Bitch\u003c/i\u003e on first listen feels surreal, and above my intellectual capabilities, but with repetition and concentration I soon came to love the album and regard the principle track, “Conceptual Romance,” as a favorite. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis high regard for the Norwegian artist meant I was ecstatic to hear news of a recent release. The single “Spells,” released on April 11, is the first hint of an album to come entitled \u003ci\u003eThe Long Sleep. \u003c/i\u003ePresumably, this album will tackle a similarly complex human issue: death. But for an album, and more specifically a single, about such a seemingly bleak topic, the music is pleasantly upbeat. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith lyrics like, “You are your own disco ball/Hovering above you like a comforting reminder/That not even you belong to you,” the song leaps into a lighter, optimistic view of mortality. Everything about the music is an open invitation for the consideration of something generally regarded as dark and dreary. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e The piano is uplifting at the beginning, mixed into overwhelmingly jazzy tones with a saxophone that continues pulling you up into the music and preparing you for what’s to come. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA steady drum beat joins in with a pop-ish feel, forcing you to bop your head along. Then, the song hits its peak and Hval’s characteristic speak-singing soft voice with a high-pitch comes in to replace the saxophone and follow the piano keys. Something about it feels like an 80’s cocktail bar, but it’s a marked departure from the solemn, nearly angsty vibes that Hval generally unleashes in her music. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHer continual high pitched holds give the song a light, young feel despite the harshness of the lyrics “you will not be awake for long,” before coming to its conclusion with some light scatting - only furthering the jazz references. Her voice speaks softly in the last few lines of the song as the music fades and the saxophone returns to complete the song full-circle. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHval has impressed yet again and pushed the edges of her style, attempting something new and wholly successful with “Spells.”\u003c/p\u003e",

An exuberant cult following was en route to envelope the theater anticipating one of the most stimulating, thrilling lineups The Regent has encountered in a while.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“That’s right kids, plaid suits are back,” affirmed Shattered Faith’s frontman Spencer Bartsch to the crowd far below his years. The night commenced with a first wave So-Cal punk gem, whose drummer also happened to be The Garden twins’ dad, Steve Shears. The younger crowd seemed to thoroughly enjoy their presence and admire their obvious experience even though this was probably their first time hearing them. They performed their notable songs like “I Love America,” “Another Day Passes,” and “Rise \u0026amp; Fall”, generating a mosh pit for most of them. Despite their somewhat lacking in popularity during their prime and inconsistent frequency in the scene, their dark, gritty, melodic, and genuine sound proved eminent that night.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2592\" data-orig-height=\"1728\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3748848c24c217e7d2693699836ae6a2/tumblr_inline_p790qaZirO1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2592\" data-orig-height=\"1728\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eSoon after Cowgirl Clue, formerly known as Wu-Wu, took the stage. Ashley Calhoun never steps on a stage without mesmerizing the audience with not only her carefully constructed songs, but also her dynamic fit. This time she decided that a pair of cherry red go-go boots and a matching patent leather coat would suit the night well. The crowd immediately took to her as she has been a regular with The Garden as of late, not that that has had any effect on how the crowd perceives her. Her music stands for itself and anyone that comes in contact with it can realize its worth and the magic spun within. Her dreamy vibrating persona and electric bubble-gum 90s sound mixed with a lick of gentle dark pop filled the crowd with a warm tingly sensation only she can provide. “Cherry Jubilee” and “Limelite” seemed to strike a considerably inspired and exciting note within the audience as they bounced around in dance. Nothing compares to Calhoun’s own refined and charming dance moves though, completing the unconditional ethereal ambiance that seeps out of her pores.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2592\" data-orig-height=\"1728\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bd042bd59e1932e29255df1cc09ecc3d/tumblr_inline_p7912oxmcc1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2592\" data-orig-height=\"1728\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eFollowing Cowgirl Clue, the classic Tijuana Panthers took the stage. The delicacy lingering in the air was soon replaced by a volatile blast driven by the garage surf rock Tijuana Panthers are known so well for. While the entire set was full of high energy, not only from the performers but also the onlooking crowd, “Creature of The Night” shook the theater in a certain elevated way. Not even the most distracted of fans in that moment could admit that the time-honored bass line didn’t jolt them out of their stream of consciousness. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2592\" data-orig-height=\"1728\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8a0b0b4e85f9302f41f0f15a33a68084/tumblr_inline_p7914gCJbp1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2592\" data-orig-height=\"1728\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe night soon began to draw to a close as the final and most anticipated band emerged from backstage, The Garden. The crowd immediately erupted as the intricate and unique twins began their famously intense set. As soon as the phrase, “You want the scoop?” exploded from the speakers, the crowd shot back with as equal a volume, “Yeah I got it baby!” without a second’s delay. It was as if the pulsating fans had practiced day and night for weeks prior just to nail that exchange right on the head. From there on forward the crowd had officially detonated, and was sent into a chaotic frenzy. The Garden has created a name for their own eclectic universe, Vada Vada, and that night not a single person was excluded from that world. While Wyatt pounded his way across the stage and Fletcher jumped off of his drum-kit, all eyes were on them, refusing to miss even a second of their performance. While known for the quick punk roots in which they started, their set mostly consisted of newer songs off their latest records \u003ci\u003eMirror Might Steal Your Charm\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003ehaha\u003c/i\u003e. No matter what song they did play, no one was able to stand still, whether they wanted to or not. Songs like “All Smiles Over Here :)” and “Call The Dogs Out” were great examples of how even though The Garden has diverged from their roots a bit, their fans adapt and find new parts of them they never knew they even would like. Even though they chose to leave the jester-esque face paint at home, their fans didn’t care in the slightest, knowing the sporadic atmosphere they created for themselves isn’t defined by a small unusual and unique embellishment of the face. The Garden are authentic in anything they do, and seem to not be physically able to disappoint.\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2592\" data-orig-height=\"1728\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/eec856220f9e1926fb6a3729f58b3170/tumblr_inline_p7919fT3bP1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2592\" data-orig-height=\"1728\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

The trio came together to give the message that this Halloween season, bad guys will be the winners. The lead vocals, 21 Savage and Offset, may seem to be artists of different styles through their different approaches, with 21 Savage sounding almost numb with a hostile and cold-blooded delivery, and Offset with exhilarating and well-measured meters. But their differences somewhat complement each other to create this fierce album. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile 21’s verses are very uniform, concise and direct, without any change in its melodic tone, Offset adds a touch of density to the overall tone of the tracks. They open up the album with “Ghostface Killers,” an homage to Ghostface Killah, a member of the legendary hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan, to start off the album with a bold statement of why nobody should mess with them, along with Travis Scott. This is also the first time that these three rappers are involved on the same track. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe horror of the album is overly exaggerated, with the rappers as goons of a dangerous lifestyle of Ghostface Killers and Mad Stalkers. Offset makes it even more fun with the platinum track “Ric Flair Drip,” named after the WWE Hall of Famer and 16-World Champion Ric Flair, showing off his lavish and wild lifestyle. Throughout the track, Offset uses Ric Flair’s trademark shout “whoo” as an ad-lib. On the other hand, in “My Choppa Hate N****s,” 21 Savage references the violence in the streets and his personal experiences around gang wars, which adds to the horror theme of the album. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo support the rappers, Metro Boomin finds a balance in the beats, supporting the dark tone with ghostly beats and also complementing them with melodies full of adrenaline and hype. In “Rap Saved Me,” Metro Boomin manages highs and lows between Offset and 21 Savage’s verses respectively and uses the drums so powerfully in the transition that they elevate every stanza. In every beat drop, one feels the sudden attack that is approaching them. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWithout Warning\u003c/i\u003e is overall an album that never loses its intention in the Halloween theme. It seems short with only 10 tracks, but is very concise in its verses and beats to give the listeners both the high spirits and the cold shakes. The surprising collaboration that came very suddenly to our attention definitely brings the satisfaction. \u003c/p\u003e",

All the PAC 12 teams didn’t even make it to the weekend. Arizona got blown out by Buffalo, UCLA looked lost against St. Bonaventure, and Arizona State couldn’t break down Syracuse’s zone. With all this being known, the committee had looked like geniuses for leaving out USC. That was the story entering the games on Friday. Now no one will ever remember that the PAC 12 was terrible in this tournament. The biggest upset in the college basketball happened this weekend, and saved the PAC 12 from all the shame it faced.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUMBC ,being the first 16 seed to win against a 1, will forever be the story of this tournament. People will wonder how it happened: was UMBC under-seeded, was UVA overseeded? All of these questions and story lines are what will be associated with this tournament. The PAC 12’s abysmal showing will forever be overshadowed by this. This tournament, no matter who wins, who makes the Final 4, and what other Cinderella stories there are, will always be about UMBC. UMBC did the impossible. I truly believed it was impossible for a 1 to lose to a 16. It just seemed so difficult. Whenever there was a great 16 seed, they would be over-hyped,and the 1 seed would just blow them out. This year, it was different.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e A team that lost by over 40 to Albany around 2 months ago beat UVA, a team that won the ACC regular-season title and then the ACC tournament. UMBC, no matter how much further it went in this tournament, will always be the biggest winner of the opening weekend. Those players will forever be remembered in the record books. They did the impossible. The David truly beat the Goliath.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs PAC 12 looks at it though, this upset saved them from all the negative media that was on the way, as UVA has taken it off their hands. \u003c/p\u003e",

Their House x Techno watermark was etched over the three stages: The Palms (house music), City Steps (techno music) and Ocean View Stage (a variety of styles, bigger acts). An event that happens twice a year, once in Spring and once in the Fall, CRSSD’s signature ambiance draws an eclectic crowd. I have heard about the festival from several friends, who noted that the crowd is one of the best they have seen (perhaps partially due to the 21+ age restriction).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"975\" data-orig-height=\"650\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b7f4dc8e9f6baad10ae4b584cfc344ea/tumblr_inline_pg42xg4nl41qhakxc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"975\" data-orig-height=\"650\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eAtmosphere and Amenities\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerfect location in downtown San Diego, friendly and invigorating crowd, felt right at home and in my element. The Palms stage was intricately decorated with sunset-colored Kyōwagasa (Chinese oil-paper umbrellas) and, as its name suggests, glowing palms. The stage setup definitely alludes to the dub reggae, Jungle music era that dominated the early UK rave scenes, while also incorporating colors reflecting the sunset, the crowd-favorite time of the festival. How seamless the stage was to its surroundings is unparalleled; further, the sailboats that docked along the coast at sunset further enhanced the visual layers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"975\" data-orig-height=\"650\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/560171e6ef0219089d076e60c6c0662c/tumblr_inline_pg42xoFEuR1qhakxc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"975\" data-orig-height=\"650\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"975\" data-orig-height=\"650\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7bfb1b30e09071223777eb0c172db264/tumblr_inline_pg42zdUSE11qhakxc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"975\" data-orig-height=\"650\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat I also thought was interesting to note was that the CRSSD FEST app had a push notification for when selective artists started cruising into the festival through the crowd, such as the duo, Sofi Tukker’s distinctive outfit that caught the eyes of many before their set as they made their way to the stage. It goes to show CRSSD FEST’s attempts to make artists more approachable, as it creates a more interactive and unique atmosphere. I recall the duo also chose a fan to go on stage to dance with them, which brought the crowd to higher spirits.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"975\" data-orig-height=\"650\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fb3921fac9b4076eb275278a009bcf69/tumblr_inline_pg42yugw8d1qhakxc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"975\" data-orig-height=\"650\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eCrowd and Culture\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eDefinitely one of the most dedicated groups of fans attended CRSSD FEST. There were people who dressed up in shirts with pizza prints just for AntiUp’s “Pizza” song WHILE eating pizza timed right when the duo played it at the set; countless exchanges between fans counting the number of times they have seen Louis the Child live were made; fans of Dillon Nathaniel coming in as early as 12 pm right when the gates opened to catch his set … Such loyalty does not come easy, and CRSSD FEST appears to also draw the most stylish fans (not the people, but the literal fans) around.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"975\" data-orig-height=\"650\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/52c333e6b38e68eef6b43e8af074495e/tumblr_inline_pg42yaXHOZ1qhakxc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"975\" data-orig-height=\"650\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eMusic\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI had a handful of acts that I was determined to see on my schedule that I added on the CRSSD FEST app. However, the proximity of the three stages encourages you to walk around and explore between the different artists playing concurrently. My favorite vantage point was on the ledge to the water fountains, although a bit far removed from the stage itself, you would actually be able to listen to both the Palms and City Steps stages’ performances (one on your left side, one on your right), which creates very interesting orchestral crossovers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome notable acts included Darius’s live set, Méle (yes to French DJs), John Digweed (his 2-hour sunset set was the best yet, I’ve formerly seen him in a broiler room event in Fabric London but this topped that 100%), Shallou (the barefooted vocalist who jumped off stage to greet audience was an absolute crowd hype), Helena Hauff as well as headliners Duke Dumont and Nina Kraviz. However, the consensual favorite was Anti-Up, the iconic duo (shoutout to another iconic duo UCLA student attendees, Austin Berke, and Aleksandra Vojvodić) at 6:45 pm on Sunday. The reason is that since it was a debut performance, most of the audience did not have a preconceived experience or impression to gauge their expectations off of, so the entire set was a breath of fresh air with many pleasant surprises and twists. I was instantly a converted fan after the set; Chris Lake and Chris Lorenzo are definitely ones to watch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"975\" data-orig-height=\"650\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7eeb8df1307ad9fa525a68345f048645/tumblr_inline_pg42zqiikx1qhakxc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"975\" data-orig-height=\"650\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eShoutout: Oliver (unpictured)\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eA former UCLA Radio guest interviewee, Oliver (interview mix \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/deependtheory/oliver-interview-mix\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e), had an absolutely captivating set at the Palms stage. His hidden stature (shades, cap, going in and out of the leaves during his set) added a mysterious aura around him, and the more into the set it progressed, the more entrancing his music became.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eBest Visuals: Louis the Child\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn particular, the visuals accompanying one of their newest singles, “Dear Sense ft.

This is the first K-drama I have watched, and it surprised me with its ridiculous humor and giddy romance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore watching \u003ci\u003eStrong Girl Do Bong Soon,\u003c/i\u003e I dismissed K-dramas as being too soap opera like \u0026ndash; I had seen the television screens of my parents who watched Chinese dramas, and the number of tears and people dying seemed absurd. Only, I was proven wrong with how refreshing and lovable the characters were, as well as the way the show handled the responsibilities of power, specifically the pressure to use it for good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"929\" data-orig-height=\"499\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/63b588a68966ed97f107cd36aa6cdd1b/tumblr_inline_pc0yuzNKe41qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"929\" data-orig-height=\"499\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe plot: Our heroine Do Bong-soon has superhuman strength, and she becomes the bodyguard of Min-hyuk, the obnoxious CEO of esteemed video game company Ainsoft. She also works with Guk-Doo, a police officer, to solve a series of kidnapping cases. She has to juggle these two opposing conflicts in her life while working out her feelings for these two men.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe good: While I cannot deny that simply making a female main character have extreme physical strength isn’t the pinnacle of feminism, I cannot deny that I wasn’t rooting for her while she was proving herself to men who dismissed her. Bong Soon holds all of the power, from navigating crime to her romantic relationships, and I loved seeing such an undeniably strong heroine. Bong Soon is adorable, and you cannot help but fall for her the same way Min Hyuk does, which is giggling and falling to the floor in joy. She may be physically strong, but she also lives her daily life with compassion and a desire to enforce justice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMin-Hyuk is wonderfully feminine, from crying over comic books to his adoration of Bong Soon. With overly masculine depictions of men in mainstream media, I loved seeing a character the complete opposite, especially as the central love interest. He was fascinated with her confidence and forwardness \u0026ndash; he accepts her for who she is, for all of the trouble she brings, and that is a sentiment to admire. Their chemistry is squeal-inducing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"738\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3d0329ebff63fd61b4d4b883f3a6edc6/tumblr_inline_pc0yv3IOkg1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"738\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe bad: The show mocks the LGBT community \u0026ndash; not overtly, but enough for it to be an issue. Gay characters are a caricature of flamboyancy, as seen in the Team One leader. Furthermore, domestic abuse is treated lightly; Bong Soon’s mother is supposed to be a comedic character in how she mistreats everyone, but her tiger mother nature is too extreme at times. Bong Soon’s father is powerless to her abuse.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the show progresses, unnecessary side stories pop up and detract from all of the good of the series with how much screen time they take up. The real charm of this show is the changing relationship between the main characters \u0026ndash; these minor characters simply cannot attract the same attention.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGoing along with my expectations of K-dramas, the sheer cheesiness and overdramatization are too much at times. I had to continually suspend my disbelief at how things occurred simply to further than the plot but made no sense in the grand scheme.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a whole, \u003ci\u003eStrong Girl Do Bong Soon\u003c/i\u003e is a delightful yet occasionally problematic K-drama that I would recommend watching. While certain issues cannot be ignored, this rom-com deserves the praise it has been getting.\u003c/p\u003e",

The Warriors have the better players surrounding their main guys. Curry and KD with Klay and Draymond are much better than Lebron and Love (if he is healthy) with Jeff Green and Tristan Thompson. Don’t expect any game to be in single digits. Add in fact Ty Lue is the worst coach to ever win a title and Kerr is the best coming out of half this will not be fun to watch.\u003cbr/\u003e3.

Cavs don\u0026rsquo;t have the defensive or offensive stamina to keep up with Golden Stats high powered offense. The Cavs may get lucky and win one game but the later the series goes on the more worn down LeBron will get and therefore the less effective the Cavs offense will be.\u003cbr/\u003e3.

After that, it\u0026rsquo;ll go back and forth with Cavs and warriors wins, with the Warriors taking it in 6. However, Lebron still pulls out two forty point games.\u003cbr/\u003e3.

Don’t get me wrong, I want the Cavs, but the warriors are WAY too stacked for LeBron to carry the Cavs to a Finals win. The Warriors have so many weapons offensively, that I don’t think the Cavs can stop. Lebron needs his help to be playing well because as we all know, as great as Lebron is, this game is a TEAM sport.\u003cbr/\u003e3. Curry. I can see Lebron and Durant battling head-to-head, but if Curry is firing on all cylinders, the warriors become very tough to beat.\u003cbr/\u003e4. KD. Amidst all the hate, I foresee him shining at the MVP spot.\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eJames Shippy\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e1. Warriors in 5\u003cbr/\u003e2. Let’s be honest there isn’t a human being on this planet that will pick the Cavs to win. I would love nothing more than to see a competitive series but the Cavs (really just LeBron) are outnumbered here. What the Warriors will do to them these next couple of weeks will be nothing short of taking candy from a baby.

I personally really appreciate the way Ekko unabashedly wails on “Not the One,” as it shows me a different, but equally angsty side of his artistry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e“Stay” by Post Malone\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4H7WNRErSbONkM06blBoGc\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e Is Post Malone crusty as hell? Yes. Does he continue to make catchy, melancholy songs that are perfect for those frosty LA nights? Yes, and “Stay” is no exception. If you were that kid in high school who said things like, “Man, I wish Mayday Parade had more slowed down, acoustic tracks,” then you’re gonna love this song.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e“‘Til It’s Over” by Anderson .Paak\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0zYkf4pCiGAhEp5Z3iUkml\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003eBut Alexa, you protest, isn’t this a happy song? It’s so cheerful and laidback-sounding! What’s it doing on this depressing ass playlist? But that’s where you’re wrong, my friend. Any song can be an emo song if you listen to it in the proper emo state of mind. When .Paak sings, “Say, can’t a young man dream?/Can’t we all live life on a widescreen,” are you smiling? Are you crying? Are you optimistic about your future, or crippled by your past? Who can say?\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e“Chilly” by NIKI\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2YYjP4oIs1iVlzHb5rXgUC\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003eNIKI references the month of December in this song, but its overarching themes of solitude and bittersweet goodbyes are perfect for angsty listeners year round. I like to listen to this song when I’m putting away laundry or washing dishes, and before I know it my chores have come to a halt and I’m staring out my window wondering if I’ll ever be able to experience a love without selfishness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e“VCR” by The xx\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4vU90MimdQpV2e1wPi1ljJ\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003eIt’s not a new song, but this playlist wouldn’t be complete without a) a song by The xx, a band so broody that sometimes they all wear black turtlenecks at the same time, and b) a painful throwback to the year 2009.

    "title": "Radimo LA Runway @ Junior High (05/06/18) // Show Review",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhotos and article by Gomi Zhou\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am known to be someone who has high expectation for everything, and with that comes frequent disappointments. I woke up stressed out again on the day of the Radimo x Junior High runway show. As usual, I ended up setting inhumanly high expectation for the night.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI also came with worries. I worried that just like many other major queer events nowadays this was going to be another white-washed night. Since some online influencers were also walking and had been promoting the show, I worried that maybe it would once again, inevitably turn out to be a YouTube meet \u0026amp; greet. And mainly, I was worried because I’m still trying to get used to this newly introduced queer lifestyle for myself. It was just a lot of self-doubt, really. After years of calling myself straight and convincing myself that I was straight, I worried that I wouldn’t be able to fit right in with a crowd who had long been comfortable with who they are.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the runway show still came out (no pun intended) to be everything I could have ever asked for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e7pm on the dot, I arrived at Junior High and a few kids had already got there. Assuming that they were fans of some of the influencers, most of them were surprisingly shy and quiet, contemplating with each other whether they should walk into the venue at such an early time. I also saw some parents, which I was once again surprised by, since mine will never be this supportive when it comes to this particular topic. Walking in, the space itself was lovely. Junior High looked like your typical neighborhood nonprofit organization but just with a lot more teenage angst and a lot more pink\u0026ndash;which I found comforting. The pink neon signs, pins that said things like “GENDER IS OVER” felt so comforting to me. This was a space dedicated to the ones who are going through their late teen years and adolescence, the ones who are constantly on the search for an opportunity to speak up and learn but often neglected by the arrogant society who had deemed them as naive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3495\" data-orig-height=\"5242\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/214464912aaab4797553b40ca3aced1f/tumblr_inline_p8l6ww12ts1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3495\" data-orig-height=\"5242\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eI had a short chat about the detailed layout for the show with Dan, who was the founder of the brand Radimo and the person behind tonight’s show. I could tell they were in a rush to make sure everything was ready to go, but I also noticed the obvious and genuine excitement behind their voice. Then came the long and slightly daunting wait for the actual show. People were all in small groups: the younger kids were mainly on their phones trying to avoid any awkward eye contact, and the adults were chit-chatting with each other about which bar they should hit together afterward. I myself spent the next hour or so talking to the girls who worked at Junior High and the other photographers. Everyone sounded so cool that they all seemed to be a “somebody” who’s working on some “projects”, a very typical scene you could find anywhere else in Los Angeles. To my surprise and comfort, even though the event was stated explicitly as a queer runway show, not once was there a question asked about sexuality. Maybe this was a given for the other attendees, but for me, a “baby queer” as one of my fellow photographers kindly made up the name for, it felt so foreignly accepting with a good type of intimacy. With all the different personalities I encountered before the show, I found it hard to imagine how would each person act in the audience crowd. Obviously, there were your groups of “stereotypical gays”, who were outgoing and ready for a good time; but the majority of the people looked just as awkward and timid as I was, feeling both excited and slightly nervous for the upcoming fashion show that was deemed to be “revolutionary” for the queer community. As it got closer to showtime, people started piling in. The more people there were in the same room, the more diverse the crowd had become. People in different age groups, ethnicities, occupations were all here for one reason: we were there to see a queer runway show, to support the queer community that we all love.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3455\" data-orig-height=\"5182\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/649f1e36dabdbcef8b4a316139d2f5ab/tumblr_inline_p8l6xyPCsP1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3455\" data-orig-height=\"5182\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe runway soundtrack replaced the leftover awkwardness. Almost without warning, the first model walked out. With a loose striped shirt tucked into a knee-length student dress, they walked out with a notepad in their hand. They swayed their hair from side to side, delicately strode down the runway with sass. “YESSSS,” excited voices were as loud as the Beyoncé remix, everyone in the crowd was screaming and cheering now. The crowd was now acting as a whole that everyone was wearing an identical smile and screaming with joy and pride. The same dress and shirt were then worn by several other models who had different heights and different body curves, showcasing the different ways the same design could be worn in different ways by different people. After several outfits being showcased in this way, models started to stop in the middle of the runway and exchange articles of clothing from one person to another. One model would take off their silky flowery cardigan, hand it off to the next model so they could tie it around their waist. The two beautiful models would then walk down the runway hand in hand, showered once again by the overly excited and amazed crowd. The idea of gender was constantly being challenged round after round. All of the pieces were worn by at least two different people in two different ways. Models were presenting these designs in masculine and feminine manners, sometimes both manners at the same time. The gender of the models no longer mattered that everyone was equally as beautiful, proud and most importantly, happy as they strode with the confident smiles on their faces.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3648\" data-orig-height=\"5472\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3fa10f575abfa67c493ca97c1fc801ee/tumblr_inline_p8l6x6ZT3A1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3648\" data-orig-height=\"5472\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the last set of models walked out, there was a split second of silence. Everyone in the crowd, including me, collectively gasped at the scene in front of us. Then all I could hear were roaring cheers, filling the room with love and love only. Miles, someone who I had been watching on YouTube ever since I was still denying myself, who had been advocating for LGBTQ+ rights since the very first day of his career, who just went through his top surgery, walked out bare-chested with the most muscular model of the night. Hand in hand wearing skirts and high heel boots, they strode slowly down the runway with confidence and pride. Emotions washed through me, not only because Miles had been one of the most important influences for my own journey, but the fact that this representation for the most discriminated against members of the LGBTQ+ community was done with apparent ease and showered by tremendous support in the room. The last time I met Miles, for the first time in my life I came out to a whole room of people despite the fact that it was being recorded from all angles; six months later, I was here sharing this evolutionary night with my beautiful community, for the first time without feeling like I was out of place. Six months ago, Miles was insecure as he kept on getting misgendered even though he had been on testosterone for a few months; and now, he was striding down a queer runway show confidently in front of a whole room of beautiful queer people. It’s crazy what six months can do, it’s crazy how much one can grow in just six months when you are surrounded by support\u0026ndash;in this case quite literally.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy favorite thing about meeting new people or people who I look up to is that after you hugged each other, the smell of the other person would get carried by your hair and clothes for the rest of the day. I tried thanking as many people as possible, hugged a few who I had been following on the internet for literally years, and strode out of Junior High with no regard of the concept of gender but filled with love. I still have so much to learn when it comes to being queer and being comfortable with myself, and it can certainly be scary sometimes when you are living with a rather rare sexuality by yourself. But this night gave me so much faith and courage. The show by Radimo at Junior High visually challenged the concept of genders while accepted everyone in the room under the umbrella term “queer”. At the end of the day, love is love, and no one can deny someone for simply being themselves and feeling beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5472\" data-orig-height=\"3648\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/49ad078e6a54716ac3139dd395eef676/tumblr_inline_p8l6xgUEYl1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5472\" data-orig-height=\"3648\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

From the death of her mother to the comfort of marriage, she sings with precision, knowing what her sound is and owning it. Coming to the live stage with spirit and the occasional humorous side comment about celebrity sightings, Zauner was a delight to see. \u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePortland based And And And and Snail Mail opened. And And And was a pandemonium of strong bass and passionate screaming, heavy and punk rock. Indie-pop Snail Mail sings about the conflict that comes with growing up; at only eighteen years old, her artistry of songwriting is already present. Her songs are cathartic yet nuanced.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen came Zauner. With her light up shoes and blue eyeshadow, her stage presence was all energy; she jumped around the stage with a giddy smile on her face. From watching her, you can tell how much she loves music, as she is barely able to contain her excitement. Even though her songs are about serious subjects, so much of her music is upbeat, from the dance-inducing “Everybody Wants to Love You” to “Road Head.” Her husband plays on stage with her, and seeing their smirks at each other is endearing. When she introduced “Till Death,” she looked at him, as if describing the song to him and not the audience, and the love between the two was palpable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3024\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/3dcca2f6da87d0b48af9d0bcc202ca01/tumblr_inline_p7lxnsFsiV1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3024\" data-orig-height=\"4032\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Boyish” is an anthem for self-love, as she criticizes the people in her life who never found her appearance appealing enough. Similar to the music video, she lowered a disco ball to the center of the stage, and she introduced the song as being about “wanting to feel pretty.” It’s a fuck you to the boys who used her but did not value her, to the longing of wanting to be enough. Her performance was biting, a painful but real song of desire.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the slower tracks - “This House” and “Here Come the Tubular Bells” - she had all but one band member leave. These two songs were her chance to slow the dancing, to get personal. Ultimately, Zauner’s music deals with pain, so not all of her songs can be upbeat. This part of the performance was still engaging, a fitting change of pace.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAsian American women need greater representation in the music industry. Zauner serves as a start to what could be, and she does so unapologetically. Her stage presence is so big and joyous and open \u0026ndash; you want to be closer, to know all of the stories that led her to where she is now. Zauner knows how to craft intimate ballads that suck you in, and her delicate voice only captivates you further. She has an unadulterated fascination and talent for her craft, and she does not restrict it. She writes about difficult subjects and the listener can feel the raw emotions behind her words.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"4032\" data-orig-height=\"3024\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/70e850b64f717c169284936b2dca19c3/tumblr_inline_p7lxo6L6LH1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4032\" data-orig-height=\"3024\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eZauner’s performance is one of the most infectious live shows I have seen.

Kidding, as Moby is certainly no stranger to a sad song \u0026ndash;a personal favorite is the aptly titled “When It’s Cold I’d Like to Die” from \u003ci\u003ePlay\u003c/i\u003e (1995). Moby’s fifteenth studio album, the highly emotional \u003ci\u003eEverything Was Beautiful and Nothing Hurt\u003c/i\u003e, was released on March 2 of this year. This record is blanketed in a deep melancholy; it is likely that the album is a reaction to and a reflection of the current political climate. Moby layers anguished spoken-word vocals on several of the tracks, which add to the air of desperation\u003cbr/\u003eelicited by the record. The monotone of Moby’s voice works as an effective overlay for the desolate trip-hop beat, while the world is lyrically framed as a barren, hopeless, and depraved place. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s easy to imagine that this album was recorded as a form of catharsis, and I can only hope that some of the misery expressed through the album was alleviated \u0026ndash; because this is a troublingly mournful release. The record is past a place of frustration, instead playing as a reluctant acceptance of the inherent malice present in the universe. The guest vocalists also add a beautiful, soulful dimension to the album, allowing a spot of brightness in an otherwise bleak tracklist. Especially notable are Mindy Jones’ soothing vocals on “The Waste of Suns” and “The Last of Goodbyes.” The album artwork, a bull reading to his calf, is an allusion to Moby’s well-known vegan advocacy. The single artwork for “Like a Motherless Child,” a close-up of the young calf, confirms this interpretation. Essential tracks from the album include “This Wild Darkness,” “The Middle Is Gone,” as well as the melodic, futuristic “The Waste of Suns.” \u003ci\u003eEverything Was Beautiful and Nothing Hurts \u003c/i\u003ediscloses intimate pain and is thus distressing, but\u003cbr/\u003eit remains listenable, and enjoyably so.\u003c/p\u003e",

Comparisons to Tame Impala will certainly be drawn in regard to this contemporary alternative/psychedelic rock band, and not without reason. The dreamy synth, warm, full-feeling timbre, and slow tempo give both groups, to put quite bluntly, a very high feeling. “In Your Arms” by Sunbeam Sound Machine epitomizes this—the gradual ascension and descension of the compressed guitars paired with repetitive lyrics proclaiming a simple need that “all I want to is to feel like the only one in your arms” elicits the simple feeling of just wanting to be with another person. And perhaps that is the genius in the song. It doesn’t try to make complexities out of an uncomplicated feeling—life and love can be as simple as lying in the sun, with someone. \u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Business Casual @ The Improv Space // Comedy Review",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003earticle by Moses Mascuch\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Business Casual is a three man improv team. And Business Casual gets sweaty. After their recent show at the Improv Space, as this writer approached the members Business Casual for congratulatory (and masculinity-affirming) back pats, I detected with each clap between the shoulders a telltale wetness. But this is not the sweat of just any comedian under hot lights. This is the sweat of a group of performers who pile into the family car, throw a brick on the gas pedal, and steer onto the freeway. Their show at the Improv Space was Business Casual in top form, a riotously funny mix of sketch and improv comedy propelled by high-energy performances and an ironic and raunchy sense of humor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSweat wasn’t the only fluid on display at their show. Members were spat on, bled from wounds, and several characters masturbated on stage, at least one to completion, leaving a tangible and impressively large load on stage, which was later sheepishly cleaned up. This is all to say that a lot of comedic ground was covered in the Business Casual forty-five minute performance. The show opened with a musical number set to “All That Jazz,” complete with enthusiastically performed choreography. An immediate transition saw the members now being arrested, interrogated about what they did last summer, and put on trial. How does Business Casual get out of this jam? A plea from Jeremy Elder to the invisible judge: “Can we start the show please?” From there, the audience was treated to a suite of sketches, most under a minute. These sketches shared a structure: the title or subject matter of a sketch would be announced, and then a brief scene would take place, typically subverting expectations. For example, a sketch announced as “zipping up your fly,” is, in fact, a father zipping up the backpack of his half-human, half-fly son. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe sketches were arranged skillfully, with jokes reappearing, often with a slight twist, between multiple sketches. Structurally, most sketches, given their interactions with their titles, had some element of wordplay, so occasionally punchlines could be guessed at from titles. But even when one might anticipate the punchline of a sketch, what’s undeniable is the gusto with which these punchlines are delivered. Even the most jaded comedy snob wouldn’t be able to resist laughing at Hunter Saling’s (as the man-fly) pitch-perfect delivery of the sketch’s final line: “Nyeah, I’m a fly!” One other note on Business Casual’s sense of humor: those who enjoy jokes about buttholes, jerking off, or, shall we say, the physical act of love, will certainly find their interests represented in the sketches of Business Casual. But these raunchy elements are always well incorporated into sketches, they’re never taken to be funny simply by existing. When Corey Lane jerks off at the Thanksgiving table, it’s not just the action itself that’s funny, but rather how he has played on expectations of what unbuckling one’s belt after a meal might be. Perhaps Business Casual can be seen to be within a certain lineage a comedy, where bawdy material is done smartly; comedy that may be vulgar, but isn’t crude.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom sketches, the show then segued into improv. In this section, it was clear just how tight-knit Business Casual is as a group. The three have been performing together since their Freshman years, and it shows. Each member of the group seemed to be both performing an individually realized character, and yet remained in tandem with his two co-performers. I write this as a relative improv novice, who perhaps hasn’t entirely shed the wide-eyed yokel attitude of “Ya really don’t write any o’ that stuff down beforehand?” and as such, I may not be attuned to the subtleties of what makes truly masterful improv. But in my view, I witnessed some an impressive performance. Characters and storylines were spun out and developed with grace, and comedic premises seemed to blossom naturally out of the dialogue, a testament to the comfort these performers have with each other. What struck me about the improv, as with the sketches, was the pure energy behind the performances. Even when the improv felt a little directionless, or seemed to lack a premise, the energy of the performers kept the audience engaged until the hilarity started. There was never a sagging moment where an audience member would be able to disengage from the comedy and perhaps execute a covert phone-check. Business Casual was truly captivating.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerhaps the best review of Business Casual doesn’t come from my own experience of their recent show, but from the friend who accompanied me to it. He knew, having a hard commitment at 9 pm, that he would not be able to see the whole show. And yet, when the time came for him to leave, my friend was extremely reticent. So engaged was he in Business Casual’s comedy that the act of getting up from his seat seemed to cause him physical pain. If Business Casual is looking for a promotional slogan, feel free to steal this one: comedy so good it hurts to say goodbye.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eArticle and photographs by Noelani del Rosario-Sabet\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eBuds\u003c/i\u003e was the album that stole my heart. My eighteen-year-old self listened to it on repeat as I waited to leave the meth-infested small town I lived in. I wanted to be a goth babe in LA. When I heard that Surf Curse would be performing the entirety of \u003ci\u003eBuds\u003c/i\u003e, I not only decided to go, but to take my twelve-year-old sister as well. You’re never too young to fall in love with punk, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUsually, I arrive late to skip the first act. At the tender age of twenty, I already feel as if I have the stamina of a seventy-year-old. There’s no way I can last through openers and headliners and still be able to drive home. This time, however, I let myself be persuaded by my boyfriend who was adamant about seeing the opener: Brutus VIII.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"650\" data-orig-width=\"975\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/23616e411f97858495b9ba6e6b0660c9/tumblr_inline_pc3b0gfilo1qhakxc_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"650\" data-orig-width=\"975\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eBrutus VIII was like listening to the punk embodiment of a horror movie. The singer was a character. Not just any character; he was a badass motherfucker. He’s the kind of guy who will make you swoon and rip your heart out\u0026hellip;with his bare hands.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike other openers I’ve seen, Brutus VIII really knew how to draw a crowd. Everyone moshed and danced until the singer demanded that they stop. The obedient crowd listened (for the most part) until he ended the set by diving into the sweaty bodies of moshers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNext up was Surf Curse and I was able to edge my sister and me to the front. The show started with someone flipping off the stage, just barely missing the top of my sister’s head. That’s when the crowd starting churning and bouncing and mushing and mashing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"650\" data-orig-width=\"975\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/aa6328ed5838f73f97f2395cedcff9c3/tumblr_inline_pc3b0vITn71qhakxc_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"650\" data-orig-width=\"975\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt should also be noted that about 50 of these people started lining up at 5pm in the blistering heat wave. They should definitely be given props for their dedication to melt in the sun for hours and still have the energy to mosh.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor this show, it was just Nick and Jacob performing. The original duo, just like “the good old days.” They would play a song, stop if they didn’t feel it was right, joke around a little, and tell stories from when they lived in Las Vegas. It all felt very intimate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"650\" data-orig-width=\"975\" style=\"\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0d47fee3711d35fd385e1c54cfc76b6a/tumblr_inline_pc3b1aT3Ia1qhakxc_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"650\" data-orig-width=\"975\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore each song, they would give a little anecdote about how it came to fruition. One that particularly resonated with me was the story of “Ponyboy”. Nick told a story about a night he spent with his ex playing with an Ouija board in a cemetery. It reminded me of the kinds of things my friends and I would do in my hometown. Jacob’s story about going to The Smell for the first time was also heartwarming for any punk kid who grew up outside of Los Angeles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s what Nick and Jacob were really good at.

    "title": "Iceage @ The Regent (6/6/18) // Show Review",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhotographs and article by Tara Kazimi\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs of late Iceage has pared themselves down to the extreme, they’ve departed any sort of rhythmic existence and have been cruising through a simultaneously temporary evanescent persona and evermore state of being. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1035\" data-orig-height=\"1471\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7850fe750e9bf93d0d27ee7465911385/tumblr_inline_pc0ye5lcws1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1035\" data-orig-height=\"1471\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis has been achieved through the transmutation they are now known for. For early die-hard fans of Iceage this may come as a disappointment as the early sounds of\u003ci\u003e New Brigade\u003c/i\u003e have long been set aside (as far as anyone knows, currently at least) to make room for this fast-fusion love child called \u003ci\u003eBeyondless\u003c/i\u003e. On one hand you can ask, “what band has ever kept the same exact sound throughout their career?” but on the other, what band has ever matured, slicked-back, cleaned up, and progressed their sound this soon and this quick throughout their career? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIceage’s recent show at The Regent, in support of their latest record \u003ci\u003eBeyondless\u003c/i\u003e, is a good testament to that. While the crowd seemed to echo frontman Elias Rønnenfelt’s drunken but classy theatrics, the punks there that bled \u003ci\u003eNew Brigade\u003c/i\u003e could easily be picked out. You could see the frustration in their eyes when coming to the realization that early Iceage would never take control in the way they wanted. Instead this uncompromising rugged but forever chic gothic-pop drone enveloped the space. Their latest record was mainly on display, songs like “Thieves like us”, “Pain Killer”, Catch it”, and “Hurrah” caught extra commotion. They did dip into “Plowing Into the Field of Love” a bit to the relief of some. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2292\" data-orig-height=\"1542\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/22e263b52e85fadfc92573abad5bc63e/tumblr_inline_pc0yehzw6L1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2292\" data-orig-height=\"1542\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile the music has grown, at least Rønnenfelt’s appearance has seemed to plateau to the satisfaction of his punk idolizers. He still emerges sharp and lustrous, tipsy and drowsy, unforgivable and unforgiving. While he longs to transcend, it is always in hopes his crowd stays the same with as high of energy as ever, and he makes sure of it. While performing he absent-mindedly kicks himself into the front row, constantly throwing the mic’s wire into the faces of those that stood out earliest to see him up front. A couple knees to the face but not a care in the world. He longs to interact and create chaos, even if it has its expenses. Nonetheless, it seems as if he and the band are on such a pedestal that it was a pleasure to endure, the aggression was welcome, and disorder was urged. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThroughout the show, the artist Roger Ballen’s Boarding House series kept continuously coming to mind. The Boarding House is a transient place in the human psyche, a strange place where people come and go for elementary existence and immediate survival. The body or the home can constitute as a boarding house in certain situations, it just matters how they are confronted and used as a means for continuance. In a way Iceage felt to be a boarding house, this required an anomalous form of relief that everyone longs for when in a rut. That’s why no matter where Iceage goes, whether in demeanor or sound, they’ll be a Need no matter what. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Their third album, \u003ci\u003eFar From Earth\u003c/i\u003e, was just released a few weeks ago on this latest Friday the 13th if that gives any clue to their aesthetic. Since their first recorded album all the way back in 2011, they’ve developed a thunderous groovy sound and drifted to the forefront of the neo-psychedelic rock scene, touring with everyone from King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizards to Fleetwood Mac. Their songs drip with heavy psychedelic guitars, reverb, echoing harmonies, and distinctive wailing female vocals. I’ve truly never seen a mouth open as wide and passionately as the lead singer’s does as she belts over her drum kit \u0026mdash; that’s right, their lead singer drums too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI insist on first emphasizing their musical prowess for fear you’ll get distracted by what every other profile opens with: Stonefield is an all-girl band of four beautiful sisters, ages 20 to 28. I urge you not to overlook their talent for their charm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"814\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/69743caeaf63203983712276b390c944/tumblr_inline_p9ivvcvXQI1qhakxc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"814\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe band just finished their April residency at the Bootleg Theater, and we got a chance to talk to them at their last show before they returned to their native Australia.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eYou just came out with a new album, how would you describe the evolution of your sound? How would you describe the differences, especially from your second to third album?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAmy:\u003c/b\u003e It’s definitely matured… like a fine wine. I think we’ve just gotten better at songwriting and better at expanding away from a typical song structure, or idea of writing a song.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eHannah:\u003c/b\u003e And also kind of realizing how to create something that we want to listen to or that we’re envisioning. I think we’ve probably improved a lot on that front.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eAmy:\u003c/b\u003e Broadening influences as well. I think that probably for this last record, we listened to a lot more newer bands than other records, which probably affected the sound.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eHannah:\u003c/b\u003e And also, I suppose the biggest part was that we kind of just went and wrote it without telling anybody. So we weren’t thinking about anyone else.\u003cbr/\u003eAmy: We weren’t hearing other opinions during the writing process.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eHannah: \u003c/b\u003eWhich, as much as you try not to let that affect you, it’s always going to somehow affect you a little bit. So it was nice to not worry about that and just do it for ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eYou said you were listening to newer music, do you guys listen to music together? Do you spend a lot of time together? Do you spend ALL your time together?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAmy:\u003c/b\u003e *\u003ci\u003elaughing*\u003c/i\u003e We spent four days in a van, listening to music, nonstop.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eHolly:\u003c/b\u003e I feel like we’re very similar in the sense that we like the same clothes, we’re into the same music, into the same movies, we like everything that each other likes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow does being sisters affect your band?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHolly:\u003c/b\u003e I feel like being in a band is such a different experience with sisters. Like if I played in a band with friends it’d be so different.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eHannah: \u003c/b\u003eWe definitely probably wouldn’t have lasted as long as we have if we weren’t sisters.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eHolly: \u003c/b\u003eWell it depends on the people that you’re playing with.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eAmy: \u003c/b\u003eI reckon maybe we don’t push each other as much as… maybe sometimes because we’re too comfortable. I reckon being too comfortable with each other could stop us from pushing each other musically. But at the same time, we do work really hard and do tell each other to work really hard.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWe were listening to a bunch of interviews, and every interviewer really emphasizes that you are young women, sisters, and we were wondering if that’s annoying to you, if it discounts you, or if you appreciate the recognition in that way.\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHolly:\u003c/b\u003e It’s annoying.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eAmy:\u003c/b\u003e It’s really annoying.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eSarah: \u003c/b\u003e‘Young, young’… yeah, it’s so annoying.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eHannah: \u003c/b\u003eIt shouldn’t be about that, it should be about the music.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eHolly: \u003c/b\u003eLike it’s okay but at the same time it’s like, you should recognize us for being in a band, not just because we’re women, that makes us good, you know?\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat do you think about the state of women in music, in the industry?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAmy:\u003c/b\u003e Well I think that it’s crazy that it still is the way that it is.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eHannah:\u003c/b\u003e And that it still has to be a talking point, that “is it harder for women.” It should just be the same, it should just be equal. It is actually just insane that it’s still a thing.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eHolly:\u003c/b\u003e Like Amy was saying the other day that music festivals in Australia are putting this thing forward where it’s like, by 2020 the lineups of festivals are going to be 50-50 male-female ratios, but like Amy was saying, why does it have to be by 2020? Just do it now. There are plenty of female artists that could be put up on the lineup that are just as good if not better than other male bands.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eAmy:\u003c/b\u003e Even someone here the other night, that works in the industry, was like, “You can really play! You can really play. You’ve got a story, it’s very marketable. You’re sisters.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eHolly: \u003c/b\u003e“You’ve got the looks.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eHannah:\u003c/b\u003e Right, he said “You’re four young good-looking girls… and you can play.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eAmy: \u003c/b\u003eSo like, it’s annoying.

Amy also clued us into farm rock \u0026ndash; as she explained, “They sing about their tractors… which sounds really weird but it’s really cool.

Because I’m the youngest, she’s the oldest, there’s eight years between us, so like, there’s quite an age gap really, and I reckon that we wouldn’t hang out as much as what we do.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eAmy: \u003c/b\u003eBut then Hannah and I live in the city, and Sarah and Holly live at home in the country. So we go home to the country to practice and write and stuff, so we see each other all the time, and Mom and Dad. We probably wouldn’t even see Mom and Dad as much as we do because they’re there when we practice. Yeah, I think we definitely are closer because of it. We always have been close, before this.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eHolly:\u003c/b\u003e Sometimes it’s like, maybe not a good thing! ‘Cause we hang out with each other all the time.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eAmy:\u003c/b\u003e We’d probably be nicer to each other if we didn’t see each other all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDo you have a favorite song you like to play together?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAmy: \u003c/b\u003eI like playing “Love” because it’s a real groovy kind of song, it’s a song where you really can lock into each other really well, I think.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eSarah: \u003c/b\u003eI like the heavy ones.

It’s so, so different here.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eHannah: \u003c/b\u003eI do think the main reason that we do find it so hard to adjust is because…I think it’s really important to surround yourself with people that make you feel comfortable, and that you’re kind of used to hanging out with.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eHolly:\u003c/b\u003e It really makes me laugh because whenever we see anything that’s comforting we’re like, “man that’s comforting,” like anything that reminds us of home. It’s just really funny. Well not even just reminds us of home but just… like the other night we were at that burger place, Sonic, *\u003ci\u003elaughter*\u003c/i\u003e and this car of dudes were next to us and they were just being so rowdy and they were like “where are you girls from?” and all that stuff, and it was like late at night and we’d been driving for ages and we were feeling homesick and we were like “ugh this is gross,” and then this car just pulled up to us of these two guys and they were just like laughing at how ridiculous this place was as well and we were like, that’s so comforting. I don’t know what the point of that story was, *\u003ci\u003elaughing*\u003c/i\u003e but just that we find things really random comforting.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eAmy:\u003c/b\u003e It’s just a totally totally different city to Melbourne, so it is hard to adjust. In saying that, we do adjust pretty well, considering, because we’re used to traveling all the time and sleeping in a different bed every night and whatever. But the music scene here is so cool! Like we’ve played with so many amazing bands, people come out and support music. People do at home as well but it seems like such a bigger thing over here which is really exciting, and definitely a bigger audience for our type of music in particular, which is amazing.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eHolly:\u003c/b\u003e I feel like the more time we spend here, the better it gets, because you find the spots.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eAmy:\u003c/b\u003e It’s been good spending a month here because it does allow you the time to be like, ‘that place is good,’ ‘the coffee here is really good,’ which is cool to actually have the time to discover things so it’s been really fun.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat are your personalities like, in relation to each other?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHolly:\u003c/b\u003e Well Amy, who is the oldest, and me, I’m the youngest, clash reeeaaally badly, because we’re so similar.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eSarah:\u003c/b\u003e They’re very alpha personalities, I would say.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eHolly:\u003c/b\u003e Like, we both have very strong opinions and it has to be our way.

The normal pre-show anxiety and mindless chit chat was entirely absent, replaced instead with smiling faces, genuine compliments, and complete and total inclusivity.

Frontman Kevin Barnes’ revealing outfits and glamorous hair and makeup showed fans just how beautiful it was to feel comfortable in your own skin.

Their latest tour, Lights Out America, is a more than sufficient testimony to that. After a month of gut wrenching, aggression provoking, and stimulative, basically back to back shows, Ho99o9 finished the final leg of the tour in Los Angeles at 1720 on April 27. Located in downtown Los Angeles, 1720 is the warehouse no one thought they needed. It was spacious yet intimate, had a modern industrial feel, and was surrounded by free parking. It captured and executed a tangible presence that encapsulated Ho99o9 quite well. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUpon approaching the venue, the crowd seemed to mainly consist of white metalheads that were obviously there for 3TEETH. To make the situation even more pressing, when entering the venue, the bouncer had to ask me if I was at the right show. Other than the fact that I was dressed in red head to toe, it was easy to tell that I definitely didn’t stand out from their fan demographic. Surprisingly enough, that momentum never terminated as the night drew on. However, something about that divided crowd revealed a deeper submerged aspect to Ho99o9 that I believe even they didn’t realize was being transmitted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2592\" data-orig-height=\"1728\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/558e2626ff7762c4fd24af94e02a7f6e/tumblr_inline_p89pruQD081qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2592\" data-orig-height=\"1728\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Eaddy and theOGM thought that the most fitting entrance would be one filled with obscurity. Following through, they came onto a blacked out stage for their first song, continuing with certain frame points only lit by the single light coming from the motorcycle helmet theOGM wore. While known for the theatrics intertwined within their live show, the motorcycle helmet portal sucking light was as theatrical as they got that night. Which I don’t mean to bring up in a bad way, but in a way of freedom and obstruction from an overblown presence that is thought to only be present to make up for a deficit. Of course, Ho99o9 is blood, they are twisted gore, melodramatic visual chaos that seeps through everyone’s pores. But that in no way is to say that their identity is dependent on it; in fact Ho99o9 is in such a transformative and advanced artistic zone that their semblance seemed to come across even more vibrantly when on hiatus and completely naked from all the stagecraft. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2592\" data-orig-height=\"1728\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2bb412b90246973d23edcb247ec643b9/tumblr_inline_p89q104hV21qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2592\" data-orig-height=\"1728\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a \u003ca href=\"https://www.vibe.com/2018/05/the-philosophy-of-ho99o9-interview/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epast Vibe interview\u003c/a\u003e, theOGM stated that that “those [3TEETH] ni**as are tight, they’re straight industrial. They’re music is dark and sexy. I’m trying to make dark and sexy music. All we’re making is angry music, two black men.” Ho99o9 survives and thrives within a unique state of limbo, a pulsating world between sensuality and anarchy, something much more than just angry music by two black men. They hold the ability to in one instance play “Street Power,” mechanically oscillating and angering the blood, and in the next play “Splash,” electrifying an erotic susceptibility. Despite their rigid exterior, seductive connotations withstood the pressure and were prevalent everywhere. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvery spit of genius that comes out of Ho99o9 seems to come from within, never intentionally, which is a test of their subconscious and currently unmaterialized talent. Some time into their set, Sinatra’s “My Way” blasted through the speakers. Eaddy then admitted that he just wanted to take a break, that there was “too much running around, too much horror,” really completing the circle. Even the crowd was able to feel this softer dimension never thought to be associated with them, as throughout the rest of the night couples could be seen grinding up on each other and making out within the pit. It’s a truly strange and enlightening experience to realize that rap-punk isn’t as one-note as you may believe, that even a concept this raw and diabolical can still be layered. Ho99o9 was able to constrict and refract, transform and reform that night. There is a lot more complexities than meets the eye, they are innovative and metamorphic and will not spare the opportunity to rip through any intestine in sight. It’s hard to describe a night or a presence where transmogrification encapsulates everything that it touched, all at the hands of two mutants born to elude.  For when you bleed the devil it evens the odds, no matter where you go you losing your mind\u0026hellip;Welcome to the deathkult. Pledge allegiance to the triple nines. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2592\" data-orig-height=\"1728\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fcd90d3ecd11f7cd8bcefc3081d01516/tumblr_inline_p89q208GBE1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2592\" data-orig-height=\"1728\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

Although the air was chilly, music lovers generated heat by dancing their hearts out at five unique areas.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eStages\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eQueen’s Domain, a mega structure decorated with lasers, LED panels, and confetti was graced by the likes of Dash Berlin, Tiësto, Alesso, and more. The Mad Hatter’s Castle was hosted by Insomniac’s own renowned bass music brand, Bassrush. In addition, performers such as Kayzo and Kill the Noise helped head-banging fans live out their wildest dreams. Caterpillar’s Garden featured performances by Claptone and Chris Lake, where people could dance to techno and house tunes. The Cheshire Woods Stage, hosted by Insomniac Records, featured Champagne Drip and Discovery Project. No matter what genre, Beyond Wonderland was able to deliver. Trap lovers, bass heads, and ambient fanatics were able to find their stage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1769\" data-orig-height=\"1172\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/062c6dd874eca2f906ae240029301651/tumblr_inline_p7901si84f1qhakxc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1769\" data-orig-height=\"1172\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhoto courtesy of Jake West for Insomniac Events\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFood\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter hours of dancing, attendees feasted on food trucks from around Southern California, including Kogi, Shake Ramen, and Leno’s Tacos.

Happy Toast served rainbow grilled cheese and glitter tater tots for VIP guests to enjoy. While digging into delicious food, VIPs were also able to gain access to a sectioned off area at the front of the stages to enjoy the music in a less crowded setting. While being in the main crowd is an experience, it was also nice to be able to enjoy your space and spread out while in the VIP area. VIPs could also rest their feet and recharge at multiple seating areas, all while enjoying a refreshing beverage and being surrounded by immersive decorations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1773\" data-orig-height=\"1165\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/11cd43e5d05b6c0fcaad650436b0d636/tumblr_inline_p7902ja4931qhakxc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1773\" data-orig-height=\"1165\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eCourtesy of Ivan Meneses for Insomniac Events\u003c/i\u003e \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFinal Verdict\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003ePersonally, Beyond Wonderland was one of the best experiences I have had at an EDM festival in a while. I spent most of my time at Queen’s Domain, where I first saw Elephante put down some bangers and remixes. K?d was also another favorite performer of mine, his presence brought a new type of energy to the festival. Although it did rain towards the end of Day 1, attendees pushed through the cold and kept dancing. I was able to expose myself to new artists, new friends, and new memories. Beyond Wonderland is an event I will never forget. Insomniac will always have a special place in my heart, and hopefully it willfor you, too.\u003c/p\u003e",

This masterful album blends into the typical Current Joys sounds, while incorporating strong elements of nostalgia and melancholy. While the album retains the standard garage sound, the overall constant slow tempo throughout makes the album stand out from past projects. The album is very honest and sad. A feeling of coming-of-age, but also a sense of stagnancy overwhelms the album. Lyrics of painful truths are sung by a broken voice and paired with sounds of wistful guitar loops. The album describes feelings of frustration and stagnation in a current life situation, distance from one’s self mind and being, wanting to be in love while having empty feelings of love. To me, this album is being alone in a cold car on a rainy day. I think the feeling of being stuck and depressed while wanting something else but not knowing is what’s really captured in the slow and steady\u003cbr/\u003esounds of this project. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eA Different Age\u003c/i\u003e is hauntingly and realistically beautiful. Some of my favorite lyrics include, “ Like a life without love God, that\u0026rsquo;s just insane, but a love without a life well, that just happens everyday and I wish I could change, but I\u0026rsquo;ll probably just stay the same,” off of “A Different Age,” and, “Cause I\u0026rsquo;m too young to be part of a dying breed and I\u0026rsquo;m too young to see that it\u0026rsquo;s the breed that\u0026rsquo;s killing me,” off of “My Nights Are More Beautiful Than Your Days.” Although these lines are emotional, the gorgeous instrumentation at times throughout the album breaks my heart a bit more than the lyrics. I highly recommend this album if you need a good cry or are in need of a relatable life perspective. I am in love with this album and hope Current Joys continues making masterpieces such as these in times to come.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten by Spencer Weissman\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDo any of you not have Spectrum? Have you ever just wanted to watch PAC 12 games but seen it was on PAC 12 Network, so you knew your provider does not have it? This is the life of anyone of who does not use Spectrum. PAC 12 Network can only be seen on Spectrum, so most people do not watch the games that are televised on it. All a fan is left with is following a GameCast or Box Score. You never truly get an understanding of what happens in the game. And you do not learn anything about the teams.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat about fans along the East Coast? Even for those that have Spectrum, most do not have the PAC 12 Network. You have to pay an extra fee to get it on the East Coast, for the few fans that have interest in the Conference of Champions. It is not growing a fan base, but rather killing it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat I am getting at is that the lack of exposure to PAC 12 Network and lack of broadcasting of PAC 12 games is what is to blame for Selection Sundays like this year’s. Most fans argued for a small school being robbed of an NCAA Tournament bid over the likes of the PAC 12 schools that got overlooked. The reason for all this? No one outside of the PAC 12 schools watch these games.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe PAC 12 Network is the worst network of all the major conferences. BIG 10 has its own channel that is on every provider, same with SEC. BIG 12 and ACC have deals with ESPN to make sure all of their games are on \u003ca href=\"http://watchespn.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewatchespn.com\u003c/a\u003e. The PAC 12 Network only has one provider producing its games, and most fans of the sport don’t even own that channel. If the PAC 12 Network was on every cable provider I guarantee teams like USC would be dancing right now. UCLA would not be traveling to Dayton. Arizona would be a top 3 seed. All of these do not happen though, because no one watches PAC 12 basketball.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs someone from the East Coast, the going joke is that PAC 12 Network is a myth. No one actually knows it exists. Every major sports bar does not have it. Every home does not have it. Every major fan of the sport does not believe it exists over there, since there is no exposure. If the PAC 12 Network would be put on Verizon, Direct TV, and Optimum, days like this year’s Selection Sunday would never happen again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn order to regain relevance, it is simple: just release your network to all the providers and let people enjoy it. \u003c/p\u003e",

Low End Theory is the\nheart of the ever-flourishing hip-hop and electronic beat scene. It has been\ntied to jumpstarting the careers of artists such as Flying Lotus, Nosaj Thing,\nTokimonsta, the Gaslamp Killer, Daedelus, and The Glitch Mob.

Taking\ncertain segments of certain songs, and presenting them in a way that on their\nown, these songs don’t have a lot to do with each other. But play the right\nsections in the right order, and all the sudden this makes sense.” In other words,\nLow End Theory serves a purpose to piece together the diverse and complex map\nwithin the realm of music. The audio pioneers of Low End Theory are constantly\nbreaking barriers and bringing together the worlds of multiple genres into a\nplace where they can all harmonize as one. The experimentation of this thesis\nhas resulted in giving birth to a new and original sound. This sound has become\nvital to the Los Angeles music culture.

The top is a Los Angeles - Silver Lake coffee shop/bar, with white tinsely hanging lights and candles in mason jars, while the bottom captures London grime.

Moreover, the meticulous\nattention new theory devotes to unpacking historically narrow definitions (e.g.\n‘gender’ and ‘sexuality’) is seen as obtuse nitpicking rather than a truly viable\nreanalysis. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, replace those imagined\nlecture scenarios with a real one, in which feminism (an academic discipline with\nadjacent social movements) is discussed only with vulgarities and coarsely\nmisappropriated terms. This was the caliber of Milo Yiannopoulos’ “Feminism is\nCancer” talk at UCLA on Tuesday, May 31. Its title alone implies not an\nacademic debate but a violent eradication of ‘metastasized’ thought. Yet the\nevent’s organizers, the Bruin Republicans, \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/253819344970893/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebilled it\u003c/a\u003e as part\nof their commitment to “encouraging ideological diversity and promoting\nthoughtful debate on campus.” Should this prefatory disclaimer excuse the\ntalk’s callous and incendiary language? For your consideration I have selected a\ncouple Yiannopoulos quotes from the night’s hideous heap, barely paraphrased and\nwithout excision of expletives:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The males involved in “Black Lives Matter” are\nall skinny, white, and cucked. All the hysterical black women in “Black Lives\nMatter” are fussy because they’re really lesbians.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Teaching is a profession that does not attract\nthe smartest people. It is not a real job. Teachers are fucking idiots and\nleft-wing cunts.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut with blatant hypocrisy he\naccuses the left of “shaming, name-calling, silencing, bullying, and nannying.”\nSo the “thoughtful debate” was in effect a sophist’s orgy of ad hominem\ncomplaints. Of course, this is Yiannopoulos’ platform: the absolute rejection of\npolitical correctness (PC) by absurd and provocative defiance. I recognize that\nmany liberal and conservatives alike interpret political correctness as a\ntyrannical imposition on the First Amendment. People, understandably, do not\nlike to have their values questioned and they do not like to be told what they\nshould say. When intellectuals are the ones questioning values and pushing for\nprogressive linguistic change, people are even less happy because they perceive\nit as belittling condescension. Admittedly, professional intellectuals occupy a\nprivileged position in the United States, and so people without the most\nadvanced (and expensive) education should never be expected to show them subservience.\nBut political correctness is not enslaving anyone to pedants. It is better\ndefined (and this is what I mean when I use it) as a responsible acknowledgement\nof historical transgressions and persisting social inequalities through word\nchoice at the minimum. Thoroughly informed language is the first step in all\nprogress. Rabidly anti-PC rhetoric precludes receptivity to non-normative\nlanguage and thus erects an impenetrable wall of ignorance and apathy. I want\nto be clear that I am not criticizing it for failure to conform to some kind of\nsocial justice dogma; I am criticizing its embrace of linguistic violence and\nits disregard for nuanced thought. As Eve Sedgwick more elaborately states in\n“Queer and Now,” anti-PC rhetoric broadly attempts to \u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e…revoke every available\ncognitive and institutional affordance for reflection, speculation,\nexperimentation, contradiction, embroidery, daring, textual aggression, textual\ndelight, double entendre, close reading, free association, wit––the family of\ncreative activities that might, for purposes of brevity, be more simply called \u003ci\u003ethought\u003c/i\u003e–– they yet stake their claim as\nthe only inheritors, defenders, and dispensers of a luscious heritage of\nthought that most of them would allow to be read only in the dead light of its\npieties and its exclusiveness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\nIn short, with the pretext of\npreventing ‘oppressive’ impositions, it reinforces myopic conventions. This is\nthe case not only with Yiannopoulos but\u003ci\u003e South\nPark\u003c/i\u003e’s characterization of “PC Principal” as the stereotypical social\njustice ‘bro.’ While the show may have some claim to address imperious\ninstances of PC enforcement, it glosses over larger pertinent issues with the\nsame blasé demeanor as Yiannopoulos. Both lionize abrasive humor as a potent\ncritical tool. The loyal audiences are conditioned to adopt this humor in their\nsocial and political lives, and its inherent disdain for any discourse not\nmarked by scorn and self-regard debars their potential for open mindedness.\nHere\u003ci\u003e South Park\u003c/i\u003e is mild compared Yiannopoulos,\nwhose Youtube live-feed comment section mirrors his speech more explicitly but\nwith comparable maliciousness: \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"375\" data-orig-width=\"568\"\u003e\u003cimg data-orig-height=\"375\" data-orig-width=\"568\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b64eed6add9c0e017a537708b2381993/tumblr_inline_o85sr5XdWs1qhakxc_540.png\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote the similarity of these\ncomments to the vitriol that passes for truth in the anonymous forums of \u003ci\u003e4chan\u003c/i\u003e. Its connection to \u003ca href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/live/shooting-at-umpqua-community-college/explaining-4chan/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea\nrecent mass shooting\u003c/a\u003e evidences how hatred on the web may spill into\nreality. The violence Yiannopoulos incites has up to this point been limited to\nthe realm of language: he is incontrovertibly a proponent of hate speech\u003ci\u003e. \u003c/i\u003eHe is an unfortunate proponent of the\nFirst Amendment, which can never be legally abused but can legally be an implement\nof verbal abuse (a real form of abuse). His use for legality, however, ends\nhere. In the talk he follows his endorsement of Donald Trump with the\ntriumphant guarantee: “you’ll be able to say, do, and feel whatever you want!”\nExaggerated, but telling nonetheless. Yiannopoulos supports Trump because he wants\nto ‘liberate’ us from ‘compulsive’ morality. \n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHopefully I have constructed a\ntenable argument so far; now I want to exonerate the anti-Milo protest. Two\ncriticisms have been leveled at those involved:\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe\nprotest impeded the entrance to the auditorium at which Milo Yiannopoulos was scheduled/authorized\nto speak, and therefore infringed on his freedom of speech and the right of his\naudience to peacefully assemble.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe\nprotest could have better confronted Yiannopoulos by calmly countering him in\nhis Q\u0026amp;A as the Bruin Republicans asked, or by ignoring him altogether. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eRegarding the second point, the\norganizers never intended for this event to be a “thoughtful” and “diverse”\ndiscussion, despite their assertions. Look into Yiannopoulos’ history and you\nwill notice the pattern: he riles people up and shuts them down not with\nrational debate but with disparaging insults. When faced with disagreeable\nquestions he can do nothing but laugh, shrug, and allude to vague, sensational claims.\nOr he \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFys6b4NXNU\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edoes nothing at all\u003c/a\u003e.\nAccordingly, protesters did not prepare for the futile and tedious task of calm\ncounterargument; and surely they did not expect resistance to change the minds\nof bigots. The gathering was a conscious refusal to be baited with promises of academic\ndialogue into a trap of certain hate and a reminder that the fallacy of\nmisplaced scale elevates obvious slander to an academic level at which it\ncannot contribute. No more than supple compliance could disregard have made\nthis statement; nonchalance is certainly not listed alongside ethics,\nexcellence, work, and commitment in the \u003ca href=\"http://www.truebruin.ucla.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTrue\nBruin Values\u003c/a\u003e. The appeals for ‘respectable’ debate and casual indifference invoke\na notion of dignity too disconnected from the political arena to have any real\neffect. \u003ci\u003eDecorous\u003c/i\u003e responses, perhaps,\nbut merely postured retreat, a la Yiannopoulos. It delivered these messages to\nhim, and more importantly it questioned UCLA’s sanctioning of the event.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI understand how conflicted the\nadministration is, obliged by the First Amendment to protect even the\nmost puerile, apolitical platforms. But when true hate, flying under the guise\nof political discourse, is given an auditorium and fair consideration, it is\nalso authorized to degrade the integrity of our academic community. On this same\npremise, no white supremacist group would be accepted. Yiannopoulos’ political popularity\nand ‘respectable’ affiliations should not be allowed to mask the patent parallels\nbetween his vile rhetoric and that of organizations with only slightly more\ntransparent agendas of hatred. The administration has called them distinct and\nleaned on the excuse of legality, which we can view alternatively as a feeble\ncrutch or infallible pillar. Neither viewpoint will alter the Constitution and,\nas the 80’s and 90’s have shown, we cannot legally bar hate speech from campus\nwithout winding up at the Supreme Court. Perhaps through instances like\n“Feminism is Cancer” the law’s shortcomings embolden us––this event has in\nfact generated at least \u003ci\u003elatent\u003c/i\u003e\nacademic discussion to reaffirm and bolster progressive movements, and\nimportantly it has shown the full but manageable extent to which Donald Trump’s\npernicious populism threatens UCLA. \nHence I will not end with condemnation, bitterness, or indecision, but\nrather encouragement. As student protesters we proclaim our voice louder and\nmore human by inconveniently existing in a space where the law must permit hateful assembly and speech; where the law does not immediately advocate for the\nvirtues of language and education, we must. \u003c/p\u003e",

It’s not a solitary enterprise created in a lab and consumed in sterile spaces.  It’s the product of hundreds, if not thousands of individual contributions to the finished piece, with each contribution leaving its own unique signature on the product.  I point this out because a great film is a little bit like a miracle. When that many people, points of view and different styles mesh into something cohesive, concise and beautiful, it’s kind of a magical thing.  That being said, none of these things occurred to me while I was taking in I AM WRATH (2016, Dir. Chuck Russell).  It’s one thing to think about a film after you see it.  It’s another thing to know that all along the line, choice after choice was made that eventually resulted in this writer sitting in a theater the night before this review was due, wondering what the hell was going on.  I’m still wondering.  \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI AM WRATH raises a lot of questions.  Who wrote this?  Who green-lit the production?  What backstage deals or blackmail resulted in a project this unfinished being finished?  It’s conceivable that it might be dangerous to trash a Travolta pic in this town – I’m not unaware of how information moves around, but I’m honor bound to say it: Why would my beloved Tony Manero make a movie this bad? \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eI AM WRATH tackles the story of John, a mercenary turned factory manager who returns to his killing ways after his wife is brutally murdered in a mugging gone wrong.  He re-teams with an old Black-Ops buddy, deftly played by Christopher Meloni, and they go on a predictable killing rampage through the underbelly of Colombus, Ohio seeking vengeance and uncovering a conspiracy taking them into the hallowed halls of state government.  It reads a lot like a Nick Cage movie, which it was until Cage quit the role and Travolta stepped in.  Rebecca de Mornay plays the fleeting role of John’s wife Vivian.  Fans of the genre will see hints of every Steven Segal and Charles Bronson film (yes, I’m talking DEATH WISH) from the 70’s and 80’s, a touch of DIE HARD and a splash of TAKEN.  Fans of the genre will also probably come away from this film as confused as I was by it.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA lot of things aren’t clear.  In a world full of formulaic scripts, how are films like this one chosen over others? Why? Does this type of storytelling appeal to foreign markets?  Is it released in the states only as an appeasement to consumers following the career of a particular actor?  Did a film student edit this? Why is John Travolta acting like Liam Neeson and does he know it’s not a good look on him? Does he care? Does anyone care?  It’s hard to imagine that PULP FICTION was released 22 years ago, and that it was a comeback film for Travolta then.  No one has forgotten PERFECT – and frankly I don’t want to – it’s a California classic. But clinging to an archetype that he has assiduously avoided for the length of his career doesn’t change the fact that he’s growing older.  If there’s one character type he has been the master of, it has been that of men who don’t take themselves too seriously.  Vinnie Barbarino, Tony Manero, Vincent Vega, Chili Palmer – every single one of these roles proffered flawed anti-heroes and a sense of humor.  I AM WRATH’s John, on the other hand, is a sour, basset hound of a downer who can’t even knock out his one-liners without looking like he is going to burst into sobs.  Christopher Meloni adds spice, timing and texture to what would otherwise be 90-minute crying break.  Even THE BOY IN THE PLASTIC BUBBLE had a sort of 70’s beauty to it, and I remember it for that smile, those eyes, and Travolta’s easy-going take on terminal illness.  WRATH has none of those things.  WRATH doesn’t even seem to like itself.  I’m not even sure what it is – but I know that it’s wayyyyy beneath John Travolta.  \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By\u003c/i\u003e : Aidan Donahue, UCLA Radio Sports\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date\u003c/i\u003e : 05/18/16\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe highly anticipated opening matchup of Western Conference Finals was a tale of two halves. The Warriors finished the first half up 60-47, riding a wave of swarming defense, gang rebounding, and an offensive flow that led to open 3 point looks. The Thunder would not be deterred. They came out of the locker room with a higher degree of focus and energy than the Warriors. Westbrook and Durant stayed much more aggressive than Steph and Klay. OKC ground out stop-after-stop with tough physical defense. The Thunder were a plus 9 on the boards in the second half, much improved from a minus 2 in the first 24 minutes. The warriors lack of focus was evident on offense: they took hurried shots, and committed 12 turnovers in the second half, as opposed to 2 in the first. In the end, a Durant pullup jumper with 30 seconds left was the dagger that finished off a 108-102 Thunder win. Here are some thoughts on the game:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWestbrook\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWestbrook has risen his game in this year\u0026rsquo;s playoffs, and is probably the MVP of the postseason so far. The most impressive thing about him is how he has been able to maintain his maniacal competitiveness while adding a new found degree of discipline. This discipline is showing up on the defensive end. A freak athlete and hellish competitor, his propensity to gamble and get lost has often plagued him. Not anymore. Save for a few plays were the slippery Curry got away from him, Russell was hounding the MVP. He rarely lost him off the ball, stayed attached to his hip on the pick and roll, and forced him baseline on drives. Curry had 7 turnovers on the game to Westbrook’s 7 steals, a testament to his activity level. Russell\u0026rsquo;s defensive discipline will be key going forward in the series. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003ePace\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePace\u0026ndash; and who is utilizing it\u0026ndash; will be a significant factor in this series. Despite the Warriors famed 3-point attack, the team’s rhythm starts with defense. In the first half, they swarmed passing lanes, utilized their hands, and pestered ball handles into turnovers. When the thunder missed, they gang rebounded. This got the pace flowing for the Dubs, which created penetration, ball movement, and open looks. The warriors do not just profit on the quick looks from a fast break; they utilize the rhythm and penetration generated by pace to get the ball moving around. They have so many playmakers and shooters that this gets them great looks. Their defensive strengths translate to good fast break defense too. Great communication and the army of 6-6 to 6-8 players allow them to pick everyone up with a good matchup.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Although OKC was second in pace this year (to the Warriors first), they found success when they slowed the game down. They run to get Westbrook and Durant in transition, a smart move considering how dominant the two are in space. However, they simply don’t have the team wide playmaking and shooting to hang with the Warriors in and up and down game. They found success on defense when they were able to match up 5-on-5, overloading the strong side, staying attached to the Splash Bros, and forcing the warriors off the 3 point line. Golden State responded by driving to the rim, where they were met by Adams and Ibaka. This defensive scheme generated turnovers, getting Westbrook and Durant easy buckets on the break. The Thunder should attack these opportunities, but refrain from pushing the pace in other situations. This way they will be able to rely on their physical defense, but still benefit from easy fast break looks. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIbaka and the Death Lineup\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The warriors trotted out the death lineup three times this game, and the Thunder responded each time by rolling with Ibaka and another big, usually Adams. This lineup was as successful in containing the Warrior’s juggernaut as any other one has. Ibaka’s versatility is a key part of this. He provides tough interior defense, but still has the speed to run with the quicker Warriors. He also grabbed 11 boards, a key area that the Thunder will need to take advantage of against the smaller lineup. It will be interesting to see if Kerr makes any adjustments to try to free this lineup up more. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSteph, the Pick and Roll, and the Thunder’s Defense\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The Thunder did a good job of guarding the Stephen Curry pick and roll. They blitzed the pick hard nearly every time, forcing Curry to slip the pass to the big, usually Draymond. OKC stayed home on the shooters during this, forcing Draymond to shoot, usually over Adams. Green went 9-20 from the field and shot 9 free throws, efficiently taking advantage of the looks they were giving him. This helped to free Steph up for some of his 6 threes, but the swarming defense forced him into 7 turnovers and 9-22 shooting from the field. Most importantly, they got the ball out his hands in the fourth quarter much more than usual. Curry will respond with a better aggression and control, he seemingly always does. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMoving Forward \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt looks like we have got ourselves the series we all wanted. The Thunder won a gutsy game, taking control after a strong first half from the Warriors. Golden State didn’t play with the level of focus and competitiveness necessary to win in the second half. They were hesitant, careless with the ball, and fouled too much. They will be much more focused in game 2, so I see them coming out with a win at home. What a series we have. \u003c/p\u003e",

That 4th quarter was the most excited I ever got for a non-Timberwolves game ever (try to find that sentence in the history of the internet).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eD: What is funny about the whole Kobe situation, is that it overshadowed arguably a more impressive accomplishment by the Golden State Warriors. While Kobe was taking all the shots, the Warriors were setting the record for most wins in an NBA season by destroying the Grizzlies. 73-9 is nothing to sneeze at. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: I saw on ESPN that the Lakers game peaked at 8 million viewers while the Warriors peaked at 6 million, and the Lakers were on ESPN2! No one has watched ESPN2 for that long since ESPN8: The Ocho went under 10 years ago. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eD: Man I really miss watching lawnmower races and amateur team bowling competitions. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: April 13th, 2016 was a magical basketball day, but quick shout out to the 2016 NBA Dunk Contest for reviving what used to be a dead art, that Aaron Gordon dunk over Stuff the Magic Dragon was the kind of dunk that Vince Carter dreams he would have thought up first.

LULZ. This award goes to the most attractive NBA player because why the hell not? After much debate and some politics, I will was able to convince Daniil about Gordon Hayward being number 1. I mean his hair is perfect Daniil. IT’S PERFECT!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eD: I feel that Dwyane Wade should be higher on this list. When it comes to look, style, and even girlfriend, Dwyane Wade is the complete package for looks in the NBA. I mean Gordon Hayward still lives with his mom and plays League of Legends on off days. How is that hot?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: Nerdy is the new hot Daniil. #Obvs. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eD: I think JJ Reddick was a pretty obvious choice here. He’s only gotten better with age, like a fine wine. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: Yes, his jaw structure is phenomenal. Very typical GQ looking type of guy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eD: Would you rather have Reddick’s jaw structure or Hayward’s hair?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: You already know my hair is flawless, so it’s Reddick’s jaw. Easy choice. Let’s move on before we both lose our masculinity cards, I just made a payment so it’s good ‘till next December and I don’t want to waste that kind of money. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDr. Evil Award\u003cbr/\u003e\u00091.\u0009LeBron James\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e\u00092.\u0009James Harden\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e\u00093.\u0009Charles Barkley\u2028\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eD: So this award goes to the player that we feel is the biggest villain in the NBA. Someone we love to hate. In our case, the first person that totally fits that description is LeBron James. He is the ultimate evil mastermind, pulling strings from behind the scenes to get his coach fired. Using the subtle manipulation technique known as “The Twitter” to constantly undermine his teammates.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: It’s funny because I actually like LeBron, but I’m aware of how much of a whiny, entitled little jerkface he can be sometimes. He’s like that snobbish British elitist you always hope gets what’s coming to them in whatever romantic comedy film starring Ryan Reynolds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eD: However I still think I’d rather be on the same team as LeBron than James Harden. If we extend the romantic comedy analogy, he’s the guy who is only obsessed about himself and does not give the female lead any attention. Harden barely passes to teammates, shoots terrible shots constantly, and complains when he does not receive help from help defenders when he lets an opposing player blow by him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: You had to sell me on this one, but I agree with you now, I don’t think I like him anymore. Everything you said is spot on, and the fact that it took me this long to realize it makes me feel dumb. So s/o to Daniil Loza: NBA Detective Extraordinaire. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eD: Aww shucks. I, a simpleton from the Great Area of the Bay do not deserve such praise. Moving on, Charles Barkley has been the ultimate foil to jump shooting teams everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: His stubbornness on perimeter centric shooting teams has been known for some time, but it’s time we call him out on it. It’s ridiculous to think that just because someone else’s method of success is different from yours, doesn’t mean it’s inferior\u0026ndash;sans Wildcat offence circa 2006 Miami Dolphins\u0026ndash;he needs to be knowledgeable that this type of offense works, and it already won them 1 championship, maybe more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eD: He’s just salty he does not have a ring.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eColumbus Average Joe’s Starting 5\u003cbr/\u003e\u0009PG: George Hill\u003cbr/\u003e\u0009SG: Allen Crabbe\u003cbr/\u003e\u0009SF: Jeff Green\u003cbr/\u003e\u0009PF: Jason Smith\u003cbr/\u003e\u0009C: Robin Lopez\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: This is a fun one, we came up with what we thought was the most average players at each position and end up with what would be around a .500 record, we also chose the most average city: Columbus. I think the easiest decision we settled on was Jeff Green wouldn’t you say?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eD: Agreed. When it comes to mediocrity, nobody personifies it better than good ol’ Jeff Green. All of these players are too good to be cut, but when you look at each one you go\u0026hellip;eh. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: EXACTLY. I think that’s what sold you on George Hill and Robin Lopez, you think of them and just go “Eh, he’s okay.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eD: Who is the leading scorer on this team and who takes the last shot during crunch time? Also would you rather have this roster or the 76ers roster?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: I think your boy Green takes the shot, he’s shown to be pretty clutch actually in past seasons. That follow-up question is really tough, because who would want to pay money to see this team? Like, you can sell seats for Nerlens, Okafor, and even Sauce Castillo, but you can’t market any of these guys from Columbus. Plus, all of those 1st round picks… NOICE. I can’t believe I’m saying it, but I’d STILL rather have this roster… only to get swept as an 8th seed in the Eastern Conference.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGarbage Award\u003cbr/\u003e\u00091.\u0009Ty Lawson\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e\u00092.\u0009Jahlil Okafor\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e\u00093.\u0009Shabazz Muhammad\u2028\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: The Garbage Award goes to the worst NBA player that had a considerable amount of minutes played, whether he hid his garbageness underneath padded stats or he was a completely one-sided player\u0026ndash;and that side was hardly good anyway\u0026ndash;he was considered for this list. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eD: I think the biggest disappointment on this list was Ty Lawson. This guy only 3 years ago was the best player on a 57 win team, someone who ran the pick and roll beautifully and was a borderline all star. To see him play this poorly was jarring. Granted he did have problems with alcohol addiction, but he’s still fairly young at 27 and should only be reaching his prime. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: Yeah, this guy was like a really bad joke, I kind of feel bad for him because he really was a borderline star and now he’s the first winner of the ATL Garbage Award, what a fall-off. We both agreed on Okafor at 2, which is crazy when you look at his stats, you’d think he was a solid contributor to a\u0026hellip;well, terrible team, but he was crazy inefficient. Like ‘2006 Gnarls Barkley’ Crazy. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eD: I don’t really blame him for his offense, he shot okay on really difficult shots as the only real offensive threat on that team. It’s the total lack of defensive effort and discipline that has me really soured on him. Not only did he not try on that end, he did not care. And finally Shabazz Muhammad. I will admit, I have a personal bias towards him as a UCLA guy and I tried to find others that were worse, but I failed at that endeavor. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: (Sigh) I know, as a double-homer guy here\u0026ndash;UCLA and T-Wolves fan\u0026ndash;it’s tough to say that he had the worst Win-share percentage of any guy with 20+ minutes. His defense, like Okafor, is God-awful, and it’s not out of a lack of trying, he’s just really, really, really, really, bad at it. Also, he is a bit of a ball hog on offense, he’s a decent shooter and decent driver, and actually a good rebounder for his size, but he probably loses Win-shares because he puts up so many contested shots that don’t go in. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eD: I think this is a good list of varied and fun NBA awards that actually paint a nice picture of the season. I hope you had just as fun of a time reading these as we had coming up with them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: I did, #T-Wolves2017PlayoffBound.

    "title": "How Improv Has Made Me a Better Writer // UCLA Radio Comedy Op-ed",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By\u003c/i\u003e: Courtney Burness\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date \u003c/i\u003e: 05/08/16\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost people view improv as something narcissists do to get a quick laugh from an audience and boost their ego. While this is definitely true some of the time, good improv requires so much more thought and effort than just getting a quick laugh. Improv can benefit people mentally and emotionally in so many different ways; for me, it’s not only helped me get through hard transitions in my life, but has made me better in unexpected ways, including improving my screenwriting skills. Doing improv has not only taught me a lot about writing characters, but about the writing process overall.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith regard to characters, improv has taught me first and foremost to give your characters a philosophy. In an improv scene, no one should act a certain way “just because.” A dad shouldn’t be passive aggressive towards his son just because it’s funny for the audience to watch, he needs a reason why he’s acting that way. Otherwise, the scene will never progress past that point. It’s also taught me that you need a voice of reason. Scenes can’t just be crazy characters doing crazy things together. That’s a ticket for a one-way trip to confusion, and if it doesn’t make sense when performers act it out it definitely won’t make sense on paper. What it’s taught me most about characters is conflict. Improv scenes are boring if they’re just people agreeing with each other. Of course, the first thing you’re taught in improv is “yes, and” so this may seem contradictory. However, while you should accept the reality of the world that your partner has created, you can’t just agree with everything they suggest. That’s not interesting and it’s not funny. The same goes for writing. Characters need to have some tension or disagreement between each other, otherwise your story is of no interest to the audience. No one wants to watch people live perfect lives, it’s uninteresting and depressing for the rest of us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eThrough improv, I’ve learned to accept critique and welcome collaboration. There’s always something that can be better about an improv scene. If it’s a hilarious scene, it could probably benefit from heightening and exploring those fun moments even more. If a scene is technically “correct” but isn’t very funny, test out some walk-ons; there’s always a funnier thing. In improv scenes,  it’s never about one person. Even if you’re the one to initiate you have to be open to the fact that your ideas will change. You can’t plan an entire scene in your head before you start it and expect everything to go that way. You’ll just end up getting flustered when your scene partner makes a choice that doesn’t line up with what’s in your head. And the same goes for writing. You may have an idea in your head of a complete story, but when it comes down to writing and drafting and redrafting, you have to be willing and open for these things to change to make your story better. If you’re too stuck in your original idea, there\u0026rsquo;s no room for growth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, improv has taught me to have fun and not to think so hard. So many times when I write I come to roadblocks when my characters have to solve problems. Improv has taught me that you can find solutions in easy ways; not everything has to be complicated. Audiences won’t laugh if they’re confused at an improv show, and the same goes for a novel or a script.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, improv has done so much for me. It’s given me confidence when I meet new people, it’s been a way for me to get out of my own head and be someone other than myself for a few hours. And it’s improved my writing so much in ways that no book on screenwriting ever could.\u003c/p\u003e",

Whereas most fans had either camped out for tickets at local record stores or waited anxiously online for a chance to get tickets, I had a spontaneous opportunity at 9:30 A.M. on the day of the concert to purchase a ticket through a friend. I impulsively reached out, not knowing what I would get myself into.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Situated in Pomona at the Fox Theater, the pack-jammed line to get into the theater had formed an hour before the door would open. At the top of theater, the marquee stated: “Nothing to See Here. Keep Moving.” The stage was cluttered with instruments, specifically large analog synths lighted with red LED lights and various keyboards as people made their way towards the smoky pit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the surrounding lights had dimmed, each member had made their way into the stage individually, ending with James Murphy in his trademark blazer and scruffy grey hair. They opened with the thumping drumbeats from “Us Vs. Them” \u003ci\u003eon Sound of Silver\u003c/i\u003e, eventually shifting over to heavy synth-arranged sounds like “I Can Change” from \u003ci\u003eThis is Happening\u003c/i\u003e. The energy in the crowd was intense; nearly everyone in the pit was jumping to the vivacious music and chanting towards the band.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring a short water break, James Murphy referred to their 2010 show at the Fox and explained that they decided to have their revival show back again at the Fox because they had a good show in 2010. Oddly enough, the day also happened to fall upon James Murphy’s nephew’s birthday, who happened to be hidden somewhere in the audience. LCD Soundsystem brought a chaotic environment in “Yeah”, where I found myself surrounded by others screaming “yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah…,” and followed suit, furiously jumping into a sweaty mosh pit as I banged elbow to elbow with strangers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe set closed with “Home” and “New York, I Love You But You’re Bringing Me Down” as a blinding disco ball scattered the roof and walls of the theater. “New York” was triumphant and a high point of the concert that was concluded with a distorted jangly guitar solo. The band took a short break after, announcing previously that they would be back with an encore to finish their set. The lights brightened as the sweat-drenched audience shouted out cheers and applauded during the break.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe encore concluded with a trio of “Dance Yrself Clean”, “Yr City’s a Sucker” (a song only played at Pomona), and “All My Friends”. As the iconic piano from “All My Friends” endlessly built to a climax, the audience in the pit became hysterical as we fist pumped and sang the song lyric-by-lyric. Monochrome lights illuminated the stage as the band and audience sung out the chorus for the last time. Nostalgia of past experiences and past friends rushed in my memory like a bullet train as everyone echoed “where are your friends tonight”.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, LCD Soundsystem’s intimate revival from the dead in a 2000-person venue in Pomona for a monstrous two-and-a-half-hour set equated to an epic intimate party that I was honored to attend from one “stupid decision” I made to impulsively buy a concert ticket.\u003c/p\u003e",

The word translates to “struggle.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eGirlz With Gunz\u003c/i\u003e is fraught with references not just to the struggle of a nation’s liberation, but also the struggle of a single woman: Grace Maseva, a Zimbabwean resistance fighter who eventually died of AIDS. The album’s release comes with an essay by writer Charles Tonderai Mudede, tying the album’s themes with the history of Maseva. Chimurenga Renaissance is an effort of community. They recruited members of the art collective Black Constellation, using vocals from Sassy Black of future-R\u0026amp;B group THEESatisfaction, and singer JusMoni. Thematically, \u003ci\u003eGirlz With Gunz \u003c/i\u003eis an indictment of the pernicious effects of colonization and an ode to the power of womanhood. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough \u003ci\u003eGirlz With Gunz\u003c/i\u003e is a tapestry of musical influence, its sensibilities lie in the synthesis of African musical tradition with contemporary rap production. Maraire’s beat production follows the frenetic and jumbled rhythms of Zimbabwe’s Shona music, and momentary glints of the traditional Mbira instrument are present in the mix. Kalonji fills in with Congolese guitar melodies, adding texture to the ballistic clash of bass and drums. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn songs “Our Purpose Is Forever” and “Everything Comes Off Tonight” the vocal lines tread the line between the croon of soul/gospel music and the vocal projections of Shona tradition. The 27-minute project comes to its conclusion with the song “Girlz With Gunz.” The synthesis of influence seems to work best here, as Kalonji’s shining guitar bleeds over a swelling bassline and trap beats, spotted with tribal drums. Just as the music is informed by the spirit of fluidity in national identity, it frees itself from the bounds of genre. Chimurenga Renaissance seeks and finds a cohesive sound that celebrates black music’s roots, its contemporary moment, and its future liberation. \u003ci\u003eGirlz With Gunz\u003c/i\u003e can be streamed in full with accompanying visuals directed by Daniel Kaufman.\u003c/p\u003e",

At some point, I was completely numb to music festivals: they were all the same. Just copy and paste Coachella’s lineup to Lollapalooza, change Indio, CA to Chicago, IL.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSure there would be a handful of music festivals that were somewhat different: Sasquatch and Lightning in a Bottle — but in the end, these music festivals were trying to make money. There was no real heart in curation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut last year, my excitement for music festivals was reignited when I found out that Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon was teaming up with The National’s Aaron Dessner to create Eaux Claires, a music festival in Vernon’s hometown Eau Claire, Wisconsin. It was so evident that the festival wasn’t some ploy to get money, to sell some sort of teenage fantasy of girls is daisy dukes and flower crowns. Eaux Claires transcended the basic stereotypes of music festivals with a wholesome intent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI had extensively found out everything I could about this festival, mostly because my love for Justin Vernon grows and grows. Back in 2015, Vernon had stated that he didn’t have any definite plans in releasing music under Bon Iver anymore and that Eaux Claires might be the only place he’d perform under that name. However, Vernon recently did an \u003ca href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6874732/bon-iver-justin-vernon-eaux-claires-fest-wisconsin\" target=\"_blank\"\u003einterview with Billboard \u003c/a\u003estating that he’s been writing new music and will soon embark on a mini-Asia tour. Festival attendees can definitely expect Vernon to be playing some new music as Bon Iver, just as he did last year when he played two unreleased songs. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat struck me the most about this festival was it’s clear intent: to foster a community. While the lineup is indeed centered around folk artists, Vernon also tries to cultivate the Wisconsin and Minneapolis music scene. I’ve personally been a fan of the Minneapolis music scene for a while — and hopefully I’ll see Night Moves and Hippo Campus on the Eaux Claires lineup one day. Another aspect of the lineup that makes it so special is that it is curated by Vernon: he utilizes his resources to invite artists that he loves to listen to, like Senyawa, an Indonesian hardcore metal band.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, the whole Eaux Claires experience is different from other music fesitvals: Eaux Claires focuses on accentuating their location of rural Wisconsin. It’s everything the little folk lover inside of me could want — a weekend out in the wilderness filled with music and love. Vernon even commented how last year’s Eaux Claires was so heartwarming because the attendees were so enthusiastic and loving: “It felt like I was getting married and everyone was there and everyone was getting married to each other.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGoing through the 2016 lineup, I found some new artists that I’m excited to explore. I’ve mentioned a few that caught my attention but I’ve created a small sampler playlist that highlights only a portion of the talent Eaux Claires will be showcasing this year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEaux Claires 2016 includes: James Blake, Bon Iver, S. Carey, Lisa Hannigan, Aaron Dessner, The Staves, Unknown Mortal Orchestra, Vince Staples, My Brightest Diamond, Nathaniel Rateliff \u0026amp; The Night Sweats, Phil Cook, and Phosphorescent. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlison’s To-Watch List:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHar Mar Superstar\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJenny Lewis\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKill The Vultures\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLittle Scream\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLucius\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTenement\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTickle Torture\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTuskha\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWilliam Tyler\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026ndash;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpotify Playlist of Associated Artists:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3A1235570987%3Aplaylist%3A7CFWFU96IGJDN8PXpXIUTF\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/1SruB6x\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://bit.ly/1SruB6x\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "A Punchable Face // UCLA Radio News Op-ed",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By\u003c/i\u003e: Madeleine McComb, UCLA Radio DJ (02/07/16)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009A candidate’s likeability is a wholly subjective metric, the answer depending on whom you ask. Not so with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. Craig Maizin, the Senator’s roommate at Princeton, describes him as an “asshole” and a “cyborg” on Twitter, also claiming that the year they spent rooming together should earn him “reparations”. My (very liberal) mother likes to say he has a “punchable face”. The Senator’s colleagues in Washington are slightly more gracious; former House Speaker John Boehner publically refers to him as an “asshole”, and notoriously mum former President George W. Bush once told donors that he “just doesn’t like” his fellow Texan. Even conservative New York Times columnist David Brooks, a center right guy who typically waxes poetic about morality and civil discourse, took to his wildly popular column on January 12\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e to declare, “Cruz is a stranger to most of what would generally be considered the Christian virtues: humility, mercy, compassion and grace”. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009So why does everyone hate Ted Cruz? And, perhaps more importantly, why is he still polling so well in the national Republican primary? \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The Senator’s likeability – or lack thereof – is perhaps one major driving factor for his early support. According to an August poll conducted by the Associated Press, 77% of registered Republicans reported preferring a “Washington outsider” to someone with experience inside the beltway. Furthermore, in a field of true outsiders, people like Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina who have never held any elected office, Senator Cruz is familiar enough with the Washington bureaucracy to understand it, but distant enough – and disliked enough – to still appear unsullied. In a country where the approval rating of Congress is somewhere between cockroaches and traffic jams, being an outsider is nothing but upside. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Furthermore, his legislative record while in Washington is that of disruption and disarray. Senator Cruz proudly takes credit for shutting down the government in 2013 in an attempt to defund the Affordable Care Act, and came close to a similar scenario earlier this year over Planned Parenthood funding. His style of governance is puritanical, and thus aligns nicely with the far-right wing of the Republican Party, for whom compromise is a synonym for weakness. As Candidate Cruz attempts to appeal to the Tea Party and other members of the new Freedom Caucus coalition, his balance of elitist East Coast credos with unapologetic conservatism plays nicely among primary voters. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009That isn’t to say that likeability is no longer a factor in this or any other race. Any Republican candidate going against the Bush family, David Brooks, and other prominent components of the GOP establishment have an uphill battle to fight. Likeability might be a non-factor right now, as candidates crisscross a frigid Iowa, kissing babies and begging for votes. But anyone with such a face as “punchable” as Ted Cruz’s will likely have to address these problems eventually – after all, it was one sweaty brow that killed Nixon in 1960. In the age of television, addressing one’s likeability problems is an inevitability. But maybe Senator Cruz will have the last laugh; he himself said that he has a “face for radio” – and, really, how bad could that be?  \u003c/p\u003e",

In the year 1908, Teddy Roosevelt was President of the United States, America had not yet fought in a World War, and the Titanic was still four years away from sinking. Many of our great grandparents had not yet born, and Major League Baseball was still in its infancy. Yet 1908 is most significant in sports for that year’s World Series, as the Chicago Cubs defeated the Detroit Tigers in five games for their second consecutive championship. Cubs fans had every reason to celebrate, with a dynasty on the horizon. Today, it is 2016, and in the past 108 years, the Cubs have not found themselves hoisting the Commissioner’s Trophy since 1908. Yet have no fear Southsiders \u0026ndash; the curse of the Billy Goat will soon come to the end, and the Chicago Cubs will be your 2016 World Series champions. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009To see why the Cubs have turned the baseball world on its heads and are on the cusp of glory, look no further than their front office and managerial positions.

Along with General Manager Jed Hoyer, Epstein has made a series of strong trades while running the Cubs, trading for All Star first baseman Anthony Rizzo in 2012, defensive whiz Addison Russell in 2014, and the reigning Cy Young award winner Jake Arrieta at the 2013 trade deadline. Coupled with the free agent signings of his ace in Boston John Lester, as well as perennial Gold Glove winner Jason Heyward this past offseason, Epstein has brilliantly blended youth with veteran talent to put the Cubs in a position to compete for years to come. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Widely regarded as one of the smartest minds in baseball, and one of its craftiest executives, Epstein’s biggest coup may have been in the 2014 offseason, when he was able to lure Joe Maddon away from the Tampa Bay Rays to become the new manager of the Cubs. In Tampa, Maddon inherited a young team and a franchise that had yet to experience a winning record. Undaunted, he changed the culture in Tampa, keeping his players loose, winning the 2008 AL Pennant and reaching the playoffs four times despite a revolving door of players due to payroll constraints. Maddon took over a 73 win team and promptly lead the Cubs to 97 wins and a spot in the NLCS, wining his third Manager of the Year award in the process. With Maddon at the helm, the Cubs will be led by one of baseball’s strongest and strategically crafty managers, ensuring clubhouse stability and leadership going forward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009From top to bottom, the Cubs may have the strongest and deepest line-up of any team in baseball. Starting in the infield, Miguel Montero anchors the team from behind the plate, while second year shortstop Addison Russell will look to improve upon his strong rookie season by seasoning his bat in combination with his defensive skills. At second base is likely leadoff hitter Ben Zobrist, who signed a four-year, 56 million-dollar free agent contract with the Cubs after winning the World Series with the Royals. A former All Star for Maddon in Tampa Bay, Zobrist is revered for his versatility.  He has averaged 5.6 WAR since becoming a regular in 2009, making him one of baseball’s most valuable all around players. At first base is 2015 All Star Anthony Rizzo, who out of the three hole blossomed into a legitimate MVP candidate by hitting 30 home runs and driving in 101 runs in 2015. Out of the cleanup spot is 2015 NL All Star and Rookie of the Year Kris Bryant, who lived up to his status as a consensus top prospect in baseball by busting onto the scene with 26 home runs and 99 RBIs. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The Cubs’ depth continues in the outfield, with three prolific hitters projected to start. After signing an eight-year, 184 million-dollar deal with the Cubs, Jason Heyward will operate out of the two spot. A three-time Gold Glove winner, Heyward will slide over to center field to replace Dexter Fowler and provide much needed defensive stability to the Cubs outfield, while also bringing his rare blend of power, speed, and ability to hit to for average to Wrigley Field. In the corner outfield positions are young outfielders Kyle Schwarber and Jorge Soler.  Despite struggling with breaking balls and injuries, Soler is still only 23 years old, giving him plenty of time to develop into the superstar status that was predicted of him upon defecting from Cuba. Often overshadowed by Bryant, Schwarber hit 16 home runs in only 232 at bats during his rookie year, rapidly making the jump to the Major Leagues after being drafted fourth in the 2014 draft out of Indiana. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Leading the Cubs rotation is the big three of Jake Arrieta, John Lester, and John Lackey. Arrieta was historically dominant in the second half of the 2015 season on his way to the Cy Young Award. As the ace of the Cubs, Arietta is coming off a season that saw him throw a no-hitter, win 22 games, finish with 236 strikeouts and a freakishly low 1.77 ERA and .0865 WHIP, and the baseball lead in complete games and shutouts, which does not include his shutout of the Pittsburgh Pirates in the wild card game. Behind Arrieta is veteran John Lester, who after signing a big free agent contract with the Cubs, struck out 207 batters with a 3.34 ERA, providing stability to the Cubs rotation and providing the team with leadership and a postseason pedigree. Rounding out the three-headed monster is Lester’s former teammate John Lackey, who joined the Cubs on a two year, 32 million-dollar contract at the expense of the Cubs division rival, the St. Louis Cardinals.  Despite turning 36 years old, 2015 marked what may have been Lackey’s finest season as a pro, as he combined 13 wins with a 2.77 ERA, while beating the Cubs with 7.1 scoreless innings in the Game 1 of the NLDS. With 20 postseason starts to his resume, Lackey will provide the Cubs with valuable postseason experience as they look to make a deep run on their way to the World Series. Jason Hammel and Kyle Hendricks, both valuable veteran starters in their own right, complete the rotation. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Something that Maddon has traditionally thrived with is a deep, strong bullpen, and the Cubs are no exception. Acquired alongside Jake Arrieta, Pedro Strop pitched to a 2.91 ERA in 76 appearances, while Justin Grimm produced a sparkling 1.99 ERA in 62 games. In his first full year as closer, Hector Rondon converted 30 saves with a 1.67 ERA, developing into one of the more consistent closers in baseball. Yet the real x-factor of the Cubs’ bullpen are former starters Trevor Cahill and the newly acquired Adam Warren, as both bring a bevy of pitches and can provide the Cubs with valuable innings should their rotation falter. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Although the Cubs came up a little bit short in 2015 despite the prediction of the film “Back to the Future,” the future is brighter than ever in Chicago. With as balanced a team as any in baseball, it appears that the wait may soon be over for Cubs fans, that the streak will come to an end at 108 years, and generations of Cubs fans will rejoice in the streets to celebrate their World Series champions.\u003c/p\u003e",

Regina designs each week’s playlist and discussion grounded on ideas and topics about female musicians. It is also some of the most fun you can have tuning into a UCLA Radio show as some of the tracks that you hear are beautifully hand-picked gems that Regina throws into weekly sets that leave you dancing in your living room, headbanging in the shower, spacing out and/or crying to melancholic and heartbreaking lyrics, and much much more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to having a very thoughtful, eclectic playlist of songs made by female musicians (and non-binary musicians on occasion), there are a lot of very interesting and important talk that happens in between sets of songs from reading off quotes from great feminists and activists such as Roxane Gay and Angela Davis to fun facts about the female artists she plays during her show. It’s rad as hell.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, we might be a little into January already, but as the station has been gearing up for Winter Applications which are due on \u003cb\u003eJanuary 11th at 11:59pm (this upcoming Monday)\u003c/b\u003e, we wanted to remind everyone via our social media that applications are still being accepted until then!

Cole and Kendrick Lamar. (anticipating their new album in February possibly?) But just as important, if not more, Ms. Badu dropped her anticipated mixtape, \u0026ldquo;But You Caint Use My Phone\u0026rdquo; at exactly 12 o'clockthat Friday morning. I\u0026rsquo;m going to be honest and say that I haven\u0026rsquo;t digitally bought an album in YEARS. With new free music streaming on Soundcloud constantly, streaming apps like Spotify and Apple Music, and radio apps like Songza and Pandora, buying music isn\u0026rsquo;t really necessary anymore. That might be changing though, with artists not releasing on any streaming sites, or even waiting to release til they hit a certain number of pre-orders (Jay Rock\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;90059\u0026rdquo;). That\u0026rsquo;s another post though. Regardless, I bought my godmomma\u0026rsquo;s mixtape today and I\u0026rsquo;m going to break down and review her gift right here. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1. \u0026ldquo;Caint Use My Phone (Suite)\u0026rdquo;\u003cbr/\u003eBadu stays true to theme and makes sure you\u0026rsquo;re not confused on the subject of the album with ringtones and communication methods throughout the first track. (You betta use telepathy/Put a message in a bottle/You betta use Morse code/Get a towel and some smoke\u0026hellip;) She also makes sure that you recognize the source of the name of the album, with sampling of her infamous \u0026lsquo;97 track \u0026ldquo;Tyrone\u0026rdquo;, which is not only self-produced, but has the help of Zach Witness. He hails from the same stomping grounds as Badu, Dallas, TX, but also did an amazing remix of \u0026ldquo;Bag Lady\u0026rdquo; earlier this year. He pops up again helping on tracks like, \u0026ldquo;Phone Down\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll Call U Back\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Dial'Afreaq\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;Medley\u0026rdquo;. (Basically half the album)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e2. \u0026ldquo;Hi\u0026rdquo;\u003cbr/\u003eThe next track works as an interlude into \u0026ldquo;Cel U Lar Device\u0026rdquo; (or the \u0026ldquo;Hotline Bling Remix\u0026rdquo; as we know it) clocking in at only 36 secs, but it also introduces the sounds of the ending track with Andre 3k, \u0026ldquo;Hello\u0026rdquo;. Once again, some self-production with the help of T. RUNDGREN, an instrumentalist from the 80\u0026rsquo;s.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e3. \u0026ldquo;Cel U Lar Device\u0026rdquo;\u003cbr/\u003eNot much review on this one considering its the track we all fell in love with and what started this whole album, the \u0026ldquo;Hotling Bling Remix\u0026rdquo;. Drake apparently helped her with the production on this one, which isn\u0026rsquo;t surprising, but was D.R.A.M. asked too? (Educate yourself on the \u0026ldquo;Cha-Cha\u0026rdquo;/\u0026ldquo;Hotline Bling\u0026rdquo; sampling issue.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e4. \u0026ldquo;Phone Down\u0026rdquo;\u003cbr/\u003eAnother single off the album, in my top 3, \u0026ldquo;Phone Down\u0026rdquo; I actually feel has the exact amount of Badu\u0026rsquo;s trademark sound while weaving this generation\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;wavey rap\u0026rdquo; perfectly. Sounds like an OVO sound without the crying, partying, and heartbreak dripped lyrics. (On the topic of lyrics, every bit of this I want to sing to every guy I\u0026rsquo;m ever involved with. Haha.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e5. \u0026ldquo;U Use to Call Me feat. Drake\u0026rdquo;\u003cbr/\u003eThe first physical appearance of Drake on the album. He gets a full interlude to himself, except for the background sampling of the earlier song, \u0026ldquo;Cel U Lar Device\u0026rdquo;. Nice minute interlude though.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e6. \u0026ldquo;Mr. Telephone Man\u0026rdquo;\u003cbr/\u003eIn case you missed it, we\u0026rsquo;re all about education on this blog so if you don\u0026rsquo;t recognize the song title or sampling, you didn\u0026rsquo;t listen closely enough to your mama when she was playing her oldies. The song references and samples are almost word for word, New Edition\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Mr. Telephone Man\u0026rdquo;. Even better, the original producer for the single, Ray Parker Jr., produced this as well. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t do much lyrically for the album, but it\u0026rsquo;s still a smooth song. They all should be though, Erykah used every tool possible to make sure the frequencies on this album were as comforting as she could make it. Science, people. Science. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e7. \u0026ldquo;U Don\u0026rsquo;t Have to Call\u0026rdquo;\u003cbr/\u003eI don\u0026rsquo;t know what it is about Usher\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;U Don\u0026rsquo;t Have to Call\u0026rdquo;, but everyone wants to remake it. Last year it was Childish Gambino\u0026rsquo;s on \u0026ldquo;STN MTN\u0026rdquo;. Domo Genesis recently sung it at Camp Flog Gnaw this year. Now Erykah wants a turn at it, at least she adds her own verse though. (What planet did you come from boy/I know that we just met homeboy/comin\u0026rsquo; for my lovin\u0026rsquo; oh boy) This is the first reference to her using the word \u0026ldquo;squirrel\u0026rdquo; as a pet name too, she does it again in \u0026ldquo;Hello\u0026rdquo; while talking to Andre. She also makes it her own with the amazing production of Pharrell at hand on the track.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e8. \u0026ldquo;Medley: What\u0026rsquo;s Yo Phone Number / Telephone (Ghost of Screw Mix) feat. Drake\u0026rdquo;\u003cbr/\u003eThe second longest song on the album, another one of my favorites, and one of the most surprising when looking at the producers of the track. (Artists start making liner notes somewhere on your albums again!) Turns out that her oldest, Seven Benjamin, does the production for this one. Keep in mind that this son is the offspring of Erykah Badu and Andre 3000, which explains the talent. Drake does another feature, as well as there being a subtle remix to her track \u0026ldquo;Telephone\u0026rdquo; to end the song. Once again, my favorite. Five minutes isn\u0026rsquo;t long enough.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e9. \u0026ldquo;Dial'Afreaq\u0026rdquo;\u003cbr/\u003eOkayyyy, here\u0026rsquo;s the explanation to all the bees on the cover. (More education, I told ya\u0026rsquo;ll we\u0026rsquo;re about that here.) So apparently, bees use the Earth\u0026rsquo;s magnetic field as a compass to fly. Since cell phones\u0026rsquo; signals and frequencies are messing that force up, the bees fly erratically or as \u0026ldquo;Badu-Tron\u0026rdquo; puts it \u0026ldquo;making it impossible for them hoes to find their way back to the hive\u0026rdquo;. This results in the huge decline in the bee population ever since the popularity in cell phones has risen. Without bees there\u0026rsquo;s no pollination. No pollination, means things can\u0026rsquo;t grow. Things can\u0026rsquo;t grow, then it\u0026rsquo;s all around bad for us. So be nice to a bee today, they have it hard. Lesson over. This one\u0026rsquo;s the funniest off the album, I don\u0026rsquo;t think Badu meant for this one to be a favorite on the work. It has tons of early Funkadelic on it for sure though.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e10. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll Call U Back\u0026rdquo;\u003cbr/\u003eThis one starts off with the same intro as her \u0026ldquo;Hotline Bling Remix\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Cel U Lar Device\u0026rdquo;, but is way more R\u0026amp;B influenced. Not only that, but Erykah has definitely been paying attention to Hip Hop lately with a major flow sampling from Post Malone\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;White Iverson\u0026rdquo;. One of the smoothest tracks on the album as she reminds ya\u0026rsquo;ll, business is first and I\u0026rsquo;ll call you after.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e11. \u0026ldquo;Hello feat. Andre 3000\u0026rdquo;\u003cbr/\u003eYes, I know you all have been waiting for this one since I mentioned 3000\u0026rsquo;s appearance on the album period. We all know Andre allows us one fire feature a year and then slips back into whatever other universe he actually lives in for another 3k-less year. This time the infamous couple/not-a-couple team up for the unanimous best song on the piece. Proving that they always should\u0026rsquo;ve gotten married and been #RelationshipGoals for all of us Carefree People of Color looking for more than bae in this world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNonetheless, the song is nothing but a dream throughout, mostly with a lot Andre leading the lyrics. He challenges us to walk out of the room with our phones unlocked, and right side up (which we all know is the biggest trust exercise there is). As well as, thinking out loud on his insecurities, waiting to see if his woman will answer his call. The pet name, \u0026ldquo;squirrel\u0026rdquo;, comes up again, but no explanation as to why. Nothing, but love and positive frequencies to end the album though. Sorry, I can\u0026rsquo;t give you more without ruining the effect for you all when you listen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinal thoughts? Go out and get the album! Best $7.99 I ever spent. I regret nothing. If it comes out on vinyl, I\u0026rsquo;ll buy that too. But she\u0026rsquo;s my godmomma so it would be wrong if I didn\u0026rsquo;t anyway\u0026hellip;\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWords By:\u003c/i\u003e Kelsee Thomas\u003c/p\u003e",

We are living in a dark chapter of American history. “It isn’t a good time right now,” is no longer just something you tell your friend when he calls you in the middle of your masturbation session. Instead, it has become a fitting summary of the world around us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn times as bleak as this, we all need our personal escapes. For some, the escape comes in the form of a pill. For others, the escape comes in the form of a new hobby. For me, the escape comes in the form of memoirs of women who’ve moved to France.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI can’t recall which book first opened my eyes - was it \u003ci\u003eBlossoming In Provence\u003c/i\u003e, or \u003ci\u003eSeven Letters From France\u003c/i\u003e, or \u003ci\u003ePicnic in Provence: A Memoir With Recipes\u003c/i\u003e? It doesn’t matter, as the titles are unimportant. It’s the arc of the story, the hero’s journey, as set in rural (or nonrural) France. The words slide off the page, blending into a warm, soothing bath of shoes, delicious food, and worrying about weight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009There are two types of these books. One type is the straight up memoir, simply a woman telling us what it was like to drop everything and move to France! The other is the combination book, a book that is maybe both a memoir and a cookbook, or maybe it’s \u003ci\u003eBringing Up Bebe: One American Mother Discovers the Wisdom of French Parenting\u003c/i\u003e: a book that is part memoir, part parenting guide. It joins the likes of \u003ci\u003eFrench Kids Eat Everything\u003c/i\u003e (which claims to be “At once a memoir, a cookbook, a how-to handbook, and a delightful exploration of how the French manage to feed children without endless battles and struggles with pickiness”) and \u003ci\u003eBebe Day by Day\u003c/i\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009But no matter whether the author has enough material to fill out a whole book, or whether she needs to pad it out with supplemental material (I’m waiting for one with a crossword), the most compelling thing about these books, the thing that makes me go to them when I need to escape, is not the tales within them. Like a written version of jazz, it’s more about what’s not written.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Moving to France is not cheap. A one way flight will run you around 600 dollars, and that’s before you check a bag, or buy one of those snack baskets with a little tupperware of grapes and some cheese. Once you’ve landed, you better have a nice nest egg with which you can find a place to live, or else you’ll be out on the street with all the mimes who never made it big.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009I say all this to say that if you can move to France, you probably don’t have many real problems (at least financially or socially). A survey of these memoirs bears that out. The protagonist is inevitably a well-off white woman, for whom the height of day-to-day struggle is a broken heel at a rustic farm-to-table dinner. If that sounds trite, bear in mind it’s a real anecdote from \u003ci\u003eTout Sweet\u003c/i\u003e. This is what is not written in the books. What are inconveniences to us are major crises to them. The appeal, then, is to in inhabit someone for whom rock bottom is the local baker not returning your flirting glances.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009I am a college student. If I can make through the next four years, I’ll be walloped with an incredible amount of debt, thrown into an economy where wealth inequality is the highest it’s been since the roaring 20′s. But that identity slips away when I sink into the first-person prose of one of these books. Instead, I’m touring France with Karen in \u003ci\u003eTout Sweet\u003c/i\u003e, metaphorically clutching the back of her Vespa. I cheer as she falls in love with the antiques dealer, and hiss with anger when she finds out he’s married, never wondering how she can afford to spend so much money on finding herself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile these books are marketed as memoirs, they’re more like fantasy. Or, more accurately, it’s like if Narnia released a tourism brochure. I’ll never drop everything and move to France. I don’t have enough money to “wave good-bye to [my] glamorous city lifestyle to go it alone in a run-down house in rural Poitou-Charentes, central western France.” I’m stuck with my decidedly unglamorous city lifestyle. But when I crack the spine of \u003ci\u003eTout Sweet\u003c/i\u003e or \u003ci\u003eBlossoming In Provence\u003c/i\u003e, I don’t have to be. For such an escape, $10.16 on Amazon seems like a small price to pay.\u003c/p\u003e",

The piercing screams of the mostly-female crowd rivaled that of a One Direction concert. The amount of estrogen that permeated through the air almost condensed into a tangible cloud of teenage hysteria. When Jesse Rutherford finally leaped onto the stage, it wasn’t hard to understand why. From his bleached blonde hair to his glitter eye shadow, he looked as if he could be a living, breathing renaissance painting, a perfect cross between Sting and Billy Idol, appearing on stage with a halo of blue light as if to present his divinity to the audience. Standing perfectly still, his hand delicately placed over his heart, staring piously into heavens only he could see, Jesse was a perfect being. Almost out of nowhere, he dives into “Born to Be Blonde,” and the audience surrenders to him completely. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f57eb2d22098dd914f055d5d3f3d73bb/tumblr_inline_p1qy18RwG11qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbout halfway into Jesse’s set, eight shadowy figures emerged from the audience and jumped onto the stage, as the opening bars of “GOLD” signified the arrival of BROCKHAMPTON. Whatever sense of chill the crowd had left by that point was gone. I can’t even recall what happened during this time because the entire audience basically became a giant mosh pit. No one could have predicted BROCKHAMPTON’s unexpected appearance, but it was somehow a perfect compliment to Jesse’s androgynous style. Without warning, they finished their last song and jumped off the stage back into the swirling vortex of bodies and disappeared as quickly as they came. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dea0f6e5d327c7ebc1f183452fc478f5/tumblr_inline_p1qy95pmG81qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe sheer visual smorgasbord of Jesse’s performance rendered the music almost pointless. His outfit changes alone were enough to carry an entire show, ranging from a perfectly tailored suit to a red 49ers tee, even to the extreme of boxers and bondage attire. His movements shifted with each new costume, ranging from sensuously caressing himself, to grabbing his crotch, to rolling around onstage in a fetal position. It was as if he was determined to display the entire range of human emotion onstage. Visually, Jesse is a work of biological art, and the show he put on was a visceral piece of performance art. Jesse himself is known for his mercurial periods of different personas, and his performance reflected multi-faceted quintessence of who he is. That night, Jesse was every version of himself that within his one body. One moment, he was a sensitive boi crooning to the audience with a guitar, the next he was thrashing a microphone around his naked torso in a fit of dangerous manic energy and a flash of diamond grills, then rolling around on the floor losing himself in his own melancholy. He was drunk off his own ego, and the crowd was equally intoxicated. Everyone in the audience wanted to touch him, to feel the raw sexuality that sublimated off his skin. At many points throughout the show, he leaned into the crowd to bless them with a fleeting chance to caress his stomach or his hands or his face. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1d65ac11224f52e9aceab906182f5e2d/tumblr_inline_p1qy3r6XzU1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis last outfit of the night featured his classic black leather jacket that marked his distinct style since the formation of The Neighbourhood. It was almost his way of saying that no matter how many times his identity shifted, he would always be Jesse of The Neighbourhood, which was a perfect way to end his very first solo show without them.\u003c/p\u003e",

The atmosphere ended up complementing the artist quite well; like the disco ball that spun above his head, Baio’s electropop was dance-inducing, and like the plastic tangerine-hued chairs to the side, his live performance was charmingly quirky.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVancouver-based Teen Daze opened the evening by DJing.  As concertgoers situated themselves at the bar or on those orange seats off to the side, Teen Daze’s soft electronic picks filled in the gaps between conversations, rather than overtake them. Before exiting the stage, he commented that Los Angeles was his favorite city - a pleasant, unpretentious sentiment to end his pleasant, unpretentious set.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBaio quickly took over the stage, donning a dark suit and accompanied by similarly dapper George Hume on guitar.  Launching into “Needs” from his first album The Names, the pair injected preppy pep into the small crowd that had gathered at Zebulon’s dance floor.  Baio, known for his \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/QN1QGeaZnTY\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eunquestionably hip dancing\u003c/a\u003e at Vampire Weekend concerts, was no longer tethered to his bass guitar and was able to show off a few of his adorkably groovy moves when he grabbed the mic and let loose in the front of the stage. Sadly, these delightful moments were somewhat limited, as Baio often retreated back to playing behind his mixer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D_km_LvnII6M%26feature%3Dyoutu.be\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_km_LvnII6M?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdding to the on-stage entertainment, Baio also incorporated projections as background visuals during his set.  Most memorable of them was the \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/_km_LvnII6M\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e“Man of the World” music video\u003c/a\u003e that played along with the song’s live performance, in which different Baios clad in white tuxes shimmy at the Palace of Versailles, read The New York Times at Grand Central Terminal, or fly up Burj Khalifa behind the artist singing in real life.  With this set-up, however, there was little room for spontaneity during songs, as Baio and Hume had to perform in time with the projections behind them.  Nevertheless, the duo delivered a spirited yet intimate act full of tracks mostly pulled from the artist’s latest album \u003ci\u003eMan of the World. \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOther highlights were the ultra-catchy “PHILOSOPHY!,” anxiety-ridden “DANGEROUE ANAMAL,” the seamless transition between the purely electronic “Sunburn Modern” into the bubbly “Sister of Pearl,” and the punchy and playful “The Key Is Under The Mat.”  Throughout the set, Baio was the paragon of a “cool nerd,” from bopping to his beats at his mixer while sporting a mustard yellow bowtie, to crooning in a David Bowie-esque, syrupy baritone while lamenting about climate change and being a sensitive guy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1365\" data-orig-width=\"962\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/98de78f0dbc1a14368f84f2acd785efd/tumblr_inline_p09fvxynkH1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1365\" data-orig-width=\"962\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Endless Rhythm” wrapped up the synthpop-filled evening at a sensible 9:00.  The prudent concertgoers dispersed from the dance floor, most leaving to go home and a few sticking around to chat with Hume packing up the equipment, or with \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/therealCT1\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eanother VW member\u003c/a\u003e who had shown up to support his friend.  \u003c/p\u003e",

Recognized first for her songwriting, she has collaborated on songs for artists including Beyonce, Usher, and Skrillex. Recently, NSTASIA completed and dropped a solo album that has already gained some critical acclaim, and has her in hot demand for collaborations with major artists.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNSTASIA performed at a brand new underground speakeasy in Los Angeles last Thursday,  11/16, the same night she dropped her album \u003ci\u003eNew Religion\u003c/i\u003e. The venue itself was understated from the outside, a warehouse that blends easily into the landscape of east Los Angeles. The only sign of the party inside was the faint blue neon light cast onto the pavement, along with a hum of laughter and chatter from inside, and the small cluster of people at the door. Upon entering the party, we are greeted with a small art gallery and a clustering of excited people, NSTASIA mingling among them. The gallery itself was made up of album art, all fresh and bright, mirroring NSTASIA’s sound. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDownstairs we find a sleek speakeasy, with leather couches and chairs, and bartenders serving up a variety of palatable whiskey-based drinks. The crowd moves its way down, and there is a last rush for the bar before NSTASIA takes the stage, anticipatory murmurs and the occasional shout of laughter the last sounds before she begins to sing. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNSTASIA launches right into her first song, “Trap or Die,” the most popular off her album. She has an ethereal presence on stage, singing the soulful melody with a gleaming smile and effortless connection to her accompanying band. She is clearly influenced by other women in her genre, including SZA, Rihanna, Beyonce, The Internet, but her sound is unique, a little bit more country, perhaps informed by her earlier experimentation in the genre. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNSTASIA’s music is a little bit mournful, but empowered; she sings of troubled relationships, but with a love and affection that is palpable. NSTASIA continues with more electro-R\u0026amp;B songs such as “Hell of A Time,” and “Parachute,” and the audience bops along — it’s impossible not to.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNSTASIA grew up with music, and that’s apparent in her technical skill. There’s something else about her that distinguishes her from the technically skillful, and I have a hard time pinpointing it during her performance. Around the last song, I realize: it’s the joy that emanates from her performance and through her music, the bright neon of her album art realized in sound. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter a brief set, just six songs, NSTASIA thanks us profusely, and tells us to drink and celebrate, joining the mingling crowd. Keep an eye out for her in the coming months — with her voice, talent, and friendly charisma, she’ll be impossible to miss. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhoto Credit: EAST\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

I was reading George Orwell, not the overplayed 1984, but Burmese Days, something with relatively no standing in the literary world; something about the fragrance of frangipani trees. It reminded me of home in Arizona where the creosote illuminates the desert with fragrance after a monsoon rain. That means something to me. It evoked feelings of nostalgia of home and all of the beautiful rainy days, friends of the past and so on. That’s when I googled the word and found out about its “reminiscent” characteristics as well. I equated the two definitions as meaning the evocation of emotion through nostalgia, which is exactly what I want to do with my show. Instead of fragrance, however, my show focuses on sound. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eYou mention in your show description that “it has been hard for [you] to enjoy immediacy.” Why is living in the moment a challenge for you?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is a difficult question for me because I truly have no idea why it has been hard for me to enjoy immediacy. Something just feels a bit off, like I’m too self-aware. Recently, I’ve been very within myself, adding an element of analysis to a situation that needs no interpretation. I suppose it’s almost as if I’m focused on the act of being in the present, rather than being in the present. To be in the present requires no means, it just requires being. Although recording everyday situations seems paradoxical to actually engaging with the present, I don’t create the moments with my field recorder. The moments in which I am truly present happen on their own, and I simply use the field recorder to capture them and ultimately engage with them further in my show. Capturing everyday audio as a medium of expression of my present being allows me to quite literally capture my moments of immediacy and share them with everyone. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow does “Redolence” enhance listeners’ (and your own) ability to be emotionally present and thoughtful?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wouldn’t say it helps anyone else be thoughtful, or emotionally present. In this regard, the show is really based on a selfish concept. However, I’ve always thought art to find merit in its ability to express a piece of the artist’s self. I am simply trying to share a sincere moments of my life. Therefore, it doesn’t enhance listeners’ ability to be emotionally present and thoughtful, but rather to share in my life. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI had a close friend of mine approach me with regards to the show. Following the traditional stand on ceremony, she asked what it’s about. This was difficult to explain. All I can say in the case of “Redolence” is that it is a direct way to share a part of myself with the world, the listeners. In addition to quite literally recording bits and pieces of my life, I hope that with the placement and editing of audio and musical/literary accompaniment that these moments feel to you as they felt to me. I hope that even if slightly, you get to feel a little of what I felt and choose to continue following me on my journey!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow does confronting emotional experiences in the present moment differ from reflecting on past emotional experiences?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eConfronting emotional experiences in the present is a rather passive event in terms of conscious thought. You’re there, something happens, you smile, maybe, but it’s over as soon as it starts. Maybe you reflect, but the beauty of it is in its happening and your unconscious response. Reflecting on past emotional experiences, however, allows me to consciously interpret the unconscious experience of immediacy. To interact with the experience in different ways and in a different mindset. I haven’t figured out if this is damaging or helpful yet, but I’m definitely experimenting! \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat is one thing that people should know about you, your show, or both?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI hope to exude an air of vulnerability that displays my passion in every episode of “Redolence.” More importantly, though, on November 3, 2017, I will be the proud owner of a cowboy hat. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"416\" data-orig-width=\"1135\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e916dd216122028db0622754d3784c2a/tumblr_inline_ozfonmFfuD1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"416\" data-orig-width=\"1135\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

Both EPs were made in a very DIY way, on a laptop, in bedrooms, having minimal resources. I made them both within a month as well, while the album was more or less a work in progress for almost two years. I was able to learn a lot more about recording and production and just figuring out what I wanted with this album, since I had the experience of playing live and touring, and releasing stuff publicly. Sonically it\u0026rsquo;s different too in that I wanted it to have a much bigger range of styles and genre within it than I\u0026rsquo;d had a chance to display on the EPs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow did your time at Berklee shape you as a musician?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m not really sure, to be honest. I learned a lot in terms of getting to understand music on a more theoretical level, because I had zero knowledge of music theory before going there. But as a writer or creator, I think being at school for music, it just allowed me to make music my main focus for a while and gave me the space to start writing and recording more and figuring out my sound on my own.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHave you collaborated with any of your former peers?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot yet, but there are so many talented musicians I went to school with that I\u0026rsquo;m always talking to about doing something together\u0026hellip;soon hopefully. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhich interlude is your favorite on \u003ci\u003eCrawl Space\u003c/i\u003e and why?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think “Bad Girl” is my favorite, because it kind of tracks this very quick switch from the self doubt and insecurity of thinking I was a bad singer to this kind of empowered, confident spin on it where I say, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m the hell of a bad girl.\u0026rdquo; I can relate to those two mentalities and the duality of those emotions that I still experience all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eIs the little girl on way to record you? \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYes, that\u0026rsquo;s me on all of the interludes.

I don\u0026rsquo;t think there is a super direct influence that I can trace, but overall just having grown up in a lot of different places, different environments and cultures and being in a culturally eclectic household made it so that I was exposed to a lot of different music and diverse influences. So all of that definitely influences the kind of music I make.\u003c/p\u003e",

However, my festival attendance has taken a major hit over the past several years. There is a simple reason for this: ArcTanGent Festival. It\u0026rsquo;s simply the best festival on so many fronts and if you have a love for mathy/prog/experimental/good music, there\u0026rsquo;s nowhere else you should be. Every August, 5,000 fans from all over the world congregate on a farm just outside of Bristol in the UK for three days of glamping, stellar performances, and the best pad thai on the planet. I\u0026rsquo;m fortunate enough to have been part of that group for the past two summers and as a result I just can\u0026rsquo;t bring myself to shell out hundreds of dollars to eat nothing but popcorn while watching merely adequate bands and trying to avoid getting whacked by selfie sticks in the mosh pit. Anyone who knows me knows that I’m a fan of efficiency and killing as many stones with as few birds as possible. So once I noticed that a disproportionate number of the bands I was featuring in my festival recap had also released new music this year, I jumped at the opportunity to lessen the inevitable burden of what is certain to be a loaded “Best of 2017” wrap-up and get a head start on spotlighting some of this year’s most exciting releases. The ability of a band to excel both in recording and live performance may be an anomaly to some, but it is a testament to the organizers of ArcTanGent that they are able to consistently put together such quality lineups and find the bands who are just as stunning in the studio as they are on the stage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e5) tricot\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs with every “top” list that I make, I must open by reiterating my belief that rankings are arbitrary, counterproductive, and serve little purpose aside from aesthetics. This has been a spectacular year for music, as was exhibited at ArcTanGent and especially at these five bands’ sets. I’m not listing tricot at number five because they are on a lesser level than any of these other bands. I’m doing it because I can’t go much further into this piece without talking about how incredible their performance was. This being my second time at the festival, I knew that it was intrinsic in the ArcTanGent experience to encounter bands that absolutely blow you away. However, that still didn’t prepare me for tricot’s set. Watching the unbridled fervor of their performance, I felt like I was witnessing lightning in a bottle - the coming together of energy and musicianship, heightened by the adoration of the live audience, in a way that could only be experienced in a festival setting. And yet, it is the same level of thrill that I feel every time I listen to 3, the band’s new album which dropped this past May. With this album, the band has managed to capture the same balance of unrelenting aggression and unwavering grace which they have mastered through years of touring the world together. Of the five bands featured in this piece, tricot is the only one with vocals, which is indicative of the larger struggle many musicians in math rock face when trying to fit vocals into the already complex web of intricacies within the instrumental parts. Listening to tracks like “Tokyo Vampire Hotel,” you would never know that this struggle exists. The vocals are impeccably integrated into the music without ever feeling stretched or strained in accommodation to the other instruments. Japan has long been known for having one of the most loaded math rock scenes in the world, and with their hard-hitting live shows and the completion of their third album, tricot is rising to the levels of LITE and toe as essential bands for anyone looking to kickstart their exploration into the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-height=\"1067\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a3114b8c11b146cc9dfe28d44cbde234/tumblr_inline_oz4247zc071qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1600\" data-orig-height=\"1067\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhoto Credit: Jonathan Dadds\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e4) The Physics House Band\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen discussing five acts that have all produced such stellar music, it is easy to fall into cliches. I can say with certainty that The Physics House Band’s second album, Mercury Fountain, was one of my most highly anticipated releases in recent memory, and the band did nothing to disappoint. If I had spent all of this year in a coma and awoken at 11:52 p.m. on New Year’s Eve just to hear “Holy Caves” build up into “Surrogate Head,” I’d still tout 2017 as being one of the more incredible years for music. From the opening riff of “Mobius Strip,” I was immediately struck by both the raw and the symphonic elements, which were always present in the band’s music but have been expanded and fine-tuned in this new album. The band’s seamless integration of the gritty and the grand was on full display at the ArcTanGent main stage. This was further augmented by their choice to invite a guest saxophonist to perform with them on several songs in order to wholly do the tracks from the new album justice. Later that day, I saw sleepmakeswaves play the same stage which was an incomparable experience, since The Physics House Band’s sound could easily be described as “if sleepmakeswaves spent their formative years in a dark, gritty garage in Brighton rather than traveling across Australia.” In a weekend of extraordinary performances, The Physics House Band still stands out as one of the most dynamic acts that I have witnessed. The grooves on Mercury Fountain are stunning in their own right, but the band’s ability to maintain that tightness in a live setting, even within such a heavy expanse, was truly a sight to behold.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e3) sleepmakeswaves\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs several of the bands listed in this piece will indicate, the main stage at ArcTanGent brings something different with every act that sets foot on it. This is very exciting for fans, since you never know what to expect other than a great show. sleepmakeswaves’ performance was neither flashy nor over the top, yet each member still exhibited incredible amounts of showmanship without ever neglecting musical nuance. Their music is awesome in the truest sense of the word, as they are able to invoke so much power with both heavy riffs and lush electronics without compromising one in favor of the other. sleepmakeswaves is among the most accessible instrumental bands I’ve come across, and I think that is in large part due to the cinematic quality of their music that can resonate with people on such a fundamental level without ever needing lyrics to convey a message. While many bands face the struggle of being unable to replicate the polished, high-production recordings of their songs in a live setting, sleepmakeswaves faced the opposite problem early in their career in that they couldn’t quite capture the energy and depth of their live performances on their albums. However, with their more recent releases, especially this year’s Made of Breath Only, they have made a concerted effort to release an album that holds all the heaviness and glory of their live performances. It was the larger-than-life recordings of tracks like “Tundra” and “The Edge of Everything” that drew fans to the main stage and captivated every member of the audience with such gravitational force. Across the crowd, you could see a variety of responses as the band was playing; some people were jumping around, others were dancing or emphatically math-head-banging, and several more were just standing and letting the music wash over them. But whatever their physical manifestation, everyone was connected to the music and in absolute awe of what they were witnessing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e2) The Evil Usses\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eComing back to the United States after ArcTanGent, I’ve had to find a way to relay my overseas experiences to my west-coast American friends in terms they would understand. This is what I came up with: If ArcTanGent was hitting up In-N-Out with your squad, The Evil Usses would be that one homie who showed you how to dunk your fries in your shake. You thought they be hella cray and kept sipping your La Croix but then you started munchin’ and it turned out to be next level dopeness. Translation: The only experience I can equate to the first time I heard The Evil Usses to is the first time I ate a french fry (or “chip” if that’s your thing) covered in chocolate milkshake. It simply blew my mind and awoke cravings I didn’t know I had. I also found myself describing them as “if The Physics House Band played four different songs at four different tempos simultaneously but they were all super happy” (and I made that assessment before I found out TPHB’s set would feature a guest saxophonist). Their album Amateur Pro Wrestling immediately jumped out at me during my pre-festival research, due in large part to tracks like “Gambino” and “Pre-Op Pop,” which I have spent as much time dancing around to in my bedroom as I have sitting with my head in my hands trying to wrap my brain around all the layers of rhythmic intricacies emanating from my headphones. The unwavering steadiness of the rhythm section holds down the beat while the guitarist and the keyboardist/saxophonist explore the depths of tone and texture with a plethora of delays and modulators. The songs are loose and playful until you realize how incredibly complex they are. Purists beware, this band is full of contradictions and will defy any label you try to apply to them. But if you’re like me and find immense amounts of joy in odd music that can both challenge and uplift you and is genuinely fun to listen to, buckle up because you’re in for something special.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1651\" data-orig-height=\"1093\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bc693f7b2add09b01d4dfcedf61791fb/tumblr_inline_oz425tE6K91qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1651\" data-orig-height=\"1093\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhoto Credit: Ed Sprake\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e1) Alpha Male Tea Party\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are albums that you share with your friends right after you’ve heard them. Then there are albums you text your friends midway through telling them under no circumstances should they listen to before you can be there to see their reaction in-person. The latter was the situation I found myself in the first time I heard Health, the new Alpha Male Tea Party album and their first release in over three years. Following their main stage set at ArcTanGent, I heard someone refer to the band as “riff machines.” While I understand the sentiment and agree that the riffs are certainly present and as heavy as ever, I’ve found that in comparison to the band’s 2014 album Droids, their new album hardly has a mechanical moment to be found. On the contrary, the album as a whole is deeply emotional right from “Have You Ever Seen Milk,” which opens with near-offputting introspection for those who were simply expecting fat guitars and polymetric bangers. The album name itself is very telling of the circumstances from which the music was created since in the years following Droids’ release one band member has had a baby while a close friend of the band was diagnosed with a brain tumor (That friend is Dan Wild-Beesley, who I spoke with at last year’s ArcTanGent Festival. You can read my conversation with him about his friendship with Tom Peters of Alpha Male Tea Party as well as the breakup of his band Cleft \u003ca href=\"http://uclaradio.tumblr.com/post/151015591414/talking-tangents-and-fond-farewells-with-dan\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere \u003c/a\u003eand I sincerely hope you will check out this \u003ca href=\"http://justgiving.com/fundraising/danbeatcancer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epage\u003c/a\u003e to read his story and find out how you can help). The band’s main stage set brought all the tight jams one would expect as well as the all the emotions of the album compounded tenfold from the sheer volume and depth of the crowd, which was said to be one of the largest main stage turnouts the festival has ever seen. There was also a special addition to the set in the inclusion of a chorus onstage for the final song, “No More,” which was dedicated to Dan. While there was a significant degree of poignancy throughout the set, it never eclipsed the hard and pure rock grooves which have long held Alpha Male Tea Party at the top of my list of “true power trios,” which is how I have come to refer to trios where all three instruments play equal but crucial roles (see also \u003ca href=\"http://uclaradio.tumblr.com/post/150968888330/top-5-most-anticipated-acts-at-arctangent\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTown Portal\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://uclaradio.tumblr.com/post/166762935922/interview-with-vasudeva-arctangent-festival-2017\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eVasudeva\u003c/a\u003e.)

When that time comes, you can bet Health will be near the top of that list and among impeccable company. \u003c/p\u003e",

The venue’s unique space was ideal for the night\u0026rsquo;s performances. It feels like a bowling alley, with pool tables and high ceilings with low hanging lights, where you can grab a burger from Burger Lords and a beer within 10 feet of each other. A good place for a punk show. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe arrived as the night begun, with the first opener Brutus VIII in the middle of their set. His synth goth-punk set was both dreamy and satanic. He wore all black but the contour of glitter on his cheekbones made his nightmarish music a little tamer. His voice gave me Ian Curtis vibes that I really enjoyed. The song “A Friendly Commandeering,” from his album \u003ci\u003eLive at Corporate\u003c/i\u003e, had a playful element that would pull back from the synth-punk and take a moment to jump back in. I always find those moments comical especially because of you expect punk music to have this roaring upbeat effect that allows you to disassociate from yourself. Having been the first on the lineup, the fans were light and Brutus VIII received a humble crowd that I wished more people had joined.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"817\" data-orig-width=\"1228\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/83490586c936f6d22e1d93aaba488dcf/tumblr_inline_oucuhzzMP01qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"817\" data-orig-width=\"1228\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eNext Matter Room took stage and and seemed off pitch from the rest of the night’s bands. They were a jam band that employed useless power chords and gyrating with their instruments. I usually don’t mind jam bands with dark punk but they were not connecting with the audience. They kept to themselves on stage and the lead singer wore a hood. Yet these Highland Park natives had an energetic sound that didn’t add up in a live performance. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"952\" data-orig-width=\"1431\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8cf89e71ea5d1e0cceb7bd46094c045c/tumblr_inline_oucuigws0Y1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"952\" data-orig-width=\"1431\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eModel/Actriz stole the show. Their intensity was an out-of-body experience. From waving his mic over his head in the middle of the pit to having a member of the crowd and vocalist rolling on the floor together, Model/Actriz does not give a dull show. What blew me away was in the middle of their set Cole jumped into the pit and climbed the high beams of The Hi Hat, and the whole time the band was with it. That’s the type of shit I like to see, a whole band on the same level and working together. while most of the previous bands on the night were self-professed punk bands, Model/Actriz and Girl Pusher had a genuine element to them that I absolutely loved, and although this was my first time seeing Model/Actriz, I had heard a lot of great things about them. They have a very heavy noise and avant garde sound in a Death Grips kind of way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"952\" data-orig-width=\"1431\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/31eaed2327f357d03a2441d4c7398231/tumblr_inline_oucuj2CXCA1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"952\" data-orig-width=\"1431\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eLastly, the crowd swelled for Girl Pusher. The vocalist Gabby brought an emotional and powerful presence to the stage. She keeps to herself, hunched over toward the mic, but moves throughout the stage. On stage was only Gabby and drummer Jarrod with a laptop of generated beats. Having a loop on stage would usually annoy me but it didn’t make them seem any less musical or bring them down. Instead, it elevated Gabby’s lyrics and Jarrod’s drums while they performed. Since they haven’t released any music for about two years, their set list has stayed the same since I last saw them around the time they released \u003ci\u003eGroceries EP 2\u003c/i\u003e. Their signature closer, Alice Deejay’s \u0026ldquo;Better Off Alone,\u0026rdquo; is always a crowd-pleaser and after seeing them many times I am never disappointed. Even though it’s a cover, I had a lot of fun getting into it. My favorite song from this LA native duo was “Thanks Bitch” from their singles, because of the parallel relationship of the lyrics and the music and its overall depth that you can get lost in. I hope for new music from the duo in the near future.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLastly, Minty Boi is a booking beast. Be sure to look out for his shows in the future!\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten by Harold Gonzalez-Mejia \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1000\" data-orig-width=\"1000\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4b374273f36738b20a31950231bd693e/tumblr_inline_otiiek4Kv21qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1000\" data-orig-width=\"1000\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe Atlanta crooner with the voice of a cartoon cat disappoints on an in cohesive, unfocused, and hard-to-listen-to debut album, despite having released one of the most unique and interesting mixtapes of 2016.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne can argue right off the bat that the main problem that Lil Yachty has is a lack of overall talent and focus. There is no doubt that the teenager has the ability to construct a very infectious, silly, and fun track that manages to strip off all stereotypes of grit and darkness that is usually associated with hip hop, like enjoyably free spirited and energetic songs such as “Minnesota” and “1 Night.” However, on \u003ci\u003eTeenage Emotions\u003c/i\u003e, the crooner does not manage to string together any worthwhile, digestible or entertaining tracks. In fact, on many instances the crooner’s amateurish charm has disappeared and instead the kid falls short of any kind of previously established value. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne can begin to pick apart the flaws of the record in terms of over-production, mismatched with the same foolish voice that he worked well with on the Lil Boat mixtape. Yachty’s voice made complete sense played on the production that was found on the mixtape: fun, bouncy, colorful production that was assembled with purposely mediocre mixing cuddled the squeaky, wobbly voice provided by the artist. The little mumbles of autotune that dressed Yachty’s voice worked well on simple, straightforwardly melodic beats found on Lil Boat. The rapper has instead abandoned the fun production in exchange for various types of big budgeted production that instead betrays his own unique, fun voice. The various beats, from the reggae-tinged “Better” to the slowly churning “Lady in Yellow,” and the tropical bore that is “Forever Young,” all make the rapper’s voice stand out violently like a sore thumb. There are various moments where the singing provided by Yachty is painful, and falls dramatically short of being as endearing and cute as it did on various moments on Lil Boat. The rapper clearly has to have the correct team behind him on the record in order for success to be achieved.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis can lead one to wonder, “Where the fuck was the Sailing Team?” all over this album. And when Yachty is not providing hard to hear vocals passed off as “singing,” he is falling completely short of being an adequate rapper. Of course, one has to consider that Lil Yachty is no Nas. Nobody is going to this record expecting bars to riddle the entire tracklist through and through. In fact there are gross, unexpected and disgusting mentions of incest and whore fucking throughout the record which leads one to believe that Yachty himself is not capable to carry himself over as a charismatic, slick, or even successful player or ladies man as he so fondly believes he is. “Peek a Boo” is a terrible misunderstanding and execution of a sex driven, dark and hard image. The hook on this track is not memorable as Yachty goes forward to annoy the listener with a horrible repetition of the same phrase, while managing to successfully stay off tempo throughout. The beat on the track is indefensibly boring and quite honestly garbage. Even the feature provided by Migos couldn’t save the track from being forgettable and unsettling. It sounds like Yachty was whispering in the booth to prevent from being found out by his friends for trying to make a banger. Instead of sticking to his guns, the rapper attempts to become something that he will probably never be (in terms of image).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe closest success that Yachty finds to having a banger on the record is “X Men,” but even then if one were to want to slap a slapper, they wouldn’t turn to this song before turning to one of the crooner’s contemporaries. On “DN Freestyle” Yachty sounds like he is angrily ranting on beat. It is as if the rapper has forgotten to truly stay on tempo, or somebody needs to tell his producers to throw the metronome on while the guy is recording. And it is very important to note that the bars don’t have to be extremely well written; Yachty is not putting out a lyrically potent record, but if one is to do this in the current age of hip hop there have to be memorable hooks, memorable slapping beats, memorable features, and very well constructed, vibe driven songs. There is a complete lack of focus throughout this record and nobody is helping Yachty with any of these things. The quality of the record must improve if anyone is willing to slap any of this guy’s records in the near future. It is certain that hype dies with time, and there will not be enough hype to protect Yachty from criticism for his mediocrity if there is no product to support said hype.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e3/10\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

As the show date gets closer, we will be promoting the fabulous band and their upbeat music. Below is our album review of their newest record Lost Time. We’d love to see at the show ~ \u003ca href=\"http://www.theecho.com/event/1148645-tacocat-los-angeles/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etickets are just around $10 and it’s an 18+ event\u003c/a\u003e. Come hang out with some of your favorite DJs!\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The term “summer anthem” is useless in many ways, given it’s mostly manipulated to sell mediocre likeable pop singles, but there is some music that feels like it belongs to the summer, and Tacocat’s \u003ci\u003eLost Time\u003c/i\u003e is just that. The album, which features an excellent blend of garage rock with a healthy dose of riot grrrl, elicits those old, familiar feelings of frustration, exhilaration, and mischievousness that perfectly complements a nostalgia for adolescent boredom and the shenanigans one inevitably falls into during the long summer days and nights. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile the album initially feels a little tame, it unleashes itself with the raucous “Lost in Seattle,” and blossoms from there. The teenage angst sound is layered with quite witty commentary on a variety of issues, from internet trolls to gentrification to X-Files. Tracks “Plan A, Plan B,” and “Men Explain Things to Me,” take on current feminist concerns with a cleverness and vigor that would make Kathleen Hanna proud. “Talk,” one of the strongest tracks on the album, draws you in with a swaying rhythm and the seduction of Emily Nokes’ vocals, and forces you to acknowledge its request, “I wanna dance.” The frankness and quirkiness of Tacocat’s sound allows it to pull of some tracks that, under other circumstances, would most likely crash and burn - it wasn’t until the chorus of the upbeat “Horse Grrls” that I realized I had been jamming out to a song that was actually, totally about horses. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe subject matter of and critiques made in the album are most definitely its strongest feature, and lifts the album above the sea of recent garage rock punk releases. Yet the rich variety of themes isn’t quite matched by the sound, which, while fun and carefree, doesn’t quite manage to break free of repetitiveness and monotony by the end of the album. Still \u003ci\u003eLost Time \u003c/i\u003eis a success for the band and the use of music as cultural criticism, and even though Tacocat had already won my eternal admiration when they announced they were recording the new \u003ci\u003ePowerpuff Girls\u003c/i\u003e theme, their newest album left me overall impressed. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"640\" data-orig-width=\"580\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c800a4eb77889f9faa74be3f5cc94a97/tumblr_inline_o9t3gaSOkC1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"640\" data-orig-width=\"580\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

What a venue/cemetery/chapel! We are honored to play there for 2 nights. I wish it was not sold out and lots more people can come. If it was in Japan, they would let twice as many people in 🙊but I respect it.” While I certainly understand the sentiment, I must say that in all my years as a patron of concerts big and small, across all genres of music, I don’t think I’ve ever witnessed a more perfect pairing of artist, venue, and audience than Blonde Redhead and the Masonic Lodge at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Lodge’s high ceilings gave the layers of music plenty of room to travel. The guitars and vocals, already drenched in reverb, echoed through the hall. The crowd with the intimate energy of 150 true fans carried with it a special kind of buzz. Every emotion was heightened. Songs with stripped instrumental textures like “Barragán” and “Lady M” had more space to resonate while the faster, energetic numbers like “Spring By Summer Fall” and the closing number “Equus” were compressed and transformed into hardcore garage rock.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eThroughout their 23 year career, Blonde Redhead seems to have mastered their own brand of minimalism. Each member walked onstage with the sole intent of allowing the music to play out in the purest way possible. Kazu Makino seemed to effortlessly flow between her guitar and keyboard, sometimes even eschewing both and taking the stage with just a microphone in hand. Vocals alternated between songs with Kazu’s delicate and airy siren and guitarist Amedeo Pace’s strong tenor providing beautifully unconventional contrast in colors and lyrical stories. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhatever arrangement the song called for, no one in the band missed a beat. Sometimes Amedeo would end a song kneeling at his pedalboard, turning knobs and activating loops, deconstructing the well-crafted riff that had been a melodic centerpiece just moments before. Transitions like this between songs kept everyone in the audience swaying even when no discernable melodies or backbeats could be heard. The Lodge’s acoustics transformed Simone Pace’s (Amedeo’s twin brother) tight drums into an expansive wall of percussion. Every sound from the lowest tom to the strike of the synth pad echoed across the room. Rhythm tracks that served as a solid foundation on the recordings became moving pieces of a train on which the minimalist melodies and textures of the other instruments were carried. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile it’s true that the room could have held more than 150 people, the extra space made for larger than life acoustics and allowed everyone to sway and dance freely without worrying about tripping on anyone else’s toes.\u003c/p\u003e",

Not only is it the season for frolicking in the sunshine, but it’s also the time of year where film studios churn out their big blockbusters and hope to attract hefty audiences. Last year, we saw quite a few flashy flicks such as Avengers: Age of Ultron, Jurassic World, and of course, Minions. Despite the lineup breaking a few box office records, I wasn’t impressed by these offerings, with Inside Out as the solely enjoyable exception. This summer, however, I have a higher hopes.

With imaginative classics such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Matilda, and James and the Giant Peach, it is no wonder that Dahl’s stories are frequently adapted for movies and musicals. This summer, The BFG (my personal favorite!) is finally getting its turn in the limelight. Its recent trailers show promise, as The BFG looks to match the fantastical aspects of its source material with giants and dreams abound.  And hey, if it doesn’t turn out as great as we’d hoped — there’s always the book.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSuicide Squad (August 5 2016)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe premise of Suicide Squad is a refreshing take on the typical superhero team movie; whereas the Avengers and (probably eventually) the Justice League fight for good because they are good, the Suicide Squad is made up of dangerous, unstable supervillains that do what they’re told simply because they’re forced to. With an exciting premise and great cast, one can only hope that DC will more than redeem itself from Batman v Superman.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKubo and the Two Strings (August 19 2016)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eProduced by the same studio that gave us Coraline, Kubo and the Two Strings is a stop-motion film set in ancient Japan. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4-6qJzeb3A\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eIts trailer\u003c/a\u003e fascinated me, as I am a sucker for fantasy, beautiful stop-motion, and \u003ca href=\"http://theconceptartblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/KUBO_04.jpg\" class=\"hoverZoomLink\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecreepy witch characters\u003c/a\u003e , and it also gets bonus points for having an epic cover of While My Guitar Gently Weeps play as the background song.\u003c/p\u003e",

The album is significantly different from his 2013 release Silver Wilkinson — \u003ci\u003eA Mineral Love\u003c/i\u003e is like a self-exploration with Bibio playing with more synth pop and vocals distortion. Before this album, Bibio mostly crafted chill electronica that had a lot of experimental pop to it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBibio still creates songs that are classically pop and appeal easily to listeners. Tracks like “Town \u0026amp; Country” and “Why So Serious? feat. Olivier St. Louis” have the catchy rhythm and blissed out synth pop that make it an easy favorite. However, there are tracks on this album that are darker in sound that set a more serious tone and sound. “A Mineral Love” and “C’est La Vie” both take things slower and have muted vocals that almost give the tracks a sense of nostalgia, like hearing the song through the phone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe album finishes with “Light Up The Sky”, which is a perfect culmination of the album. The rhythm is slow and the Bibio really plays with the different layers on this track: using delays and slight reverbs to great this dreamy song. The high pitch of the vocals is also reminiscent of some Passion Pit tracks but there is also a mild funk on the track that echoes the likes of the Minneapolis psych funk scene.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eA Mineral Love\u003c/i\u003e is a collage, a collage of the different sounds Bibio can craft. No two songs sound the same on the album and each song has some elements from different songs, allowing all of them to fit into an album. What I love the most about this album is that there’s a song for almost any mood: some songs are slow, some are bittersweet, some are happy, and etc. It’s definitely an album worth exploring, figuring out what you like and what you don’t but there is definitely something for everyone.\u003c/p\u003e",

05/18/16\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003ci\u003eCaptain America: Civil War\u003c/i\u003e is the third film bearing the Captain America name, and of course, one of countless other titles in the slew that shapes the Marvel Universe.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eAdmittedly, “Superhero\u0026quot; sits right behind “Post-Apocalyptic” when it comes to genres I’m beyond exhausted with.  I\u0026rsquo;m bored with origin stories, citywide destruction, empty motivations, and final battles at high altitudes.  If variety is the spice of life, superhero films are an unseasoned chicken breast.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce the title card dissipates in \u003ci\u003eCivil War,\u003c/i\u003e we’re treated to an espionage-type sequence featuring Black Widow, The Falcon, Wanda Maximoff, and our title character himself.  If you saw this film’s predecessor, \u003ci\u003eThe Winter Soldier\u003c/i\u003e, this scenario should feel pretty familiar to you.  But once the real confrontation starts, the action is impeccably choreographed, and the shots are actually sympathetic to what the human eye is capable of processing.  The Russo brothers endowed so much imagination into every single fight scene in this film, and it’s absolutely refreshing to be able to see every detail of it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe opening sequence culminates in, you guessed it, an explosion.  What happens next however, is what kind of took me by surprise: Dozens of civilians are unequivocally dead, and our heroes are visibly distraught over their own actions.  Meanwhile, Iron Man’s alter ego Tony Stark, is confronted by a grieving mother whose son was killed in the aftermath of a battle initiated by The Avengers in the previous film.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn its exposition alone, \u003ci\u003eCaptain America: Civil War\u003c/i\u003e manages to do something groundbreaking for the genre.  Finally, our protagonists are forced to deal with the inadvertent consequences of their “heroism.”  Most importantly, they face the reality that these large scale threats are caused by the very existence of superheroes themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe actual war between our heroes is set in motion when the US Secretary of State (played by William Hurt) suggests that The Avengers should agree to government oversight in the wake of recent events.  Steve Rogers (Captain America) is immediately opposed to the plan, fearing the government’s agenda and the very notion of having to be dispatched at its discretion.  Stark on the other hand, believes that The Avengers should be put in check, reminding Rogers of all the needless death and chaos that has occurred on their behalf.\u003cbr/\u003eYou may go into the film knowing full well that you’re #TeamCap or #TeamIronMan, but the film will challenge you to see both sides of the conflict: Captain America’s position is driven by foresight and confidence in The Avengers’ judgment without government intervention.  Conversely, Iron Man is coming from a place of pure remorse and a newfound sense of responsibility. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou’ll be hard pressed to pick a side, and this works especially well for a film that deals with a split between protagonists.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile the film’s focus is primarily the aforementioned conflict, various other story elements come into play to enhance the plot: We get an origin story for Black Panther, a very significant role for the Bucky the Winter Soldier, and, my personal favorite, a sweet introduction to the new incarnation of Spider-Man. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTom Holland’s take on Spidey may be my favorite thus far, and that’s saying a lot given his limited screen time.  At this point, its worth noting that this film runs a significant risk by including so many characters in its lineup, but it mostly succeeds in giving everyone a chance to play a significant, or at least memorable role.  Yes, the Spider-Man and Black Panther appearances partially serve to hype up their upcoming solo films, but these characters stand up so well on their own that I don’t even mind the implicit advertising.  Other characters, namely Hawkeye and Ant-Man, are extremely fun to watch during the big battle, but are pretty much only added to increase its scope.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of the much anticipated battle scene between the two camps, I thoroughly appreciated how fun and astonishingly creative it all feels when it comes together—Almost like the action figure battles you’d stage during elementary school summers.  It would have been easy for the Russo brothers to bog down the battle’s tone in order to fit in with \u003ci\u003eCivil War\u003c/i\u003e’s darker themes, but the bright mood they chose made for a very refreshing balance.  Our characters can face trauma and deal with real-world conflict, but we also have to remember that this film takes place in a universe where superheroes are fathomable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWithout spoiling too much, I also want to add the fact that Marvel was finally able to craft a villain that doesn’t feel completely uninspired.  The conflict could have been left up to the heroes alone, but the inclusion of this surprisingly sympathetic third party further strengthens the overarching notion about the unintended consequences of heroism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy complaints are sparse, but they have to do with the film’s 3 hour runtime and the eventual resolution.  While not bad by any means, I found that \u003ci\u003eCivil War\u003c/i\u003e\u0026rsquo;s conclusion stopped on a harmonious note that just didn’t seem likely to me considering the events that had just taken place.  I think the writers should have taken a risk by proposing a more somber ending, just to make the impact of this civil war seem that much more resonant or meaningful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the success of \u003ci\u003eDeadpool\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003eCivil War\u003c/i\u003e comes as another big win for Marvel both at the box office and in my heart.  So maybe I’ll consider taking back what I said about the redundancy of superhero flicks for now.  \u003ci\u003eCaptain America: Civil War\u003c/i\u003e sets a new bar for the genre and spruces up the formula with zestful creativity.  Not an unseasoned cut, but a piquant chicken parm. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By\u003c/i\u003e: Stefanie Tam, UCLA Radio DJ\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date\u003c/i\u003e : 05/09/16\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike a deep maroon shag carpet laced with glitter, Cellars’s album, Phases, is drenched with shimmery notes and echoey reminders of the overdone 80s.  Phases exists from a different time; it’s not an album we can identify with, resonate with, or be reminded of a very real human emotion we’ve experienced in our past bringing a wave of nostalgia, but it is an album that we can appreciate for the image it paints of the very campy time of the 80s.  It highlights the clashing colored clothes, the over romanticized and tacky high school dances, a bubbly, exaggerated way of perceiving the world\u0026ndash; but not necessarily in a way that sounds nearly as bad as how I describe it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt times throughout the album, especially during that of “Still in Love,” one can’t help but feel as though they’re uncomfortably witnessing a tacky 80s movie where the lead has an overdone perm, all while catching the eye of her romantic interest from across the disco lit dance floor.  While we may not like to admit it, maybe Norton has captured that gross, glittery, shimmery look in our eyes that we have when we are in love that we now so desperately try to hide in this time of empowerment of the individual.  At the same time, it feels somewhat resemblant to that of a corny soap opera, something that people shamefully watch at 2 in the morning when no one else is aware.  We fear the judgment of others; we fear the idea of liking something tacky and sappy, what one could argue to be an embodiment of the 80s.  Yet, with Cellars’s mesmerizing voice and repetitive pop synth sound, we can learn to let go and just indulge ourselves in tapping into the sappiest level of our subconscious emotions and not care about this the judgment of others.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce one, especially myself, lets go of this negative impression of the tackiness and melodramatic ways of the 80s, there is much more space to enjoy the layered, glimmer-y, and grossly nostalgic aspect of this music.  While many of the songs on her album take on the more darkened, sexually layered side of the 80s, like that of “Curse Your Love,” the album also has a few playful songs like “Toys” that remind us of that fun, shamelessly colorful side of the 80s that we can look back at and say, “Hey, at least we tried it.”  What is entirely captivating about this album is that, while it would be very easy for Allene Norton’s music to all mash together into one big pile of shimmery goo, each song stands uniquely on its own\u0026ndash; something entirely credited to Cellars’s talents, rather than the era by which she was inspired. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike in the beginning of my review, many have these negative preconceptions of the 80s and see it as a cringeworthy time that we can now mindlessly joke about.  However, what Allene Norton is doing here is creating revivalist music to perhaps redeem and showcase the free spirited and unashamedly gross, sentimental times that we call the 80s.  \u003c/p\u003e",

But the title seems to communicate the instinctual whim artists like Grimes have to disregard tradition taste-making and to embrace pop culture, along with all of its kitsch and pomp.\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile I missed Tei Shi’s set, her experimental and slick pop sound on the 2015 release Verde fits perfectly with that of the following acts. Christine and the Queen’s set began with a deep, pulsing bass which grew into a striding beat as the lively frontwoman Héloïse Letissier entered on the stage for the song “iT” with a group of male dancers clad in black. While I had no experience with the band before, “iT” was a great first introduction, complete with Christine’s playful and theatrical style. As Letissier displayed her syncopated dancing, the song moved into a melodic dialogue on gender and sexuality. Transforming the venue into a French discotèque, Christine and the Queens put on quite a performance, with choreographed dance sequences and explosive outtros. The group paid tribute to Prince on the eve of his death by covering his song “I Feel For You,” which was originally performed by Chaka Khan. Letissier praised Prince’s extraordinary creativity and ability to break from pop music’s gender norms. It would be fair to say that Grimes, Christine and the Queens and Tei Shi follow him down this path.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eEntering in with “Realiti,” Grimes introduced the audience to her own world of warped poptimism and upbeat eccentricity. While there were no costume changes during the course of the show, one could feel her voice underwent many transformations. On songs off of Visions her voice took on a sweet and mystical quality, while clarity on songs from Art Angels evoked confidence, passion, and even fury. Performing “Scream,” Grimes gave an intense rendition of Aristophanes’ verse in Russian, doing her own screaming throughout, of course. After flippantly remarking that she thought the song was great, despite its apparent controversy, she played her moody banger, “Go,” to the delight of the crowd. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe show was geared towards spectacle, the stage and costume design looking as if it were off the set of Mad Max: dystopian and chic. Grimes was accompanied by HANA on backup vocals and by an all-female dance crew, equipped with acrobatic ribbons, sai, and flowers to toss out to the audience. After closing out with the raucous “Kill V Maim,” Grimes left the stage to be played out by Prince’s “Let’s Go Crazy.” Though we’d spent the whole night dancing along, there was time for one more go.\u003c/p\u003e",

Ranging from kids movies such as Little Big League, where a player wraps a string of gum around an egregious wad of chew, to watching current sluggers such as Chris Davis play with bulges in their lips, chewing (smokeless) tobacco, or dip, has long been associated with America’s national pastime.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco; all cities home to some of the MLBs largest and most profitable markets, and more recently, home to chewing tobacco free stadiums. Recently, by a 44-3 vote, the New York City Council added the city to this growing list, banning the use of chewing tobacco at both Yankee Stadium and the Mets’ Citi Field for both players and fans. This legislation has led to a mixed response amongst the baseball community, with fans applauding the vote due to the well known health dangers associated with dip due to its addicting nicotine content, and because the ban on players use sets a better example for children, who make up a large portion of the MLB fan base.  However, players have been outspoken against the ruling, with Chicago Cubs pitcher John Lackey stating, ““I get it, you don’t [want] your Little League kid to do that. I don’t want him [gestures to his nearby son] to do it. I don’t do it personally, honestly. But grown men should have their own choice.” Additionally, New York Mets outfielder and MLB Players Association representative Curtis Granderson was also skeptical about the rule, chiming in  “If you see a player doing something, do you give him something, during the game, after the game?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009As someone who has been dipping on and off since I was a sophomore in high school, and has seen first hand in my family the damage and addiction that chewing tobacco causes, I wasn’t sure at first how I felt about these new rules and regulations. My first reaction was one of anger, thinking of all the good times I have had “packing lips” with teammates on the bench, or in the bleachers of Yankee Stadium on a warm summer afternoon. Not only was dipping used as a bonding experience, but also it almost took the substitute of coffee, in that we’d hang out, and shoot the breeze while throwing in a lip, feeling “cool” in the process. The fact that I would no longer be able to partake in what had almost become a tradition my friends and I in the Bronx left me upset, while I also sympathized with players who will struggle with this new rule because they are addicted to chewing tobacco, which will likely affect them both mentally and in terms of on field performance. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009However, the feeling that ultimately won out was that these rules are not only just, but necessary. In 2014, Tony Gwynn, one of baseball’s greatest hitters and ambassadors off the field, passed away of Cancer of the salivary gland at the way to young age of fifty-four. Gwynn contributed his diagnosis to his use of chewing tobacco that dated back to his time in rookie ball in 1981. Earlier in the year, perennial All Star and ESPN broadcaster Curt Schilling was diagnosed with throat cancer; although his diagnosis differed from Gwynn’s, he to felt that his cancer was result of thirty plus years of dipping. Although there is no direct correlation between the new rules and the cancer diagnoses of two baseball legends, it appears that this was the wake up call baseball needed, as teams soon after began to ban chewing tobacco at their stadiums. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYes, players should have every right to do what they with their bodies, and yes, chewing tobacco has been a part of the game longer than most of us on Earth have been alive.  But at the end of the day, these rules are meant to do one thing and one thing only, and that is keep MLB players, and possibly more importantly the fans, healthy and alive. While my own dipping has greatly subsided over the past two years, there are still times, where I, like many of the players who will be affected by this rule, will crave nothing more than to throw in a lip. Yet here I am, still trying to quit, because (and hopefully the MLB will realize this) if a guy who was a superhuman on and off the field like Tony Gwynn could fall because of chewing tobacco, what makes us think we are invincible?\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

In many ways their second album Sonic Bloom seemed just like part two of their self titled debut studio album Night Beats, but the new album manages to distinguish itself. Who Sold My Generation retains the band’s signature mixture of blues and psychedelic rock but takes a step further. It’s as if the adolescent garage rock they also take influence from grew up a little and grew more confident in their own shoes. Night Beats, now comfortable with their old sound, dives deeper with even more new inspirations - track “Porque Mañana” is sung all in Spanish, “Egypt Berry” adds Middle Eastern influences, and “Bad Love” pays homage to 60’s surf rock. It’s also easy to hear the impact of Robert Levon Been of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, who guitarist and singer Lee Blackwell cited as important to the production of the album. For those new to Night Beats, the band is akin to if the early Black Keys, B.B. King, and Ty Segall all got together in a garage, dropped acid, and made some music. It’s interesting to see how the musicians have shaped their sound around their local music scene. The band members grew up in Austin and are now based out of Seattle, and the distorted sound of the Seattle grunge scene puts a unique spin on Texas rock and blues. Overall, Who Sold My Generation finally grasps the idea Sonic Bloom and Night Beats were hinting at and pulls in new creative influences, creating an original and catchy album. I’m already looking forward to what Night Beats is going to do next. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

By that time, physics had progressed well enough that most orbits and positions of planets could be predicted many decades if not centuries into the future. However, some astronomers noticed that for Uranus, the farthest then-known planet, wasn’t following the physics equations as nicely as hoped. It seemed like something was tugging on it, disturbing its orbit. From these observations, it was hypothesized that another planet, too far to see with the naked eye, was out there waiting to be found. And in 1846 it was found, just where it was predicted. It was a testament to the accuracy of physics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday, history may be repeating itself as astrophysicists have noticed similar perturbations in orbits of trans-Neptunian objects. Those objects are the small, icy bodies whose orbits can be tens or even \u003ci\u003ehundreds\u003c/i\u003e of times farther away from the sun than our Earth. It’s quite cold and dark there, and it’s hard to spot even large objects. But using the same techniques that led to the discovery of Neptune, researches at Caltech are hypothesizing that a ninth planet is indeed out there waiting to be discovered.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile not officially confirmed, the researchers can use the data from disturbed orbits to estimate things about the mysterious body. They estimate it is 20 times farther from the sun than Earth (or about 186 \u003ci\u003emillion \u003c/i\u003emiles) and would weigh about 10 times more than Earth (or about 5 thousand \u003ci\u003ebillion \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003ebillion\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e tons).

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By\u003c/i\u003e: Andy Talajkowski, UCLA Radio DJ (02/03/2016)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re exhausted by this year’s award season, which has been dominated by The Revenant and the Oscar’s apparent inability to recognize actors of color, then be prepared to renew your faith in film - there were several overlooked yet extraordinary movies from the past year that deserve a second glance. I’ll admit, I saw Star Wars: The Force Awakens not once but twice in theaters, and reveled in Tarantino’s glorious 70mm, but there were many filmmakers who made much riskier and, in my opinion, much more exciting movies than many of the current award nominees. The next six lesser known films are in much need of due recognition.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1. ‘71\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Watch if you like: Cook from Skins, historical action dramas\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Jack O’Connell is astounding as British soldier Gary Hook, who is abandoned in the neighborhoods of Northern Ireland after his unit is attacked in an IRA riot. With both the rebel army and his fellow soldiers desperate to find him, Hook is stuck in a game of cat and mouse that keeps you at the edge of your seat until the very end. In an era of action movies where people are constantly shot, stabbed, and blown up without the blink of an eye, director Yann Demange (in his full length feature debut) reverse’s Hollywood’s approach to violence and makes the small number of deaths that occur in the film as shocking and point blank as if the viewer is witnessing them in real life. Managing to provide empathy for both sides, the film allows us to view the tension of Britain and Northern Ireland that occurred in the 1970s from both perspectives, and see the losses both suffered. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e2. The Stanford Prison Experiment\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Watch if you like: raw, unflinching thrillers\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The cast of new up and coming actors in this film is to die for: Ezra Miller, Thomas Mann, Tye Sheridan, Keir Gilchrist, Michael Angarano, Jack Kilmer, and Olivia Thirby (and trust me, the list goes on) make the movie adaptation of the events of the infamous Stanford Prison Experiment absolutely electric. The movie quickly dismisses any possibility of a melodramatic or sensational interpretation and goes straight for the heart - the movie is relentless and expresses just how easily the young participants get swept up into a simulation of the prison environment and the abuses of power. Billy Crudup is fantastic as a professor who struggles to figure out where to draw the line in his fascinating yet terrifying experiment, which was stopped after just six days. The interactions of “inmate” and “guard” are so shocking it’s hard to believe the film is based on actual events.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3. The End of the Tour\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Watch if you like: Jesse Eisenberg being Jesse Eisenberg, honest, unedited dialogue\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The End of the Tour is based on the Rolling Stone interview that occurred between author David Foster Wallace and journalist David Lipsky, and features little more than the two characters talking and driving along the last leg of Wallace’s book tour for Infinite Jest. Yet the lack of action is made up by fascinating, authentic dialogue that lets us see into the life of Wallace, a troubled, quiet, yet brilliant writer who would later commit suicide. Jesse Eisenberg is quick-witted and arrogant as Lipsky, and Jason Segel is absolutely wonderful as Wallace. Segel’s role as a more serious character will have you questioning why he hasn’t been doing these roles for a long time - it’s truly a shame he was overlooked this awards season.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e4. Me and Earl and the Dying Girl\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWatch if you like: quirky teen stories, crying your eyes out\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough Me and Earl and the Dying Girl received moderately widespread attention, its inability to shake the pervasive teenage coming-of-age label made some underestimate one of the best films of the year. Based on the novel of the same name, the fantastic script was adapted by author Jesse Andrews himself, keeping the story authentic and free of Hollywood meddling. If you’re convinced this is just another teen cancer narrative similar to The Fault in Our Stars, STOP IN YOUR TRACKS - the film is truly so much more. Awkward, eccentric, creative, and heartbreaking, this movie swept Sundance and won both the Audience Award and Grand Jury Prize. Be warned, however - as a person who very rarely cries during movies, the tears were streaming both times I saw this film in theatres (yes, I liked it so much I went to see it again.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e5. Girlhood\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWatch if you like: coming of age foreign cinema, silence as much as dialogue\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009In another film helping to redefine the dreaded coming of age movie genre, Girlhood takes away the tremendous overload of hormones and drama and lets the viewer appreciate and observe the small, significant events of a teenage girl’s life. Director Celine Sciamma previously explored gender in her film Tomboy, which features a young transgender character, and she is back again to look at the complexities of womanhood as expressed through teenage protagonist Vic. The film is so subtle in capturing the rich details of Vic’s ever changing world you won’t even mind having to read the subtitles. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e6. Appropriate Behavior\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWatch if you like: Girls and Jenny Slate\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDesiree Akhavan shot to the top of my queer crush list when she burst into the Hollywood scene with Appropriate Behavior, which she wrote, directed, and starred in. She adds to the new branch of romantic comedy where female protagonists fuck, fuck up, and (surprise!) don’t end up with Prince Charming, and don’t really need him either. Akhavan follows in Lena Dunham’s footsteps but ditches the white feminism for more interesting commentary on the intersection of her queer and Iranian identities. Combine Appropriate Behavior with Obvious Child (a similar gem from 2014) for a  movie night that celebrates the long awaited combination cinema and the modern woman. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHonorable Mentions: It Follows, Tangerine, Grandma, Mistress America\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWords By: \u003c/i\u003eChase Madorsky, UCLA Radio DJ  \u003ci\u003e1/17/2016\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter electing four players last year, the Baseball Writers of America have had their votes tallied, and two players were elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame as part of their 2016 class: Mariners and Reds outfielder Ken Griffey Jr, and Dodgers and Mets catcher Mike Piazza. Prior to the voting period, over 100 sports writers were stripped of their ballots due to not having covered the game of baseball in the past ten years. As a result, many fans and analysts predicted vastly different results from 2015, as the voting body shifted towards younger, and more analytic based voters. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Elected with a record 99.3% of the vote, Ken Griffey Jr. enters the Baseball Hall of Fame on his first appearance on the ballot, where he will be enshrined in Cooperstown wearing a Mariners hat after appearing on all but three (437 out of 440) of the writers’ ballots. The son of former All Star Ken Griffey Sr., Junior became the first player to be selected as a number one overall draft pick to be elected to the Hall of Fame. A thirteen time all star, Griffey is regarded as one of the games’ premier all around players, winning ten straight Gold Glove awards in the outfield and finishing his career with 630 home runs, the sixth most all time. The greatness of Griffey can be summed up in the fact that many in the baseball world felt he had a legitimate chance to become the first unanimously voted Hall of Famer. Although he ultimately fell short of that mark, “The Kid” finished with 83.7 Wins Above Replacement, (The 57\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e most in baseball history) and the 1997 AL MVP Award, while widely being credited as the man who saved baseball in Seattle. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009A man known for his clutch heroics such as his game-winning home run against the Braves as New York was reeling following 9/11, Mike Piazza received 83% of the electorate vote to enter the Hall of Fame. Regarded as the best hitting catcher in baseball history, Piazza finished his career with 427 home runs and a .308 career batting average despite falling all the way to the 62nd round of the 1988 amateur draft. A twelve time all star and ten time Silver Slugger award winner as the best hitting catcher in the National League, Piazza was the heart and soul of the New York Mets, leading the team into the Subway Series in 2000 and famously refusing to back down against Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens. Piazza’s election is not without controversy; although he never failed a drug test or has been directly indicted for performance enhancing drug use, there were sports writers who speculated Piazza was using steroids due to his back hair and acne. Although Piazza is an incredibly deserving Hall of Famer (one whom I find to be clean, and someone who should’ve easily slid in on his first ballot) he is also the first player to be connected to steroids to enter the Hall of Fame, which could lead to a shift in voting totals going forward for alleged steroid users such as Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Just missing the required 75% of the vote needed for induction were Jeff Bagwell, Tim Raines, and Trevor Hoffman, who finished with 71.6%, 69.8%, and 67.3% of the vote respectably. In his sixth year on the ballot, Bagwell’s voter percentage increased by about sixteen percent, putting him on the cusp of election next year. The 1994 NL MVP, Bagwell displayed a rare combination of power and speed for a first baseman, finishing his career with 449 home runs and 1401 runs batted in, but also 202 steals, including ten seasons with double digit totals. Raines made his fourteenth appearance on the ballot, jumping fifteen percent as he heads into his final year on the ballot in 2017. Regarded as one of the finest leadoff hitters to play the game and the National League’s answer to Rickey Henderson, Raines concluded his career with 1,571 runs scored, 2,605 hits, 1,330 walks, and 808 steals (fifth all time) all of which are the marks of a dominant table setter at the top of the order. Although there are currently only five closers in the Hall of Fame, longtime Padres closer Trevor Hoffman made a very strong debut on the ballot. One of only two players to record 600 saves in their career; Hoffman is widely thought to be one of the greatest closers of all time, saving thirty or more games thirteen times in his career. With the debate still raging on whether or not the specialized position of a closer should be represented in the Hall of Fame, it will be interesting to see if Hoffman enters Cooperstown in 2017. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Despite the younger group of voters, the results were not kind to players who have been linked to steroids throughout their retirement. Although both players jumped to the 45% vote range, all time home run king Barry Bonds and seven time Cy Young award winner Roger Clemens still fell significantly short of the votes needed to gain election. Although they are trending upwards, many speculate that Bonds and Clemens needed a larger jump in their vote tallies this year from the voter changeover in order to have any chance of gaining entrance into the Hall of Fame. Similarly, despite all hitting over 500 home runs in their career, Mark McGwire, Gary Sheffield, and Sammy Sosa all received less than 13% of the vote, casting a shadow over the probability that players linked to steroids will ever get the support they needed from the Baseball Writers of America. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Joining McGwire, a notable player whose time on the ballot has expired is former Tiger shortstop Allan Trammel, who led the Tigers to the 1984 World Series and whom many hoped would get a big push in his final appearance on the ballot. Additionally, notable players who failed to received five percent of the vote and were thus removed from the ballot included two time AL batting champion Nomar Garciaparra and Jim Edmonds, the owner of eight Gold Gloves and 393 home runs. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Looking forward to 2017, it is likely that Raines, Bagwell, and Hoffman all find themselves giving induction speeches as the logjam of strong players on the ballot continues to clear up. Notable players who will be joining the ballot include Vladimir Guerrero, Ivan Rodriguez, Manny Ramirez, and Jorge Posada, all of whom have legitimate arguments in their own right to join the Hall of Fame. \u003c/p\u003e",

So she was a teenager during the 90s while I was like, you know born in \u0026lsquo;95, so like '97 when you can remember things. '98, I was three, 'ya know so (laughs) basic math. I was watching \u0026ldquo;Supa Dupa Fly\u0026rdquo; video by Missy and I just wanted to be in this green pasture she was in in the video. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why, I just\u0026hellip;liked looking at that video\u0026hellip;it was the aesthetics of hip hop at the time and the music videos they were a lot different. I did love \u0026ldquo;Back Dat Azz Up\u0026rdquo;. (pauses) I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have been watching that video, but none of us should\u0026rsquo;ve-\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKT: Well we didn\u0026rsquo;t even really know what we were talking about.

It was the weird, cool \u0026ldquo;afro-futuristic\u0026rdquo; aesthetics that I saw in Hip Hop. It was watching \u0026ldquo;Hot Boyz\u0026rdquo; with Eve, you know a lot of women drew me into Hip Hop. Eve, Missy, it was \u0026ldquo;no matta what people say\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, you know these videos and these songs. Then Lauryn Hill just sealed the deal, and I was like, \u0026ldquo;Yo, I can mess with this. I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure if I can do this, but I can listen to this all day.\u0026rdquo; And then my music skills kicked in, and it was a wrap after that.

It was all that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eKT: So what would you define as an artist? You\u0026rsquo;re talking about Missy, and Lauryn Hill, and back in the day and how Hip Hop used to make you feel and everything. To second that, would you say that some of those people are more artists or considered more of an artist than some of the mainstream Hip Hop artists of today?\u003cbr/\u003eIS: The only reason I would say yes is because I feel that art is about originality, in my opinion. Anything can be art, but what makes it special is originality and being innovative and I feel like right now we are in a real \u0026ldquo;cookie cutter\u0026rdquo; age where everything, even the videos have to look the same. Where everyone\u0026rsquo;s trying to have this flow, you know, \u0026ldquo;I want a Drake flow. I want a Future flow. I want to sound like this person.\u0026rdquo; When before everyone was like, \u0026ldquo;Nah, I wanna sound like who we are and whoever\u0026rsquo;s going to like it is going to take to it.\u0026rdquo; It wasn\u0026rsquo;t really so much about being liked, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t so much about pleasing anyone. I really just think it\u0026rsquo;s a change in mainstream Hip Hop. At one time, Mainstream Hip Hop to me was very\u0026hellip; It was still underground in the sense that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the popular thing to do, but it was, for our culture, it was still a \u0026ldquo;norm\u0026rdquo;, but the \u0026ldquo;norm\u0026rdquo; was to be different. Now the \u0026ldquo;norm\u0026rdquo; is to be the same. And that\u0026rsquo;s my only thing, but there are still plenty of artists today that are trying to, I\u0026rsquo;m one of them, who\u0026rsquo;s trying to make their own sound. Chance the Rapper does a great job. Of course we are all influenced by someone. Hip Hop stems from so many different genres, so we all have a root from music of different sorts. Chance the Rapper is new to me, like his sound. Noname Gypsy. Even J. Cole. Kendrick! Like they have influences of other giants. My thing is if you\u0026rsquo;re trying to make your money, trying to feed your family, do what you gotta do. But that love in Hip Hop stemmed from being so creative and so different.\u003cbr/\u003eKT: You\u0026rsquo;re talking about originality and creativity, especially in music. How do you think you do that within your own music?\u003cbr/\u003eIS: I\u0026rsquo;m talking about things that happen to girls in real life and my message is not exploited by anyone. There\u0026rsquo;s no one behind my music telling me how to write or telling me, \u0026ldquo;make this more sexy\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s just for anyone who wants to listen. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to say it\u0026rsquo;s just for women, it\u0026rsquo;s for everybody. But I\u0026rsquo;m really the master behind what I\u0026rsquo;m saying. I think that makes me different than everybody because I feel like a lot of people are being told what to talk about. Also with my vocals. I have a raspy voice, and incorporate different harmonies because of my choir background. It\u0026rsquo;s got a bit of an old 90\u0026rsquo;s, hip hop sound sometimes. There\u0026rsquo;s reggae, there\u0026rsquo;s Afrobeat in there. Just whatever I\u0026rsquo;m feeling.\u003cbr/\u003eKT: So it\u0026rsquo;s you.\u003cbr/\u003eIS: It\u0026rsquo;s me. I had a slight obsession with Afro-Latino culture when I was younger so sometimes I\u0026rsquo;ll speak in Spanish. It\u0026rsquo;s really just how I\u0026rsquo;m feeling. (laughs)\u003cbr/\u003eKT: Do you feel like anyone pigeonholes you? Because I know a lot of people say that you have an India.Arie type of feel, an Erykah type of thing, and while those are completely good compliments, do you ever feel like that may pigeonhole you into a genre? While you feel like, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t really do a genre, it\u0026rsquo;s really just me and how I feel\u0026rdquo;?\u003cbr/\u003eIS: Yes, I do feel like people do that in general just on a daily basis with everything. People can be lazy in their thinking so we always like to categorize what we may not understand or think we understand. So I do think I\u0026rsquo;m pigeonholed, and right now I think it has to do with my name. \u0026ldquo;Indigenous Soul, what does that mean? Sounds like you\u0026rsquo;re walking through the Cameroonian rainforest.\u0026rdquo; You know?\u003cbr/\u003eKT: But you wanted that didn\u0026rsquo;t you? I mean where did the name Indigenous Soul come from?\u003cbr/\u003eIS: I was on the bus (laughs) I was trying to get to Slauson and Sepulveda, right by the Fox Hills Mall. I had been brainstorming different names for a minute but they all made me feel like, \u0026ldquo;nah, that\u0026rsquo;s too much\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;that\u0026rsquo;s just not enough\u0026rdquo;. Nothing made me go, \u0026ldquo;Okay! That\u0026rsquo;s the one!\u0026rdquo; And then one day on the bus, I was just like, \u0026ldquo;What about Indigenous Soul?\u0026rdquo; People always say the cliche, \u0026ldquo;A voice came into my head\u0026rdquo; story, but that\u0026rsquo;s basically what happened. It came to me, and I just kept it. It has several meanings to me. If you break down the word \u0026ldquo;indigenous\u0026rdquo;, it means \u0026ldquo;native to a place or native to a certain area\u0026rdquo;. On the literal sense, I am an indigenous African, because my parents are from Bamenda, Cameroon. But that\u0026rsquo;s not really even the reason for my name. I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m from \u0026ndash; actually I don\u0026rsquo;t know where I\u0026rsquo;m from. I\u0026rsquo;m just a native soul. I don\u0026rsquo;t know how I got here, but I just feel like I\u0026rsquo;m a child of the universe. That\u0026rsquo;s where my name comes from.\u003cbr/\u003eKT: I think I like your name better now that I know that. (laughs) So talking about not wanting to be pigeonholed and that this is a reflection of you, what\u0026rsquo;s the biggest thing that you want people to take away from your music?\u003cbr/\u003eIS: There\u0026rsquo;s a few things, but one of the things is to not be afraid to try new things. Not be afraid to talk about things that other people are afraid to talk about and to really be yourself. Because I am neither hot nor cold, I listen to Blackstar and then I\u0026rsquo;ll go twerk at the club. My intention is not to be different. It\u0026rsquo;s not to be, \u0026ldquo;I must be zen\u0026rdquo;. I mean thanks to Bryson Tiller, we have Trapsoul, I might make a soulful trap song one day and be cool with that. It\u0026rsquo;s really just about \u0026ndash; I just want people to believe in themselves more once they listen to it. I want them to listen to my music and whatever topic I\u0026rsquo;m talking about and for them to be like, \u0026ldquo;I can go and do, whatever the heck I want to do because I have the capability\u0026rdquo;. Because that\u0026rsquo;s really how I started. I had no training. My parents came here on a very school-related tip, \u0026ldquo;I got here on scholarship, education was my way out of poverty in an African country.\u0026rdquo; That was the move. They had a child singing, and were like, \u0026ldquo;Okay, I\u0026rsquo;ll let her sing in the corner but she still needs to get these A\u0026rsquo;s in school.\u0026rdquo; I wasn\u0026rsquo;t trained, so I think my music is to say that it\u0026rsquo;s just whatever raw talent you have, harness it and whatever comes your way take advantage of it. Just do well in life, in whatever way you want to. I want you to be empowered in the way you want to be empowered. Whatever I say is how I think, but I\u0026rsquo;m not pushing that on you \u0026ndash; Scratch that, I want your spirit to lifted after listening. That\u0026rsquo;s really it. Let me also clarify, it\u0026rsquo;s feel good as well as \u0026ndash; I just want you to feel what I\u0026rsquo;m feeling too. If I\u0026rsquo;m mad about corruption, I want you to take from that song, \u0026ldquo;Damn, some shit\u0026rsquo;s really going on wherever she\u0026rsquo;s talking about.\u0026rdquo; I think sometimes we\u0026rsquo;re caught in this mindless turn up music, which is okay because I love it, but at the same time let\u0026rsquo;s have a balance and  let\u0026rsquo;s feel sometimes. Let\u0026rsquo;s not always be, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t give a fuck, I don\u0026rsquo;t give a fuck.\u0026rdquo; Let\u0026rsquo;s give fucks about certain things.\u003cbr/\u003eKT: So with that being said, you wanting to a be an inspirational artist, \u0026ldquo;I want your soul to be uplifted when you listen to me\u0026rdquo;, and that\u0026rsquo;s what you like in music you listen to yourself, what artists are you listening to \u0026ndash; and not just music artists, but artists in all forms of the word \u0026ndash; are you listening to, watching, looking at, and are inspiring you right now?\u003cbr/\u003eIS: What I\u0026rsquo;m watching is Cecile Emeke, she has a series on YouTube called \u0026ldquo;Strolling\u0026rdquo;. It documents and gives people Bamenda, Cameroon. But that\u0026rsquo;s not really even the reason for my name. I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m from \u0026ndash; actually I don\u0026rsquo;t know where I\u0026rsquo;m from. I\u0026rsquo;m just a native soul.

It documents and gives people a platform to speak about their experiences as members of the black diaspora. It started out in the UK, they have about 10 episodes of young black people from the UK of all different ethnicities \u0026ndash; Caribbean, Afro-British \u0026ndash; just all kinds from all over the globe. Then they went to France and they interviewed some Afro-French people. It really just gives you an understanding of situations of black people that\u0026rsquo;s not just happening in America, and they have 4 episodes where they went to the Netherlands, they have 2 episodes about Afro-Italians. People that I didn\u0026rsquo;t even \u0026ndash; of course I knew they existed, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t familiar with their experiences, and what they go through, their struggle. I like that because it\u0026rsquo;s so real that it reminds me of my art. I just like truth. I don\u0026rsquo;t even have to relate to it, as long as it feels real. That\u0026rsquo;s in no way scripted, everyone just talks about what they want to talk about \u0026ndash; struggles, joys, things that piss them off. I like the rawness of it. To me, the interviews are just very artistic. J Dilla samples in the background of every single one or most of them. Music, Iisten to Blackstar, \u0026ldquo;King Kunta\u0026rdquo; by k. dot, Choquibtown, an Afro-Columbian group. I like Buika, she\u0026rsquo;s an Afro-Spanish singer. Shoutout to Mr. Faverly from the 11th grade for putting me on that. (laugh) A lot of Afrobeat, I just go on any soundcloud link and see what comes up, but it really just depends on my mood. If I want to dance I\u0026rsquo;ll turn on some Afrobeat. Cry, some India.Arie and to let somethings flow. Not just cry, if I want to be into my spirit. When I want to be funky, Erykah. If I want to be conscious, Iman Omari, Moruf. I feel your music, bruh. (laughs) Whatever I can walk to and feel really good. Sometimes I listen to angry rap, it just depends, but it\u0026rsquo;s definitely global. Majority of the time conscious. Sometimes very unconscious, I really like Kodak Black\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;SKRT\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s a really good song.\u003cbr/\u003eKT: With you saying whatever you\u0026rsquo;re feeling, that\u0026rsquo;s what you\u0026rsquo;re listening to, you don\u0026rsquo;t like to just listen to one artist, is that what you love most about the artists that you listen to? That whatever they\u0026rsquo;re making, their emotion is put into it?\u003cbr/\u003eIS: Definitely. Sometimes the emotion is just in the beat! And that\u0026rsquo;s okay because I can appreciate production. But yeah, I listen to these artists because they share who they are through their music. Honestly, that\u0026rsquo;s a really hard question. \u003cbr/\u003eKT: When you\u0026rsquo;re creating your art, when you\u0026rsquo;re making your music or when you\u0026rsquo;re drawing or painting or dancing or whatever, what\u0026rsquo;s your process? Or are do you even have one?\u003cbr/\u003eIS: A lot of times words just come to me with melodies already attached to them. Sometimes I hear beats, it\u0026rsquo;s usually a soulful beat or a funky beat. I\u0026rsquo;ll just start singing, like a character will just come out of nowhere within me and put lyrics to it. It may even be some stuff that I\u0026rsquo;m not experiencing, but just like Tupac said in Kendrick\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Mortal Man\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s really just the dead homies speaking through whoever that vessel is.\u0026rdquo; Things just come to me. My dancing process is really just how I feel, literally vibing with whatever sound I\u0026rsquo;m hearing and putting those vibes into my movements. Sometimes I\u0026rsquo;ll make a song and leave it alone and be done. Sometimes I have to wait 2 months, it just depends. There is some type of format because I usually need a beat first, but if I\u0026rsquo;m in nature and God puts something in my head, I\u0026rsquo;ll just sing it out loud and record it on my phone, then come back to it. It\u0026rsquo;s very scattered, but it works for me.\u003cbr/\u003eKT: What is your\u0026hellip;I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t say end goal, but what are you working towards with your art?\u003cbr/\u003eIS: That\u0026rsquo;s a wonderful question. College has me wondering.\u003cbr/\u003eKT: Because I know this is one thing that I\u0026rsquo;m struggling with right now.\u003cbr/\u003eIS: Yeah, I think because we\u0026rsquo;re also not just wondering what we\u0026rsquo;re working towards in our art, but in life. That can be very conflicting because sometimes thinking too deeply into the future makes me forget about my art a little bit. But to be honest, I want to empower myself with my art so I can empower others. I\u0026rsquo;m working towards making little black girls feel like they can do anything, which is a way that Jilly from Philly, the glorious Jill Scott, made me feel. That\u0026rsquo;s how Erykah Badu made me feel. Lauryn\u0026hellip;just\u0026hellip;empowering little black girls and also black boys. That\u0026rsquo;s one of my goals, but on a very global level because I know a lot of the oppression that we face is global, it\u0026rsquo;s not just in one place for black people or anybody. I just want to empower anyone who feels like they can\u0026rsquo;t do something or if anything is holding them back or any inferiority complex. I want my music to be a reminder, even if it\u0026rsquo;s just \u0026ldquo;I look good right now\u0026rdquo;. If that\u0026rsquo;s a reminder that you need, I\u0026rsquo;ll bring you that. I want to leave room for more creativity. Erykah did so many things that made me like, \u0026ldquo;If Erykah can do that, well shoot I can do! I like the fact that we\u0026rsquo;ve had so many people be pioneers for us. We\u0026rsquo;ve already been given the okay for things that may seem out of the \u0026quot;norm\u0026rdquo;, because those people did it. So I want to further push those boundaries.\u003cbr/\u003eKT: I know that\u0026rsquo;s kind of hard to do because we\u0026rsquo;re in 2015 and we\u0026rsquo;re coming so late in the game, that it\u0026rsquo;s hard to push boundaries. I actually was listening to an interview the other day and they were saying that it\u0026rsquo;s not the point that you go into it saying, \u0026ldquo;Okay I\u0026rsquo;m going to make something new. You need to look at the things that inspire you, take that, and then say, 'How is this me?\u0026rsquo; Because that\u0026rsquo;s when you\u0026rsquo;re making something new. Because nobody can be you.\u003cbr/\u003eIS: If the only thing I do is inspire, then that\u0026rsquo;ll be okay with me. I want people to dance. I want people to laugh. I\u0026rsquo;m not really a serious person, I\u0026rsquo;m a soulful person, but I\u0026rsquo;m a goofball. The end goal should be me being completely comfortable with my artistry, whether I\u0026rsquo;m in front of one person or 10,000 people, so that that energy can transfer to everyone in my presence. I want them to feel comfortable with themselves. I want it to be that type of exchange \u0026ndash; you give me your ears and I give you some comfort. \u003cbr/\u003eKT: So you\u0026rsquo;re talking about stadiums, do you want to be that type of artist? Career wise now. Is the end goal as far as your career, to pack out stadiums or do you want to fill out a coffee house or two?\u003cbr/\u003eIS: I definitely want to pack out festivals more than stadiums. Festivals for sure. (laughs) If everyone\u0026rsquo;s okay with me being me, me being things that you may not understand \u0026ndash; on your stage \u0026ndash; then I\u0026rsquo;ll pack out tons of stadiums, but I\u0026rsquo;ll never water myself down for what mainstream America wants me to be. If everyone\u0026rsquo;s cool with me being myself and my art, I will pack out the world. But it really just depends on who rocks with me. I rather have 100 people in the room really rocking with me, then a stadium full of people who are like, \u0026quot;Who is this girl?\u0026rdquo; People who are not open to understanding that which seems unfamiliar. You\u0026rsquo;re going to have to have an open mind if you\u0026rsquo;re going to listen to me. As long as the recording labels don\u0026rsquo;t come to me indirectly saying, \u0026ldquo;We want you to be a female bojangles\u0026rdquo;, then I\u0026rsquo;ll pack their stadiums. But if that\u0026rsquo;s what it sounds like they\u0026rsquo;re looking for, then I\u0026rsquo;ll stick to my 100 people.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can find Indigenous Soul\u0026rsquo;s music at:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/indigenoussoul\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/indigenoussoul\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCheck her out for a truly uplifting sound.You can reach her for a collab at \u003ca href=\"mailto:theindisoul@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etheindisoul@gmail.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Fortunately, this “album mixtape” features some of Drake’s more sophisticated and egotistical rhymes and themes about being at the top of the game and yadda yadda yadda. That’s not necessarily a bad thing in this case because Drake definitely does it well. Tracks like “Wednesday Night Interlude” and “6PM In New York” are just two out of this selection of bangers that are included and fit very well in the context of the record but are quite special (the former technically being a PARTYNEXTDOOR song and the latter being considered as a “bonus track” to the record). There are quite a lot of surprises, but the biggest one is that when this surprise dropped back in February, it blew up everywhere and it is a damn good mixtape.

Blackbear is a up and coming crooner out of Florida, fresh off a couple mixtapes dropped within the last couple years. After sitting through the entire piece, my main gripe with this record is that the artist truly lacks any sort of unique, revealing quality to his music. From the opener, “Gucci Linen,” blackbear sifts through a run of the mill trap beat; boastful and braggadocios, yes…entertaining and rich with personality, no. I could go on a limb and state that this is the most obvious attempt at a label attempting to capitalize off of an artist that is more generic than G Eazy. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is not a single redeeming quality in this album. “If you rock Yeezys, we can’t be friends,” and similar one liners that reek of forgettable, boring, and overly materialistic ideas are riddled over beats that are certainly unrecognizable in a pack of online YouTube ‘FREE (INSERT RAPPER NAME HERE) TYPE BEATS.’ “Bright Pink Tims” is a boring excuse for a fashion driven banger that could never rival anything similar to “RAF” by A$AP Rocky. “Playboy Shit” is an overly sugared, criminally absentminded and undercooked song with a mediocre hook and thumping kick drum. “I need a couple bands before we talk,” “That’s some playboy shit right there,” “Swear to God I got a lot of money,” and other pathetic bars that do not do anything but make audience’s eyes roll. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBlackbear arguably does not have a voice that commands or stirs emotions in the listener; matter of fact, the remedial chorus gets repeated about four times on the track, and his singing voice honestly does not draw the slightest need for such repetition in the listener. Aesthetically, the album is nothing but glossy synths and rattling trap percussion, with blackbear’s slightly autotuned crooning spewed all over the beats in organized, cabinet filed fashion. “Sex on the couch, it was cool, it was basic,” and many other attempts at being truly sexy, truly passionate, and truly anything fall flaccid, weak, and unentertaining. Blackbear enlisted the services of the “FKA Twigs for normies” and discount Rihanna, Tinashe, for another ultra basic bitch chorus on “Up in This.” The subtly corny and glossy hook, “We up in this bitch now,” paired with ugly stretched vocalizations around the 2:50 mark is certainly not enough to make listeners remember who this newfound crooner is. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe charisma that the rapper brings about on this record is about as potent as a Macy’s Calvin Klein styrofoam mannequin torso. The track “Anxiety” bends to the trend of making notable references and building song topics around the mental hell that some people face on a daily basis. “You give me anxiety,” followed by some cheap, dollar store quality bubble bass drops and glitched, annoying vocalizations give no true experience, storytelling quality, or feeling for listeners. There’s nothing more repugnant or disgusting than taking the true experiences of a mental illness for garbage, trendy, and basic music. Matter of fact, blackbear has the guts to claim that he “sets trends” on the track “Bright Pink Tims,” a claim so ridiculous and so preposterous that anyone who can bring themselves about to believe such a fib would probably claim that Santa is still going to bring them their Call of Duty game for Christmas. (Hey, I’m not bagging on you Santa, you fucking rock). The putrid howls that pour out of this empty husk of an “artist” give no reason for letting up or going easy on the record. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is, aesthetically, no reference or slight construction of a world around, and the beats give room for creativity to do so, but blackbear would rather remind you that he wakes up with money and gets paid to perform. After listening to this watered down, substance-less record, one gets the premonition that, “Yea, sure, maybe blackbear is an industry plant, a meat puppet, set abound to make as much money as possible before he is replaced with the next faceless meat puppet in line.” It’s cruel to consider such a thing, but not once on this soul forsaken album does blackbear make reference to his personality, his well being, his personal life, his upbringing, his hometown, his aspirations. Fuck no, blackbear would rather let you know that he has fucked the same women that Chris Brown, Jared Leto, Lil Uzi Vert, G-Eazy, etc., have fucked. Apparently, like his album, blackbear loves to revel in leftovers. Blackbear loves being the subpar, unoriginal carcass that provides empty aesthetic via edgy album art, and not much else. Sitting through \u003ci\u003ecybersex\u003c/i\u003e, which again, great edgy album name, is like sitting through the leftovers of every single trap artist from 2010 to the present day; and all these leftovers are cold and have mold growing on them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e#basicbitchmusic/10\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1nXBX3wP3DQgwpqvVtJl8H\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e",

Co-signed to Tyler, The Creator, Banes World is a rising star in the Los Angeles indie pop scene, known for his hazy jazz-tinged tunes. A considerable number of fervent fans showed up to see him play, and many audience members sang along word-for-word to several of his songs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e The overarching theme of his performance was lush tones accompanying dispirited lyrics about love and longing. Popular tracks like “Drowsy” and “You Say I’m in Love” were extremely well received, and Blanchard had the opportunity to showcase his guitar skills with refreshing hints of both blues and jazz lingering in the instrumentals. Vocally, Blanchard had impressive control and a superb smooth tone that emoted an air of nostalgia. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy the time Knox Fortune took the stage, the room was filled with both curiosity and excitement. He is most notable for producing tracks for Vic Mensa and co-producing Joey Purp’s \u003ci\u003eiiiDrops\u003c/i\u003e mixtape, but rose to solo prominence for singing the hook on Chance the Rapper’s “All Night.” However, aside from a quick thirty second snippet of “All Night” to get the crowd moving, this show primarily featured his first solo album \u003ci\u003eParadise\u003c/i\u003e, revealing Knox as an upbeat, indie pop artist. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe performance exuded liveliness and excitement; Knox made an effort to maintain a spirited atmosphere that complimented his light, synth-based beats. However, in many songs, including “I Don’t Wanna Talk About it” and “Seaglass,” the vocal backing tracks were quite overbearing and it became difficult to pinpoint the actual live vocals. “Help Myself” was a fun, airy electro-pop tune, but unfortunately the vocals throughout the night were quite pitchy and slightly off. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHaving listened to \u003ci\u003eParadise\u003c/i\u003e prior to the show, the vocals seemed considerably modified in the studio version with heavy effects, which accounted for the disparities heard during the live show. The songs “Torture” and “Keep You Close” were particularly pitchy, but did show definite signs of potential as catchy pop tunes with mass media appeal. “24 Hours” too showcased Knox’s bouncy beats mixed with fuzzy vocals and carefree lyrics. By far his best performance was “Lil Thing”—a sweet, breezy mix that supplemented his high pitched, effeminate vocals. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, \u003ci\u003eParadise\u003c/i\u003e is a lighthearted encapsulation of pop tinged with synth, electronic and even a bit of rock; Knox Fortune provides a lively and sincere stage presence that is refreshing to see. With a serious effort to improve live vocals, or incorporate more audio effects as heard in the studio versions, he could quite possibly possess the tools for creating a popular act. \u003c/p\u003e",

Since their debut in 2010, the duo Brian Oblivion and Madeline Follin have released three albums, temporarily broke up as a band (and as a couple), and are now embarking on a nationwide tour.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLA was the second of three Southern California stops The Cults made. The day before, The Cults visited Santa Ana at the Constellation Room, where lead singer Follin noticed several dedicated fans who came back for the second show. Their dedication didn’t go to waste, as two special surprises happened at The Cult’s LA show. First, The Cults debuted the trippy and surreal music video for their song “Right Words” off of \u003ci\u003eOffering\u003c/i\u003e. Second, the crowd also got the chance to celebrate Follin’s birthday where everyone sang-along as Follin was gifted with an adorable donut decorated cake.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e76d5cccba149f14db916fe0127a311b/tumblr_inline_ozqg4qAMZV1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe band played hits primarily from their latest album \u003ci\u003eOffering\u003c/i\u003e. The upbeat and whimsical songs, a departure from the darker tones of their 2013 album \u003ci\u003eStatic\u003c/i\u003e, were accompanied with a colorful projection backdrop that illuminated Follin, Oblivion, and the rest of the band. When it was time for the crowd to finally go outside, The Cults appropriately ended their set with their breakout hit “Go Outside” to close off the night. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"4377\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2c759d1cb52ada786d351e988d6b9c63/tumblr_inline_ozqg4rQRwq1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"4377\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

Let’s get significantly stupid. It’s gonna be fun.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI knew exactly what I was walking into with this self titled Lil Pump tape. The youngest flexer at only 19 years old from Miami, Florida arrives on his purple, lean soaked jet ski to deliver a series of short, focused, pummeling and overbearing trap anthems for anyone ready to get extremely stupid. It is extremely safe to say that Lil Pump is definitely not staying in a unique lane, as the teen stays well within the boring boundaries that trap has established for the last ten years or so. Cocaine, Balmains, wild sex, and a whole lot of overdone, layered ad-libs find a cozy home on this tape. It is not anything that is meant to challenge a listener; it is a tape that fits snuggly in the current SoundCloud landscape alongside other unconditional names like XXXTentacion, Ski Mask the Slump God and Smokepurpp (who also finds himself spitting incessantly annoying ad-libs all over this record). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn terms of production, the tired, SoundCloud formulas are repeated: overblown bass, sometimes to the point of being overwhelmingly distorted and suffocating, runs underneath repeated, atonal instrumental riffs provided by bells or spooky sounding synths and trap style drum production. The beats do not vary distinctly on many of the cuts found on this tape. It is evident that Lil Pump knows exactly what he is dealing with, who his audience is, and what they are so thirsty to take in. He keeps his features relatively sedated, as most of them fail to outperform and outshine the youngster on his own tape. Lil Yachty on “Back” reminds us once again that he is capable of rapping on tempo, while Gucci Mane stays collected and supportive on “Youngest Flexer.” In fact, the pairing could be some kind of torch passing moment, as Gucci Mane’s repetitive and slouched demeanor fits as a polar opposite to the energy and noisy presentation Lil Pump comes through with. It is easy to personally prefer the lyrics that Lil Pump delivers when paired alongside the sleepy coma that Gucci Mane woke up from. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe fact that the original songs that Lil Pump blew up with are found on this tape is a little disappointing, but aside from this matter the tape proves to be an enjoyable, sugary pill of stupidity. It is a tape that annoys if one allows themselves to be annoyed by it. It serves the purpose that not many rappers are prepared to take on in a natural sense; Lil Pump naturally fits this bill. Everything from the production to the vocals and lyrics fulfill their intended tasks, and Lil Pump’s enthusiasm for xanax and “thots” never lets up during the duration of the entire project. It is something to throw on when the cares in the world are long gone and the night is ready to be torn up. Songs like “Molly,” “Boss,” and “Gucci Gang” stay consistent and ridiculous; Songs like “Flex Like Ouu” and “D Rose” were produced with obviously lower budgets but still present a reminder as to why Lil Pump is able to bring listeners an entire tape ready to tear foundations out of apartment parties and entire suspensions out of vehicles. “Iced Out” probably wins the award for best, most balanced, and easy to stomach beat, as the bass is just slightly understated and the popping mallets all over the beat add a distinct texture to the track. Yet the considerations truly make one wonder how long this repeated process can go on and whether or not the kid has any staying power after this tape. It is evident that Lil Pump sticks to his guns, but how many guns does the kid have left upon releasing this project?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you know what Lil Pump’s mantra is, and it annoys you just knowing that this kid exists, this is your warning: stay the fuck away from this nonsense. It is not a tape for the hip hop traditionalist, bound on reminding the world that nothing will ever be able to put blasphemy on the temple of Wu Tang or the beat finessings of Madlib. It is a tape to throw on when you’re next up on the aux rotation in the Corolla and your friends are desperately looking for an excuse to yell obscenities out of the window at bored-out-of-their-mind pedestrians. It is a tape to throw on when the sky is as purple as the lean you wish you could drink if it weren’t such a fucking destructive heroin in liquid form. It is the tape to throw on to get your friend awake out of the xanax induced coma they put themselves in. It is the tape to throw on when you get that paycheck and want to feel livid on the way to the bank. Other than this, this thing is as dumb as a can of soup.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e6/10\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Their set was one of the highlights of both my summers attending the festival, which says a lot considering the immense quality of the bands that play ArcTanGent. Yet the most striking thing about the festival as a whole isn’t the music, but the community and camaraderie surrounding it, which was made especially clear towards the end of Alpha Male Tea Party’s set. Prior to the band’s final song, guitarist Tom Peters took a moment to address the absence of a key figure within the math rock and ArcTanGent scene, Dan Wild-Beesley, who was most commonly known around the festival as the former guitarist of Cleft, a band which had played every prior year of ArcTanGent including their final show as a band at last year’s festival. Dan also happens to be in a new band with Tom called GUG and is also Tom’s best friend. It had been announced several months prior that Dan, who was first diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2015 and had been in remission for almost 2 years, would be unable to attend the festival or play with GUG as his tumor had returned along with a second inoperable one on his cerebellum. I personally came to know Dan under the unlikeliest and most unfortunate of circumstances when I was in the midst of my own battle with cancer. Since then, the impact he has had on my life has been ineffable and I know there are hundreds of people who could speak at length about how Dan has touched their lives both as a musician and as an incredible human being. When I interviewed Dan at ArcTanGent \u003ca href=\"http://uclaradio.tumblr.com/post/151015591414/talking-tangents-and-fond-farewells-with-dan\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elast year\u003c/a\u003e, he mentioned Tom and Alpha Male Tea Party multiple times as being his best friends and “a fucking awesome band as well.” In my interview with Alpha Male Tea Party this summer, they too spoke at length of their love of Dan and the massive hole that they felt from him not being able to attend the festival. Before I get into that interview, I wanted to first let you hear from Tom about Dan, his illness, and how you can help to support him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-height=\"640\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/171bc5e95e5d42e6bf7b3572e0beae54/tumblr_inline_oz42e09IW61qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-height=\"640\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhoto Credit: Trash Monkey\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eLayla: \u003c/b\u003eYou guys did something really special at the end of your set and obviously we’re all gutted about Dan not being here and GUG [not being able to perform] as well. When I spoke with Dan at ArcTanGent last year he talked a lot about your friendship and Cleft’s relationship with Alpha Male Tea Party. Do you want to talk about that and the fundraiser that you’ve got going on?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eTom:\u003c/b\u003e I need to just say that Dan as a person has never at any point let [cancer] control him or let it stop him from being or doing what he wanted to do, and that’s an amazing testament to Dan as a person. He’s a wonderful guy. He’s my best friend, I was the best man at his wedding. There’s so many wonderful memories I have with Dan and I wish that he wasn’t going through what he’s going through. But he’s dealing with it in the best way that he possibly can and that’s amazing. He’s had various different types of treatment and I think he’s at that point where he needs to [be] looking at alternatives. So at the moment we’re trying to raise a bit of money so that he can go and do a specialist treatment out in Istanbul. The treatment has shown an 80% success rate of pushing cancer patients into remission. So we want to try and raise enough money that Dan can go and get that treatment. It’s a really amazing program that they have over there. It’s a combined treatment including well-being and dietary stuff as well as a really amazing groundbreaking chemotherapy program that uses targeted chemotherapy. And, your know he’s 32. He deserves that and I think all we can do is help him, all I want to do. So there will be a JustGiving set up so anyone that’s not at the festival right now can donate in some way. I mean obviously when we played earlier I made the point that there’s 5,000 people [at ArcTanGent]. If everyone put a tenner in, that’s it covered.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo read more of Dan’s story and offer whatever support you can, please \u003ca href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/danbeatcancer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edonate\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-height=\"640\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/30750750b65d22c290637650849b41f6/tumblr_inline_oz42fvyByo1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-height=\"640\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhoto Credit: Trash Monkey; (from left) Ben Griffiths (bass), Greg Chapman (drums), Tom Peters (guitar)\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAugust 18, 2017 - Fernhill Farm, Bristol, UK\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eLayla: \u003c/b\u003eI do want to start by saying, I had so much fun at the set today.

I mean, we played Trowbridge on Wednesday night in this tiny room. It was really small. It was still a really fun gig but it was the contrast between playing in this tiny room where we were going, “Is there actually enough room for us to get our equipment on the stage?” We ended up playing on the floor because we couldn’t actually get it in place.

But over the summer my friend and I who I would co-host my radio show with would plan playlists and [after listening to the new album] I just texted him: “Whatever you do, do not listen to the Alpha Male Tea Party album. You need to hear it right then and there [on the show] because I want to be there and see your face when you are listening to it.” So that is the highest honor, when I tell my friend not to listen to it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eT: \u003c/b\u003eThat’s really nice to hear. It’s definitely been a fucking huge labor of love for us. Because we self-produce everything. I’m a recording engineer by trade so I’ve done all the recording and mixing and stuff like that. So for me, I can’t tell if I absolutely hate it or love it still.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eB: \u003c/b\u003eI love it, as a man who’s on the outside of that kind of spectrum.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eT:\u003c/b\u003e Yeah, it can be challenging when you do your own production.

Because a lot had happened. What we’ve done with this record is try and translate how we are feeling about the world and our personal situations into music more than we have done before. So it was different. We made more of an effort to really concentrate on the writing in places. It was harder to write. It took a lot longer than we expected.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eG:\u003c/b\u003e But it was written in one lump whereas [the band’s previous album] Droids was written in various lumps and recorded in various lumps. Health was written in one lump and recorded in one lump. So it was a much more manageable process and a very enjoyable process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eT: \u003c/b\u003eYeah, it was. When we got into the thick of it, it was a really good. I loved writing the songs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eG:\u003c/b\u003e We went off to Oxfordshire into the country in the middle of winter and holed ourselves up in a little studio and it was lovely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1340\" data-orig-height=\"894\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/67ac19eba66cbc7532891758388a3320/tumblr_inline_oz42iwL5v51qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1340\" data-orig-height=\"894\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhoto Credit: Jonathan Dadds\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eL: \u003c/b\u003eI don’t know if this is just my own personal weird sense of humor, but I’ve found there to be a lot of humor in math rock and among math rock bands. Would you agree?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eB: \u003c/b\u003eI think there has to be because there’s very little lyrics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eL:\u003c/b\u003e Yeah, it just doesn’t take itself as seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eB:\u003c/b\u003e Absolutely. Well, there are certain math rock bands that take themselves incredibly seriously. But the ones that have longevity are, I think, the ones that don’t really care and will just laugh about it. I think the perfect example of this is a band called Future of the Left. They’re not a math rock band at all but they play math rock festivals all the time because their music’s a bit on the odd side. But they’ve got this sense of humor which appeals to a lot of people and their lyrics are fantastic. I think humor is, for us it’s used to process the world and I think for a lot of people it’s used to display personality. Because we’re not, as people, we are not posers. We laugh at everything. And [Tom] said it really well in an interview before, it would be wrong of us if we did anything else. It would be untruthful to our own personalities. Because we are massive piss-takers. But to the point that we don’t take a piss with our music. We take our music very seriously. The song titles are an opportunity for a band like us to kind of go, “Ah, fuck it. Let’s use that hilarious thing you shouted at me in a bar in Edinburgh once.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eT:\u003c/b\u003e It’s as much as a coping mechanism as well as anything else. Some people express themselves in totally different ways and everybody has to try and find a way to express themselves as naturally as they possibly can. For us, humor is the way to do it. It wouldn’t necessarily feel right for us to not be, you know, on a personal level and this is the thing that I think sometimes is a little bit of a misunderstanding like, our music isn’t funny music. We take the writing of our songs very seriously and the emotional meaning of all of our music is very serious to us because a lot of the time it is about us translating the way that we are particularly feeling about something awful into something creative.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eL:\u003c/b\u003e Do you guys have a favorite memory of any of the years you’ve played ArcTanGent?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eG:\u003c/b\u003e What we’ve just done was the best.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eT:\u003c/b\u003e I have to make special exception because \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzB8NhvVNHM\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe riff medley with Cleft\u003c/a\u003e is a moment that will never be surpassed.

Released June 16 under license by Warner Bros Records, the album consists of 12 songs and is roughly 40 minutes in duration. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNotoriously political, Earle adapts to the rigid, formulaic song structure expected of major label country music. Earle’s raspy “talk tone” voice, paired with traditional country instruments such as fiddles, an array of guitars, and Waylon Jennings timbre, set his album apart from the popular country pack. Memorable tracks include “So You Wannabe An Outlaw,” which showcases exceptionally arranged instrumentation and lyrics retrospective of his renegade years. “This Is How it Ends,” featuring a duet with Miranda Lambert, is my favorite track on the album. A compelling song about divorce, it features savory harmony and well-written lyrics. “Goodbye Michelangelo,” the final track, pays tribute to Guy Clark, Earle’s former mentor. Its simple instrumentation highlights its emotional message. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, I’d recommend Earle’s latest album to country fans, especially those over 30 years old, who seek to expand their musical palate.  Earle, 62, has a very devoted fan base, and continues to sell out live shows nationwide.\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

The collaboration presented Kozelek’s narrative lyricism over Broadrick’s metal-centered guitar melodies. While it was a collaboration I was skeptical about during its release, Kozelek and Broadrick certainly complemented each other and present a melding between “soft” lyrics and “harsh” instrumentation that made the album one of the best collaborations to date in its innovation and surprising ability to balance two completely different genres. Now, a year later, fans of Kozelek, Broadrick, and the J\u003ci\u003eesu/Sun Kil Moon\u003c/i\u003e collaboration are met again with a collaboration between the two in \u003ci\u003e30 Seconds to the Decline of Planet Earth\u003c/i\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSimilarly to the \u003ci\u003eJesu/Sun Kil Moon\u003c/i\u003e album, \u003ci\u003e30 Seconds\u003c/i\u003e takes both artists in a new direction. \u003ci\u003e30 Seconds\u003c/i\u003e, however, is less concerned with the jarring appeal of harsh metal-based guitar sounds, and instead focuses on glimmering and positive synth melodies and quiet, almost trip-hop sounding beats. In fact, the album has no metal influence at all, and sounds more similar to Kozelek’s other work, including\u003ci\u003e Common as Light and Love are Red Valleys of Blood\u003c/i\u003e, released earlier this year— both in its underlying beats, as well as Kozelek’s lyrics focusing on both his own life in songs like “You Are Me and I Am You,” discussing his relationship with his father, and “The Greatest Conversation Ever in the History of the Universe,” ranting about the current American political climate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInnovation aside, there is some musical and lyrical skill that is sacrificed in \u003ci\u003e30 Seconds\u003c/i\u003e. At times the electronica is dull-sounding, even though it is bright on the surface, and the lyrics are mediocre when compared to Kozelek’s other poignant work that simply outshines the concepts he discusses on this album. I am hesitant to say this is the result of the fact that the album is a collaboration, because \u003ci\u003eJesu/Sun Kil Moon\u003c/i\u003e was so impressive, as was Kozelek’s 2013 collaboration with Jimmy Lavalle. Instead, perhaps this is the result of Kozelek producing two full-length albums within the last year, and the creative burnout that may result.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat being said, the album has its own pretty and tender moments that show Kozelek’s autobiographical appeal in his music, as well as Broadrick’s skill in instrumentation. While \u003ci\u003e30 Seconds\u003c/i\u003e is not as impressive as \u003ci\u003eJesu/Sun Kil Moon\u003c/i\u003e or Kozelek’s other releases, it is worth appreciation regardless, as its moments of innovation make it a worthwhile listen, even at 70 minutes in length.\u003c/p\u003e",

LIB is not your typical festival. It goes above and beyond a traditional music festival experience through its incorporation of art, yoga and guest speakers to not only entertain you but to provide you with some food for thought during this weekend of soul searching. The first thing that stood out to me about LIB was the attendees. Everyone at Lightning in a Bottle is there for a reason that goes way beyond partying.

You’ll feel completely cut off from the rest of civilization, in a world of serene tranquility and smiling faces. The breathtaking views are contrasted beautifully with intricate art and light displays set up all around the stages.

People gathered around in a small tent, laying on the ground and practicing yoga poses to pulsing bass and trippy visuals. But if you do go out and explore all night, make sure you still get up early enough for some morning yoga or check out the 33 singing bowls ceremony at 8am. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1365\" data-orig-width=\"2048\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8c8552d62190109641b8eb346ae0459a/tumblr_inline_o9g4hvWCDT1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1365\" data-orig-width=\"2048\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhoto by Jacob Avanzato\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you haven’t been to a Do-Lab event, you need to put that at the top of your to-do list.

This single off of the album is my absolute favorite, and it\u0026rsquo;s a feature track with Alunageorge and Goldlink. Aluna Francis of Alunageorge is one of the sweetest vocalists around right now, and her voice smoothly glides over the funky beat. Goldlink, well-known for being a member of the Soulection crew, has a fast, down-to-earth verse that shuffles through the middle of the song. This clean edit allows the pure warmth to be felt, and takes a little of the grit that Goldlink raps off of the feel of the track. It does a good job of juxtaposing a very masculine energy with Aluna\u0026rsquo;s delicate melody, kinda like what Andre 3000 of Outkast does really well.

There are even a few tracks which dip into having elements of Rockabilly music, which was really sweet alongside many songs with some good shredding. Rob Caggiano has been with the band for a while, coming from famous Thrash metal band, \u0026ldquo;Anthrax.\u0026rdquo; Seal the Deal was familiar to me from their Coachella performance this year, and has arguably the most power in the album. Another really great song was the final track, \u0026ldquo;The Loas Crossroad,\u0026rdquo; which finishes the album on a really epic note. It even uses a dude playing the bagpipes in the last minute, I was NOT expecting that!

The series isn’t so trite as to\ndepict an Orwellian dictatorship, but instead paints a future polluted by capitalism run amok. The\nsocial commentary is basic situation and not thematic—each episode focuses on struggle and\ncharacter. Of course, the characters are degraded like the city they call home; the theme\npermeates the setting. It is the theme of the future. Lurking obelisks dominate the Gotham City\nlandscape, each tower covered in glyphs resembling Asiatic characters. Bruce Wayne, pillar of\nAmerican exceptionalism and justice is old and weak.

They started off lo-fi and scuzzy on their 2013 debut, polished up on Wild Onion, and here they\u0026rsquo;ve added more diverse instrumentation to their classic-rock/punk hybrid sound. They pay homage to their rock heroes here by including bah-bah-bah-bah\u0026rsquo;s lifted straight from the Velvet Underground\u0026rsquo;s Who Loves the Sun and riffs that sound exactly like T.Rex.

This project sounds unmistakingly like it was recorded entirely in a closet of a one-bedroom apartment, with soft, consistent static and very pretty quiet vocals and simple guitar. Some of the songs teeter the edge between lo-fi and a middle school girl singing over her siblings\u0026rsquo; guitar riffs. This being said, the project seems self aware of this and even embraces the innocence and intimacy of the style, and in doing so actually creates a somewhat fascinating sound.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

On EP Collection, she has songs with and without vocals, but both kinds are equally good. \u0026ldquo;By the Polo Pond\u0026rdquo; really experiments with vocals and a stripped version of dream pop. \u0026ldquo;And Sooner Than We Know It\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; has no vocals but the samples that she use tell a story of their own, even without a vocal narration.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eJared Illiad \u003cbr/\u003eRecommended Song: Hustle or Fall\u003cbr/\u003eGenre: hip hop\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eLyrically meaningful and deeply personal songs.

The two British artists, both clad in Miami Vice pastel suits and crisp white loafers as they took the stage April 20, offer a kind of sound that is distinctly Hollywood, evocative of mobsters, spies, and the seedy underbelly of the city. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" data-orig-width=\"2448\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9208d828ec2243d98ee8fc341e05644e/tumblr_inline_o6mmj1b3UX1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3264\" data-orig-width=\"2448\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eTheir newest album and the second they’ve released together, Everything You’ve Come To Expect, provided most of the material of their setlist, along with a few hits from their debut The Age of the Understatement. The opening chords of each song was met with a roar of recognition from the crowd. Kane and Turner don’t waste time with banter between songs. Every now and then, they belted out an obligatory “LOS ANGELES, BABY!!” that sends the crowd into uproar. They instead allowed each song to speak for itself, cinematic in its scope both lyrically and musically. Backed by a small string quartet (in addition to the standard drums and bass guitar), every song could easily be the musical opening to a 007 movie.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Theatre at Ace Hotel is just as dramatic as the Last Shadow Puppets themselves, with gothic high ceilings like the Sagrada Familia and velvet seats like earliest days of the movie industry.

There was no moment of quiet, no slowing down of the theatrics. Each song only ratcheted up the energy in the room, and by the end all of us were wanting more. Truly a historic show, I can only hope it isn’t long until the Last Shadow Puppets return to their new home.\u003c/p\u003e",

track listing, and repeatedly changed the album’s name, cover art, and release date.  The result was an unexpected series of memes involving anyone from casual fans, to big name corporations like Burger King and even Nintendo mimicking West’s baffling social media behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the album was finally released, the final track list boasted an 18 song set as opposed to the original 10 that West promised with his first handwritten track listings.  Even if West hadn’t made every single edit public knowledge, this sudden dumping of tracks would have been easily apparent, especially given the lack of cohesion that ultimately characterizes the final product.  Many Kanye stans have, and will continue to argue that this album\u0026rsquo;s blatant \u0026ldquo;messiness\u0026rdquo; is purposeful given the project\u0026rsquo;s namesake, but unlike a Picasso painting, this LP isn\u0026rsquo;t actually greater than the sum of its parts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe parts themselves are a mixed bag: Clashing sound changes, underutilized features, and the occasional ill-placed transitional piece make this a difficult record to predict, or really define under any singular concept.\u003ci\u003e  The Life of Pablo\u003c/i\u003e opens incredibly strong, however.  The sound on “Ultralight Beam” is distinctively Kanye in its grandiose aesthetic while also delivering on his promise on this album being a bit of a gospel record.  There’s also a Kelly Price feature on this song that goes over remarkably well, and by the end the reigns are dropped into Chance the Rapper’s lap, who, delivers a fantastic and altogether comforting performance to round the song out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first part of \u0026ldquo;Father Stretch My Hands” begins inoffensively enough as a followup, but quickly plummets into this lousy juxtaposition between avant-garde and immaturity that fails to come together in any meaningful sense.  This track is also known for containing the now infamous “bleached asshole” line which is only more cringeworthy in execution than it is on paper.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Famous” is actually fairly decent track, even if all the credit goes to the dynamic production propping it up.  The climbing chords and satisfying vocal samples near the end almost make me forgive the bizarre line implicating that Taylor Swift owes Kanye sex for making her famous.  From very early on, it’s apparent that Kanye\u0026rsquo;s new brand of verisimilitude will only appeal to fans that find Kanye West fascinating outside of the context of this album.  \u003ci\u003eThe Life of Pablo\u003c/i\u003e after all, is just as mixed and flawed as the persona West has been perpetuating ever since \u003ci\u003eMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\u003c/i\u003e.  There’s no sin in pushing an over-the-top personality, but the problem this album suffers from is that it demands to be taken seriously while simultaneously insulting you for looking too deep into lyrics about having a GoPro for a penis.  It\u0026rsquo;s easy to be obnoxious, and wholly acceptable to be profound—The real challenge is being both, and it\u0026rsquo;s a challenge \u003ci\u003eThe Life of Pablo\u003c/i\u003e doesn\u0026rsquo;t particularly succeed in.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA track like “Low Lights” for example, is evidence that this album takes itself a lot more seriously than it objectively is.  It\u0026rsquo;s a dramatic two minute transition in a series of tracks that don\u0026rsquo;t carry much of a tangible narrative or theme to begin with.  But despite this mostly dissatisfying first half, the album hits a bit of a positive streak beginning with \u0026quot;FML.\u0026rdquo;  The progression between this track, \u0026ldquo;Real Friends,\u0026rdquo; and “Wolves\u0026quot; is seamless and actually pretty refreshing to listen to.  I can’t say I\u0026rsquo;m totally in love with “FML,” but the Weeknd feature feels very natural, and for the first time in several minutes, we’re getting a cohesive track from beginning to end.  “Real Friends” is definitely one of the highlights of this project, featuring a very spacious beat, and well-written verses detailing everything from disingenuous relationships to having an overall askance approach to everyday life.  The track closes and immediately gives way to “Wolves,” which is eerily strung along by a vocal sample that sits somewhere between a wail and somber howl.  This is a decent track overall, even if the Biblical parallels and lyric about a stolen sandwich warrant a bit of an eye roll at first.  Despite this, you can’t help but appreciate that you’re finally getting the most earnest and serious version of Kanye possible, even if it’s just for a few fleeting moments. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, this hot streak of tracks hits an abrupt end with the meandering \u0026ldquo;30 Hours.”  The song begins solid enough—adopting a very casual autobiographical approach, kind of sounding like Mark Kozelek if he took up rapping.  But by the two and half minute mark, “30 Hours” has no business existing.  Kanye insists that all the best songs ride out this way, but all he accomplishes here is accentuating the fact that his best tracks are the ones that have a cohesive plan behind them. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI definitely don\u0026rsquo;t have a problem with experimentation in rap music, but unless experimental hip hop begins and ends with abrasive sounds and auto tune, then it\u0026rsquo;s apparent that Kanye West still hasn\u0026rsquo;t figured out how to do it very well.  I do think the sounds are more varied and even a little more challenging than they were on \u003ci\u003eYeezus\u003c/i\u003e, but the end result is only \u0026quot;cutting edge\u0026rdquo; in that it appeals to a very surface level of alternative sounds.  At times I feel like the music is still so self obsessed that it finds more interest in the act of experimenting than in actually making a quality song.  The closing track, “Fade,” is a perfect example of this.  Kanye hardly has any meaningful presence in it whatsoever, and he has certain sounds and samples popping in and out of the track without any tact or particular reason.  Ultimately it’s a pretty lackluster closer, while simultaneously serving as a frank reminder of the mess you just experienced.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven if it fails to be especially compelling by the eighteenth track, I can give the album credit for holding the listener’s attention through and through.  There\u0026rsquo;s something uniquely fascinating about listening to Kanye when he\u0026rsquo;s left to his own devices.  Unfortunately the results aren’t always as interesting as West thinks they are—The concept of making a messy album just isn\u0026rsquo;t revolutionary.  More important still is the fact that the rewarding moments on this LP don’t magically elevate the lazier ones just because we’re getting a mixed bag.  \u003ci\u003eThe Life of Pablo\u003c/i\u003e simply plays like a rough mixtape, and not the concept album its being marketed as.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs of writing this review, fans are currently hard at work rearranging the track last into more digestible, or even sensible pieces—hoping a masterful album lies underneath.  I will not attest to \u003ci\u003eThe Life of Pablo\u003c/i\u003e being the \u003ci\u003eBlade Runner\u003c/i\u003e of rap albums, but I will admit my sympathy for those desperately clinging to the waning brilliance of the “Old Kanye™.\u0026ldquo;\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

The venue was a contrast to the more typical underground venues in how polished it was – think if the Ace Hotel threw a warehouse show. The windows overlooked an industrial yard with wooden palettes stacked so high they were reminiscent of something straight from a Dr. Seuss book. There were funny little indications that the space was somebody’s apartment, like the rack of clothing that had been left out, the couches and chairs that created intimate spaces for socializing, and kitchenette. These details quietly demanded a respect for the space most evident in how smokers self-relegated to a smaller room off the main space the whole night.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2032\" data-orig-height=\"1354\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9222ec075a51661ad4efcfdbad5ae9df/tumblr_inline_o2fzfybHjF1qhakxc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2032\" data-orig-height=\"1354\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2036\" data-orig-height=\"1354\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b58ecfe67b57ddd6f037890758185126/tumblr_inline_o2fzg5A9AH1qhakxc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2036\" data-orig-height=\"1354\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://philiprugo.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePhilip Rugo\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://ruthbabyy.tumblr.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBabyyruth\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/blvckmxtr/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBlvckmxtr\u003c/a\u003e, all three of whom rep UCLA’s Design Media Arts program, created the night’s visual installations.

This variance is fun when people – like the middle-aged man I saw getting down in a sparkly fedora – still hold respect for the music, space, and other people attending.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2028\" data-orig-height=\"1356\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9383e0287ba8d500359459ee56732a0d/tumblr_inline_o2fzxiDU9M1qhakxc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2028\" data-orig-height=\"1356\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2036\" data-orig-height=\"1356\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c816ca76fc064282fbd74346aefb38ea/tumblr_inline_o2fzxjU4Fs1qhakxc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2036\" data-orig-height=\"1356\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eOlin started off with funkier house and proceeded to bust out a versatile set that covered a large swath of house sub-genres with a few brief forays into deep techno.

His exceptionally youthful energy and excitement radiated through his music and presence. Instead of feeding off of the audience, he seemed to be breathing his own life and freshness into us. Towards the end of his set, he stood up on a chair and danced, waving his arms above his head and smiling with carefree serenity. This was the first stop on his North American tour and his first visit to Los Angeles.

This league is a business, and even though Roger Goodell claims to remove the Pro Bowl if the quality of play isn’t sufficient, he’s lying. He’ll remove the game when it no longer turns a profit. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd I’m sure the game still does with all of it’s promotions and commercial advertisements—granted, I SWEAR I saw that Alec Baldwin and Dan Marino commercial like 30 times.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd yes, players are turning the game now more than ever before, but a lot of great young talent still came out to play to the game.

The DJ booth had two potted palm plants on either side of it and sported a textured white cloth hanging over the front. White fabric was draped from the ceiling culminating in one central point, under which was hung a disco ball. They had set up a minimal projection out into the crowd and a few lasers pointed at the disco ball.

After midnight he set the tone for the evening with his infamous Libyan disco tunes. This era featured slower tempos with vocals bordering on RnB and featuring tribal flutes and Latin Percussion. This progressed into a deep rabbit hole of education from the man, leading the night into a dance filled frenzy of heavy synth, disco influenced, eclectic house with some borderline techno-sounding tracks.

It was an interesting choice to have such an incredible sound system but not have it flexing on a level representative of even half of what it was capable of. For the first three hours of the night there was little to no low end, to the point where I held a conversation with someone two feet away from me at a regular speaking level.

Since the venue was relatively small for a warehouse, the outdoor smoking area was packed, which was an ideal environment for socializing with the somewhat bizarre assortment of people who had been drawn to the show. There was a Seth-Rogen looking dude clad in flip flops, basketball shorts, and a grey tee who looked like he’s just rolled out of his dorm room into this underground electronic scene. There was a gay cat donning a leather vest with zippers, tight leans, and flashy monochrome sneakers. A lot of the girls there looked like they had just finished shopping at Melrose trading post. Perhaps the most intriguing character, however, was the large African-american man dressed in all black with flo$$y jewelry posted up in a fold-up chair in the smoking area all night who would occasionally get up to buy more beers to keep underneath his seat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe lights came on around 5AM and people poured onto the industrial streets, waiting for rides home as the sun came up. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFar Away throws underground parties in Los Angeles and has a monthly radio show on  Gr in addition to being a touring agency, mix series, tape label, and DJ crew.

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By\u003c/i\u003e: Conner Lund, UCLA Radio News DJ (02/02/16)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring President Obama’s State of the Union address, Obama hinted at the current primary politics of the nation, as the new political atmosphere becomes clearer on who’s in line for the position of President. It seems apparent from pop culture how big of a deal the election cycle is, which will culminate in 2016 yet has been popularized now by candidates such as Donald Trump and the quick surge of Bernie Sanders. In his speech, Obama made comments about certain issues in the election cycle, with undertones that dealt with specific topics Donald Trump said in recent news, specifically regarding an anti-Muslim stance Trump has taken up. Although Obama did a good job at shying away from confronting this issue, Representative Paul Ryan was more than frustrated at the tone Obama used when confronting the issue, claiming that it’s “not what presidents ought to be talking about in State of the Union addresses.\u0026ldquo; But why can’t the president discuss the current state of the US political system, if it is such an integral part of not only our reputation domestically but our reputation abroad? How do these issues reflect on the US? \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009In a world where the US has not only the strongest military but also the strongest cultural influence in the world, how can we justify such statements when our big reputation is on the line? Our culture and society spreads to all reaches of the globe as a leader in creating the cultural climate. In his speech, Obama discussed the entirety of the current state of the world, ranging from climate change to health care. This comment that has been condemned by Paul Ryan, however, holds massive weight in not only affecting the political system here with Donald Trump and the Republican race, but massive weight abroad. How can we claim such cultural superiority when we have a business tycoon making national headlines, claiming absurd things that don’t represent our country accurately? It frightens me that somehow Donald Trump has had a huge effect on our international image, but all for the wrong reasons. Instead of promoting the ideas of honest democracy and open dialogue, a message the US continually tries to spread throughout the world, Trump has systematically destroyed the image of American politics. He has claimed politically incorrect things, has slandered other candidates, and has promoted xenophobia against Muslims, which is one of the leading international issues today with the turmoil in the Middle East. Obama’s speech was, in my mind, meant to discuss where we are in a realist view, not only the good, but also much of the bad and the places to improve. When I see where the US is going, it scares me. It scares me that people like Trump have so much weight in this world. It scares me that we let him have so much weight in this world. It scares me that Paul Ryan didn’t want to address the issue. It scares me more that the world wants this issue addressed. Since the Arab Spring, the US has played an instrumental role, whether for better or worse, in establishing and promoting Democracy and American ideals. But what happens when these core pillars, for which we have tried to build the world on, collapses? What happens when Democracy becomes dependent on money and business? What happens when the ideals and values of candidates degrades; yet the poles reflect the opposite? What worries me is that these issues that all seem to be domestic really have an outward effect on the world. That other countries turn to America for cultural norms and values. All of these issues Obama brought up scare me, and yet what scares me more is that other politicians were scared by his message, not for the sake of the world reputation, but for the sake of their own. \u003c/p\u003e",

cold-blooded fashion to force overtime.  \u003cbr/\u003eIn the extra period, the Clippers again struggled to close out the shorthanded Pelicans.  After Paul hit a long three with 1:15 remaining to put them up three, Crawford, Luc Richard Mbah a Moute, and Wesley Johnson combined to clank three clutch free throws in the final minute to give the Pelicans new life again.  But Ryan Anderson, who finished with 16 points and 10 rebounds in the spot start for Davis, missed a stepback three at the buzzer that would have re-tied the game, and the Clippers escaped.  \u003cbr/\u003eClippers head coach Doc Rivers wasn’t entirely pleased with his team’s effort but was happy to get away with the victory.  “I think part of it is that Anthony Davis did not play, so they played extremely spirited,” Rivers said in his postgame press conference.  “I thought it was a tough game coming into it – back-to-back home games.  We had so many chances to put it away and we just could not.  You’re not going to win them all, but it was a good one to win because it was back-to-back games.  In my opinion, we didn’t play great, yet we still won the game.\u003cbr/\u003e“We had 114 points and shot 47 percent,” he continued. “But I didn’t think we did a good job, to be honest.”\u003cbr/\u003ePart of the Clippers’ lethargy may have stemmed from the fact that Sunday marked the second of back-to-back 12:30 PM tipoffs, an unfortunate reality of the NBA calendar, and the Staples Center scheduling totem pole.  But Jordan wouldn’t use it as any justification.\u003cbr/\u003e“This schedule is no excuse,” he said.  “Everybody else has 82 games piled up together also, so that is no excuse for us.\u003cbr/\u003e“We played poorly tonight, especially down the stretch,” Jordan continued.  “Some games you have got to grind it out and that is what we did today.\u003cbr/\u003e“Their guards had it going early.  We just tried to make it tough for them and not give up too many threes.  We wanted to limit those guys to one shot.  Like I said, some games you have got to grind it out and get stops when they count.”\u003cbr/\u003ePaul concurred saying, “They were getting in the paint, they were making shots, especially early.  But luckily we held on and we’ll take it.  All of them aren’t gonna be pretty.”\u003cbr/\u003eAll in all, Lob City should feel lucky to have emerged victorious in this one.  While not to forget that the Clippers remain shorthanded themselves in the absence of Blake Griffin, who is still on the shelf with a partially torn left quad tendon, they looked totally out of sync at times on Sunday.  Once the Pelicans turned to heavier trapping of the Clipper ballhandlers up high in the second half, they largely failed to exploit the 4-on-3 situations generated by those traps.  Furthermore, they often looked uncomfortable executing their defensive schemes (which have featured increased switching on pick-and-rolls) against the Pelicans attack and were left with bad mismatches like Paul on Anderson for far too frequently.  \u003cbr/\u003eThough Mbah a Moute, another former Bruin, looked great with a season-high 14 points on some nice hard cuts to the hoop, there are still a lot of questions for this team’s identity without Griffin.  Redick, who has carried the team on many nights with his hot shooting, was just 2-for-10 on Sunday.  Meanwhile, both Lance Stephenson and Josh Smith remain bolted to the floorboard in the Coach Rivers’ doghouse.  Getting outrebounded 56-47 by a team missing their leading rebounder in Davis stings too, and the 14 turnovers and 52.9% mark from the line as a team certainly didn’t help matters either.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3024\" data-orig-width=\"4032\"\u003e\u003cimg

data-orig-width=\"4032\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eNevertheless, finding creative ways to get in the win column, even when you’re not at the top of your game, is key in the slog of an 82-game season.  Some nights, you’ll have to fight injuries, shooting slumps, or just general teamwide ineffectiveness, and that’s just a fundamental fact of the unpredictable NBA life.  What matters at the end of the day is victories, and that’s what the Clippers have been getting as of late, improving to an impressive 8-0 since Griffin went down and holding firm as the fourth seed in the Western Conference.  \u003cbr/\u003eThe Clippers will next face the Miami Heat on Wednesday night, a 7:30 PM PST tipoff at Staples Center.  The Pelicans meanwhile, who fall to 11-25 with the loss, will stay in town and face the Lakers on Tuesday night, also a 7:30 PM PST tipoff at Staples.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

But in Phoenix [a 120-101 loss to the Suns on November 17th in which Williams put up 16 points], I was able to play within my bounds and make shots and find a good rhythm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Just gotta continue to be aggressive,” he continued.  “Sometimes, if you\u0026rsquo;re around this league long enough, during the season, sometimes you\u0026rsquo;re gonna have stretches where shots aren\u0026rsquo;t gonna fall and you gotta find other ways to make a positive impact on the court. And getting fouled and being able to get to the line has been one of those outlets for me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I\u0026rsquo;ve shot way worse than I have now. It just comes with the territory when you\u0026rsquo;re a scorer, you have good runs and you have bad runs.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso part of Williams’ learning curve as a new Laker is that he’s being tasked with heavier ball-handling/playmaking duties this season than he’s been used to.  After logging 89 percent of his minutes at the shooting guard position for the Raptors last year, Williams is seeing 59 percent of his minutes for the Lakers at point guard (per Basketball Reference) and is often being relied upon as a primary creator for the second unit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It\u0026rsquo;s been years,” said Williams about his increased handling responsibilities.  “The most ballhandling I do is when I get a rebound or an outlet and just running drag pick-and-rolls but as far as initiating the offense, bringing the ball down, it\u0026rsquo;s probably been at least five or six years since I\u0026rsquo;ve done that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I\u0026rsquo;d definitely say it’s been an adjustment with the way our offense is set up,” he went on. “You have scoring opportunities from all five spots on the court with the open style of play that we have so my job is to initiate the offense and at the end of the day, just make plays.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother piece of new territory for the 29-year-old Williams with the Lakers this season: he’s being relied on as a mentor for some of the Lakers’ young guards such as D’Angelo Russell, Jordan Clarkson, and Anthony Brown. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It\u0026rsquo;s been different,” Williams said.  “It reminds me of my experience when I was in Philadelphia when we had four or five young guys come in at the same time and try to put everything on the fly. It took us about three or four years to kind of start seeing the fruits of our labor.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut this year’s Lakers have presented a unique challenge for Williams.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We’re rushing the process here with these guys because we\u0026rsquo;re like, ‘We need to do it right now. We need to go right now.’ And so it\u0026rsquo;s been a very different role for me, just trying to get those guys to have the knowledge that I have about the game and just trying to help as much as I can.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWilliams opened up on some of the tidbits of wisdom he’s trying to impart on the team’s youngbloods as well saying, “Just how to come in and compete every day and just understand that this is not a hobby. It\u0026rsquo;s not something that you do on the weekends. It\u0026rsquo;s your job and you have to come in and have a professional attitude and that requires to carry yourself in a certain manner and to come in and compete every day in practice and the game.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe former Naismith Prep Player of the Year went on to praise the young talent that the Lakers have, while also admitting that they still have a lot of work to do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I\u0026rsquo;ve been very impressed with these young guys and how they approach every day,” Williams said. “I think the biggest challenge for us is gonna be to make some of these great practices that we have with them translate into having great games. You come into practice, we have a ton of energy with these guys, they talk they communicate, they\u0026rsquo;re getting after it, and then in the games, we kinda take a step back because we\u0026rsquo;re playing against somebody different than the guys that you\u0026rsquo;re comfortable with. So I think that we have to translate that onto the game floor.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWilliams singled out Russell in particular, who has been under the public microscope for his lackluster rookie season thus far as well as his slow development.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“[D’Angelo’s] just gotta understand that it\u0026rsquo;s nine guys on the floor that has the same talent level, if not better, that he has,” said Williams. “In college, you\u0026rsquo;ll probably have two or three guys on the floor that can really play and you have six or seven guys that are just decent. And up here, it\u0026rsquo;s gonna be ten guys on the floor that can play, that\u0026rsquo;s gonna be able to sniff out the no-look passes, that\u0026rsquo;s gonna be able to sniff out some of the fancy things that you want to do, and you just gotta get adjusted to that.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLakers head coach Byron Scott understands that the unfamiliar role he is tasking his new veteran guard with is a difficult one, and appreciates what Williams has brought to the team in the early going.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“He’s the same Lou that I thought we would get,” said Scott also after Thursday’s practice. “Somebody who\u0026rsquo;s aggressive on the offensive end, who\u0026rsquo;s done a lot better as a leader than I thought. Been very adamant in the locker room with the younger players and does a pretty good job defensively. And I didn\u0026rsquo;t think that was the Lou that we were getting.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eScott acknowledged Williams’ struggles from the field early on though, but recognizes that it comes with the territory of coming to a new team .  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“He hasn\u0026rsquo;t shot the ball well and that\u0026rsquo;s something that he\u0026rsquo;s been real upset about with himself. He\u0026rsquo;s coming out for the last four, five days getting extra shots, trying to find that rhythm. But I don\u0026rsquo;t worry about Lou that much. I think any time you go to a new system, it takes time for that to kick in and I think that\u0026rsquo;s where he is right now.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eScott also praised Williams’ competitive fire as a vocal leader for the young guards as well as his ability to draw fouls.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“He\u0026rsquo;s pretty fiery. That\u0026rsquo;s the one thing I don\u0026rsquo;t think we all thought about him when he got here. He has a lot of fire. A very competitive guy too. He spoke to the guys when we were in Miami [a 101-88 loss to the Heat on November 10th] and he wasn\u0026rsquo;t happy about the way we were playing at that time and I think guys responded to it. But that\u0026rsquo;s the one thing I didn\u0026rsquo;t think we were getting is a leader. And that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what I see in him. One of those guys that walks the walk well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“He doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily have to shoot 45, 50 percent for him to be effective because he does get to the free throw line,” Scott continued.  “He gets there six, seven times a game. And at times, when he\u0026rsquo;s playing 24, 25 minutes, he can get there in double-digits. He\u0026rsquo;s one of those guys that knows how to create opportunities for himself and if he\u0026rsquo;s not shooting well, he can still get numbers up for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“That\u0026rsquo;s an art, the way he draws it as an art form, he draws more fouls from the three-point line than I\u0026rsquo;ve seen from anybody.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s on Scott however to balance his rotation between the veterans like Williams and the youngsters like Russell and how to deploy them when they do see the court, which are aspects that he is still trying to figure out early in the season.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I think the fact that [Lou’s] out there on the court is what he wants to be. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if he\u0026rsquo;s handling the ball or if he\u0026rsquo;s off the ball. But like I said, I\u0026rsquo;ve made some changes with putting him at that point guard position, especially with the emergence of Metta [World Peace], having him at the 3, and then Nick [Young] at the 2, instead of having Marcelo [Huertas], then him, then Nick. That\u0026rsquo;s probably why I made the change.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“As a player, you want to play when the game\u0026rsquo;s on the line. If you got any competitive nature in you at all, you want to play when the game\u0026rsquo;s on the line,” Scott continued when pressed about his fourth-quarter playing time decisions.  “I know Lou has that and I think D'Angelo has that as well. It\u0026rsquo;s just a matter of a young guy still learning and understanding what he has to do when he\u0026rsquo;s out there on a day-to-day basis. So he\u0026rsquo;s got a couple opportunities, a little further in the season, he\u0026rsquo;s gonna get a lot more. For me, in the fourth quarter in the last six, seven minutes, it\u0026rsquo;s whoever is playing the best, that\u0026rsquo;s who I\u0026rsquo;m gonna go with.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor Williams, who largely HAS been getting that nod from Scott in the fourth quarter, his new role with the Lakers is an unfamiliar one, but a welcome one.  He’ll only get better and grow more comfortable as the season goes on and he logs more reps with his new teammates, and hopefully Williams has finally found the home he’s been looking for throughout his NBA career in Los Angeles.  \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWords By:\u003c/i\u003e Darryn Albert\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhoto By:\u003c/i\u003e Darryn Albert\u003c/p\u003e",

In his first full length release as Kommode, Bøe created \u003ci\u003eAnalog Dance Music\u003c/i\u003e with two goals in mind: to make art the individual can sing and dance to even amidst the turmoil and strife of the world today, and to break from the distractions of a digital society by recording with a band playing physical instruments (hence, “analog”). While these goals are largely accomplished, \u003ci\u003eAnalog Dance Music\u003c/i\u003e mainly plays it safe with a homogenous style and seems to straddle the border between ‘introspective work of art’ and ‘happy dance album.’\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eAnalog Dance Music\u003c/i\u003e starts out strong on first listen - in fact, the listener is immediately confronted with three bouncing tunes complete with thick bass lines, tasteful embellishment, and a driving uptempo feel. Bøe’s soft vocals evoke the feeling of an intimate performance, as if you’re sitting in the living room with the musicians themselves. The issue of repetitiveness (as so commonly found in dance music) is eliminated from the instrumental breaks of each song; a phrase begins to grow stale just before a lush trumpet or a soft arpeggiator is brought into the fold and adds new intrigue to the sound. Even technically this album shines brightly, for it is engineered to near Steely Dan-type quality. This is music that demands to be listened to in headphones, or on quality speakers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile the songs after “Lady-Logic” do not differ significantly in quality, they do not seem to differ in practically anything at all. That thumping bass, compressed percussion, sleepy vocals, and uptempo, common time beat lets one song flow to the next with a little too much ease, each new song nearly indistinguishable from the last. It is here after the first three songs that the originality of Kommode’s sound starts to break down, encroaching on one trick pony territory. Bøe’s lyrics only add to the problem, for though each song contains his signature vagueness and obscurity, a third of them are about dancing. More than halfway through the album, the initial groove and intrigue from one’s first listen is gone, and by the last song the listening experience is indiscernible from that of an hour long “House Music Mix For Studying - Vol 1” on YouTube.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKommode effortlessly accomplishes their goal to get the listener moving, as the mix of pop, funk, and house paired with a finely polished mix makes for an easily danceable set of tunes. However, the lack of originality and deviation from form makes these songs fall into an unfortunate sameness that plagues the second half of the album, after an enjoyable first.\u003c/p\u003e",

The duo Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein, members of the Australian synthwave band S U R V I V E, rose to astronomical acclaim for their dark and unnerving sonic landscapes. Anyone who has watched the show will agree that the soundtrack played a significant role in the aesthetic of the entire production. As someone who is completely obsessed with\u003ci\u003e Stranger Things\u003c/i\u003e, the chance to hear the music live was enough to persuade me to drop $130 on one ticket to a completely sold out show (yeah, you read that right.) I was expecting a cosmic journey through the esoteric landscape of human existence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026hellip;but, myself and 1,600 \u003ci\u003eStranger Things\u003c/i\u003e fans were bitterly disappointed. I wanted so badly to write a rave review of how amazing this show was\u0026hellip; but I just can’t. So without further ado, let’s get down to (some ugly) business.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’ll start with the fact that the set, which was listed as a two hour show, lasted exactly 46 minutes. Yup. 46 measly minutes. Compared to the show, the actual lengths of the soundtracks are one hour and eight minutes for Season 1, and one hour and 13 minutes for Season 2. I don’t need to do the math for you. This in itself was outrageous, purely in consideration of the amount the tickets cost (the cheapest seat was 42 dollars BEFORE scalpers and StubHub). For the price, they could have stayed onstage for AT LEAST a full hour before disappearing mysteriously into the curtains.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1165\" data-orig-width=\"2254\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/552576400a248bf87761e62f9a680b3f/tumblr_inline_p1mzw4HRNS1qhakxc_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1165\" data-orig-width=\"2254\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of curtains, let’s move to stage setup. The music itself is undeniably cool, so it would be reasonable to expect equally cool staging and lighting to add to the experience. This seemed to be too much to expect, as there was only two light riggings onstage and a synth setup, and that was it. The stage was completely bare. No lasers, no special effects, no projections, just some weak fog machines pitifully spitting out a pathetic amount of smoke. Watching two shadowy figures press buttons on synth boards while only two light patterns alternated back and forth was arguably as exciting as a CS31 lecture (and I’m talking Stahl, not Smallberg). Seriously, I was so bored without visual stimulus that I just started scrolling through Twitter, which was much more entertaining than anything happening onstage. This was all disappointing in itself, but not as disappointing as the missed opportunity to create an intensely spectacular lighting accompaniment that would have escalated the entire show. The whole thing was so visually static and boring that people got up and left. Seriously.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, I know what you’re thinking. You go to a show for the music and everything else is just extra. Oh, dear reader that probably doesn’t exist, I WISH the musical aspect was enough to save the show, but even that was a disappointment. I’ll start by saying that THEY NEVER EVEN PLAYED THE THEME SONG. At the end of the day, synth is synth, and to make it exciting is a hard task that seemed to be insurmountable for even Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein. They tweaked a few sounds here and there, added some eerie chorus vocals, but they played only two recognizable songs (“Agents” and “Eleven”). Soundtrack music often tends to sound the same, and there was no way to differentiate what I was hearing during the entire show except for the two instances that notable songs were played. Listening to straight synth for that long when it is hard to decipher what specifically you’re hearing is not the most enjoyable experience, and it ended up feeling like a chore.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLive orchestrations of soundtracks have been successfully done and are successfully done all the time. When done well, they are incredibly worth it. Take a page out of the \u003ci\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/i\u003e book. At the concert that was held over summer at the Forum, the composer interacted with the audience by sharing insight into the compositions, and the performers themselves had choreographed stage presence while scenes from the show were projected onto screens above the stage. Or even Alt-J, who are pretty undynamic as performers on a stage, make a point to create a visually captivating setup. One could argue that the point was aesthetic. But to be honest, aesthetic means nothing when your show falls flat. So argue all you want if you’re willing to pay $130 for a ticket to be bored for the ~aesthetic~\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1195\" data-orig-width=\"1663\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/08be86223379071e86f88a2b20653328/tumblr_inline_p1mzv9BtkY1qhakxc_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"1195\" data-orig-width=\"1663\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll in all, I truly wish I hadn’t spent the time, energy, or money to attend such a lackluster show. But I did, so all I can do now is write a bad review about it. And if anyone is even reading it at this point, feel free to let Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein know that they need to step up their game.\u003c/p\u003e",

When the future of your favorite show is non-existent, it may be difficult to navigate your own fate. In these dark times, I advise fellow viewers to remember this old adage: it’s better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all. Take whatever time you need to mourn your fallen series, but once you’re ready to move on, you’ll see that the internet is host to many other promising options. There are other fish in the sea — or should I say, “shows in the stream” — just waiting for you to find them, if you’d only open your eyes. I’ve lost a few favorites too soon myself and would like to share some recommendations for series \n\nwith releases within the past year\n\nto fill the void.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eIf You Loved: \u003ci\u003eFreaks and Geeks\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eFreaks and Geeks\u003c/i\u003e was Judd Apatow’s magnum opus, documenting the brutally realistic yet entertaining 80s high school experience from many perspectives. The show was cut short after just one season due to a combination of several tragic errors that led to low viewing rates. From a poor show time at 8 pm on a Saturday evening, when its intended audience was likely not home, to a three-week gap between the airing of two episodes, the show could not catch a break. \u003ci\u003eFreaks and Geeks\u003c/i\u003e was canceled after only 12 of the 18 episodes had aired because it had such a rough time building a following. The show is now a classic, known for launching the careers of Seth Rogen, Martin Starr, Jason Segel, and, our very own UCLA film professor, James Franco.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eRecommendation: \u003ci\u003eAmerican Vandal\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany are still heartbroken about this loss, and while no show can truly replace it, \u003ci\u003eAmerican Vandal\u003c/i\u003e comes damn close for younger generations. This Netflix mockumentary series cracks the case of who spray-painted large, red, phallic images on the cars in a high school parking lot. The show hones in on lead suspect Dylan Maxwell, the ringleader of the “Wayback Boys.” His squad is a group of “freaks” who are just as rowdy, crude, and unliked by their peers as Daniel and Lindsay’s gang from \u003ci\u003eFreaks and Geeks\u003c/i\u003e. \u003ci\u003eAmerican Vandal\u003c/i\u003e does an excellent job of portraying what high school for recent graduates was like, complete with competitive water bottle flipping, tasteless 9/11 jokes, and trashy Instagram boomerangs. Check it out if you enjoyed \u003ci\u003eFreaks and Geeks\u003c/i\u003e, but were too young to find it relatable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eIf You Loved: \u003ci\u003eFlight of the Conchords\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eNew Zealand musical comedy duo Jemaine Clement and Bret McKenzie starred in and wrote for their own show, \u003ci\u003eFlight of the Conchords\u003c/i\u003e. In the series, the two were in a band and had just moved from New Zealand to New York in search of fame and love. The partially improvised show, smattered with digs at romantically unaware men and clever songs, ran for two seasons, from 2007 to 2009. The pair halted the project for fear of dragging on too long — a move that was both a blessing and a curse to fans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eRecommendation: \u003ci\u003ePortlandia\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce you’re over this loss, check out \u003ci\u003ePortlandia\u003c/i\u003e. This IFC sketch comedy with graduated SNL star Fred Armisen is lauded for its tasteful mockery of hipsters and ultra-liberals that one might find in Portland, and has SEVEN WHOLE SEASONS available for viewing on Netflix. Never have your heart broken again with this solid watch to satisfy cravings for \u003ci\u003eFlight of the Conchords\u003c/i\u003e’ jestful sense of humor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eIf You Loved: \u003ci\u003eZach Stone is Gonna Be Famous\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBo Burnham’s first and only television series to date was ironically and unfortunately aired on MTV. The show, \u003ci\u003eZach Stone is Gonna Be Famous\u003c/i\u003e, followed recent high school graduate Zach Stone, who only wants one thing: to be famous. To achieve this, he hires a camera crew to document his life for the world to see, but has trouble maintaining a facade for the camera. In reality, Zach is horribly socially inept and has no understanding of what people would find interesting and cool enough to watch. While it may seem like an idea so crazy that it just might work to air such a program alongside exactly the type of show it pokes fun at, it ended up really just being a crazy idea. Bo’s show was cut off after just one season because it failed to find its appropriate audience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eRecommendation: \u003ci\u003eNathan For You\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, Bo Burnham has a few stand-up comedy specials to choose from if you’re missing his sense of humor, but if you’re craving the extra cringe-y-ness that Zach Stone provides, fear not! \u003ci\u003eNathan For You\u003c/i\u003e, a Comedy Central series, is an excellent alternative. The cold and alien host of this show, Nathan Fielder, finds real small businesses that are struggling and provides them with avant-garde business strategies to try as serious solutions. Some of these appalling fixes include fabricating a permanent, fake movie set around a Hollywood souvenir shop to attract star-struck customers and marketing furniture moving as an exercise craze to create a free labor force for a moving business. (Sidenote: said exercise craze had a spokesperson chosen for it, an entire book ghostwritten about it, and appeared on several real news channels.) If you liked \u003ci\u003eZach Stone is Gonna Be Famous\u003c/i\u003e because you like to cringe, this show is for you.\u003c/p\u003e",

I say “cry to” in the loosest sense possible, as the Sadboy themes that were prominent all over Lean’s first and second full length LPs were never truly emotionally impactful to begin with; they translated over as bouts of slow, audibly high, drowsily delivered rap flows. However, with \u003ci\u003eStranger\u003c/i\u003e, Leandoer has a chance to strip away most of the reverb that made his tracks indulgent and syrupy. In fact, the production on \u003ci\u003eWarlord\u003c/i\u003e is what made that record one of my favorites of 2016. Now, less than two years later, Yung Lean forgives his producers from having to construct large, grandiose, enigmatic, and punishing cloud rap beats in exchange for layouts that are more melodic, full of bells, sobering, and minimalistic. “Red Bottom Sky” is an effort made by Lean to be significantly more melodic and structured than he usually is, as the Swede makes a valiant effort to sing profoundly and calmly throughout most of the track. This is a color that Lean has not really painted himself with, at least not in the endearing and determined manner he does in this song. The chorus is soft, simple, and prominent. On various fronts, Lean contains this type of energy throughout the album, as his vocals are never truly cloudy or as atmospheric as they were back in 2016.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Ski Mask” is a brash, melodic unraveling of drug use and “laying low” as the hook repeats. Lyrically, Lean stays within the similar boundaries that he usually does as he presents his “reality” through a very fantastical, drug fueled, and hypnotic lens. The repetition of various words throughout the song prevent Lean from stumbling awkwardly across the track as he otherwise could be if he were to switch up his cadence every couple bars or so.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Silver Arrows” is similar to “Red Bottom Sky” in how the flows are consistent and the beat is composed mainly of bubbling bass hits and slow, echoed bells and synths. There is not much going on in this song except for a couple small blossoms and crashes that appear before the chorus hits. “Metallic Intuition” is a track that proves to be a sort of weak point throughout the record. It is low-key, intimate, and simply straightforward, but the beat shows a lack of rhythm that has been prominent on the album so far. The bars are washed away in reverb and Lean can be hard to understand at certain points in the mix. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany of the songs on this record are significantly easier to digest than other previous Yung Lean tracks on \u003ci\u003eWarlord\u003c/i\u003e and even \u003ci\u003eUnknown Memory\u003c/i\u003e. However, the payoff is significantly less; The intricacies found on instrumentals on \u003ci\u003eWarlord \u003c/i\u003eand \u003ci\u003eUnknown Memory\u003c/i\u003e made the songs unique in their own way and presented Lean in a nest of noise, massive energies, and tsunami sized winter vibes. Here, the winter tones are still prominent, yet the sweetness displayed through most of the bells and the light, bouncy synth bass that is found on almost every track here provides a stark contrast to what Lean was doing before. The happiness can be short lived, however, since the often minimal and skeletal beats that Lean plays around with do not provide much substance. Lean is therefore forced to use his voice as either a prominent instrument on the tracks or as a lyrical palette that describes his fantasies, his achievements, and his emotions. I must admit, that Lean does not provide either one of the aforementioned tasks in a fleshed out, well developed method. As a result, his songs often feel very mindless and off the cuff. A great example of this would be the track, “Salute/Pacman,” where Lean attempts to sing in a brash way in order to use his voice as an extra instrument on the sluggish, unadventurous beat. The lyrics are an endearing thank you to his fans, but they do not go deeper into his relationship with his fans or his perception of the people that put him where he is now other than that. “Drop It/Scooter” is a more appealing attempt at achieving what he aimed to do on “Salute/Pacman.” However, the metaphors to Johnny Depp and Freddie Kruger, and a short lived attempt to ride the same triplet flow popularized by Migos and Lil Uzi Vert, take away from the bravely yelled and howling chorus presented on the track. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Hunting My Own Skin” is a better presentation of the energy given to listeners on “Red Bottom Sky,” laced over with icy, solid synth bells and atmospheric pads on top of a thumping kick pattern. It is a reminder that Lean had all the talent on his team to achieve the vision he presented early in the record; but it seems that he got carried away, or maybe even lazy, throughout the entire middle portion of the record. The album is a mixed bag, but it all ends up falling short of the marks that he set for himself on earlier records. I wouldn’t be surprised if many fans end up deserting the entire collective completely. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e6/10\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Although the Bruins only returned one starter from last year’s team, it did return its top two men off the bench from a year ago. With the expected starting lineup consisting of those three men paired with two freshmen, in addition to getting a huge boost from some players returning from injury, the expectations for this team are through the roof. The new starting guard this year is a familiar face to the fans. Aaron Holiday returns to the starting lineup after playing the role of sixth man a year ago. He started almost every game as freshman before he took a backseat to Lonzo Ball. Holiday is a tenacious defender, and complements that with his aggressive moves to the basket. Where he differs most from Ball is that he is a much better pure shooter, as he shot over 40 percent from three a year ago. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe next man to know is Tom Welsh. Welsh is a senior, who has seen consistent playing time ever since he got to Westwood. What some don’t know is that Welsh has changed his game this year. The nation’s best free throw shooter may also just be the nation’s best three point shooter. Welsh has adapted his game so now he can stretch the floor and start draining the three ball. He complements this ability with his rock-solid hook shot from the post, his solid rebounding, and great post defense. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe third starter will be senior G.G. Goloman. Goloman played around 15 minutes a night last year, but will be asked to do a lot more this year. He will assume the starting power forward position and will be asked to do a lot more on the offense and defensive side of the ball. Goloman is expected to run more pick and roll sets with Holiday and the other guards. In addition, he will be asked to guard more post up big men, with Ike Anigbogu having gone to the NBA draft. Everything said about Goloman from training camp has been extremely positive and the team expects him to have a breakout season. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first man off the bench this year will be Prince Ali. Ali is a redshirt sophomore who is ready to fulfill the expectations many had when he came to campus three years ago. Ali will be asked to handle the ball a lot off the bench when leading the second unit, since the team lacks a true backup ball handler. In addition, Ali is healthy again, which means his athleticism and length will be a huge advantage for this team. He will allow the team to run a small ball lineup with four guards on the floor. Expect Ali to have a similar year to what Holiday had last year in which he will be talked about as the best sixth man in the country, as he is able to put up around 12 points a game. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe final returning member of the team in the rotation is Alec Olesinki. The redshirt sophomore is coming back from injury but is expected to have a pivotal role for the team. With a very thin depth in the front court, Coach Alford will be calling on Olesinski to play around 15-20 minutes a game. This will be a huge test for him as it will mean his defense will be constantly challenged by the physical big men around the Pac-12. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFreshmen to Know\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eSteve Alford has recruited a top five class again for the Bruins. Today we will highlight the two men who are starting for the Bruins from that class. At this point the statuses of LiAngelo Ball, Jalen Hill, and Cody Riley are unknown after the incident in China, so we will not discuss them. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe new stud guard coming to UCLA this year is Jaylen Hands. The best player to compare Hands to with this style of play is Zach Levine. Hands will be the primary ball handler for this team. His biggest strength is his freak athletic ability. Hands can fly people and will be putting on some wild dunks. He is also a crafty finisher in the paint, which allows him to make tough shots around the basket. He is a feisty defender as well. Him and Holiday will provide the Bruins with its best defensive duo in the last four years from the backcourt. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe next freshman was “Mr. Basketball” in Indiana last year. It is an extremely prestigious award to win, and he joins a long list of great college players who have won the award. Some of the recent winners include Greg Oden, Eric Gordon, Tyler Zeller, Cody Zeller, Gary Harris, and Caleb Swanigan. The guy who will be suiting up for UCLA is Kris Wilkes. His offensive game is a little raw right now, but he has the makings of an elite scorer with his large wingspan and ability to get to the rim. What most fans are excited about is what he brings with his size and length. Wilkes can guard every man on the floor, from the point guard to the back to the basket center. This will be a tremendous advantage for the Bruins when they go to smaller lineups, as he can switch onto any player in the pick and roll scenario. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs you can see, there is a lot to be excited about in Westwood with this basketball team as the season rolls around. The expectations are sky high for this bunch, not just this year but for the years to come. \u003c/p\u003e",

Above all, the record sounds clean and deeply intentional, and this show only further emphasized that impression through Alvvays’ precise, largely emotionless performance.\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe very adult audience for this show ranged from fans in their twenties to their sixties, mostly balancing around 30 to 40 year olds. The only two teenage girls I saw were standing with their mom. Many men and women donned plaid button-down shirts and glasses. “It’s indie music, what are you afraid of?” one thirty-something-year-old woman asked her friend, who was hesitating from cutting into the peaceful crowd. Someone else in the crowd asked, “How do you say their name?” The answer is “like always,” by the way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlvvays’ opener, an all-male indie four-piece called Nap Eyes, was a pleasant prelude. Their songs were enjoyable, not particularly unique but high quality. They kept thanking the audience for listening or paying any attention to them, and re-emphasizing that they’re called Nap Eyes, the long-haired bassist joking, “In case it slipped your mind.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1024\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/127e6798198781dcd70b8b288a1702f8/tumblr_inline_ozc7hmbyQn1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1024\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the dot at 9:30 p.m., Alvvays sauntered on stage amid a monochrome backdrop which projected their name crookedly in massive block letters. The fan-favorite is definitely their lead singer and guitarist, Molly Rankin, a composed young woman with white-blonde hair that captured the colors of the stage lights. Despite being at the forefront for the band, she remained largely silent between songs. The other four members of the band barely engaged with the audience at all: a male guitarist in a black polo, a curly-haired female drummer, a bored male bassist, and a brunette female keyboardist with thick glasses. The five performers spread themselves far apart on the stage, just occasionally glancing at each other. Frankly, Alvvays looked like they were going through the motions to finish their jobs for the night, but their obvious over-rehearsal paid off in their sound.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe band shuffled the songs on their new album, for example, bouncing from “Plimsoll Punks” to “Lollipop (Ode to Jim)” to “Not My Baby.” They also added in some old hits including “Archie, Marry Me,” which brought out the most audience enthusiasm among bright yellow lights. Hats off to Rankin; her voice sounds just as clear and angelic live as recorded, if anything too covered by heavy instrumentals and dreamy reverb at times in concert. The overall sound was very similar to the record - the audio was no disappointment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1024\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fc587c817bf172e0c754d16d80e03019/tumblr_inline_ozc7irqfnw1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1024\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, their performance seemed distant. It felt as if Alvvays was re-recording the album, going through the songs with wonderful precision, rarely commenting. Rankins’s occasional transitions were at most brief sentences, like “Mind if we play an escapist ballad for you?” before “Forget About Life,” or introducing “Dreams Tonite” with simply, “Time to get romantic.” Even their few moments of grandeur, a bold drum solo in “In Undertow” or an extra high note, appeared calculated. No one broke the stiff facade. The bassist looked so underwhelmed at times that he stared out, mouth agape.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI don’t mean to imply that the band was rude; they simply seemed reserved, or disconnected from the room. The performers rarely smiled, but when Rankin did chat she put on a quick grin. Also, her hands are full, literally; her guitar I’m sure takes much of her attention. Their rigidity also didn’t stop the fans from being fairly enthused. Only about 45 to 50 minutes in, Alvvays announced that they just had one song left, which the audience actually booed. The moment the final pre-encore song, “Party Police,” finished, Alvvays hustled offstage without even looking at the audience, but one fan still playfully yelled the chorus lyric back to them: “You don’t have to leave!” Aside from that booing, the crowd was nodding throughout the show, even jumping, and consistently resembled a whack-a-mole of recording devices, iPhones peeking up to take a picture or two before retreating.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNPR’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/08/31/547013497/first-listen-alvvays-antisocialites\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFirst Listen\u003c/a\u003e reported that Rankin described \u003ci\u003eAntisocialites\u003c/i\u003e as a “fantasy breakup arc,” but live it felt more like when you’ve talked about a breakup so many times that you no longer draw any emotion when explaining it. And that’s fine; being loose or messy is not their scene. The impression left on me was just a numb performance, bored but not bad.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1024\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/12d2ea675e3777140befb1d5e6231416/tumblr_inline_ozc7jeQRHH1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"768\" data-orig-width=\"1024\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003ePeople go to concerts for different reasons. If you go to a show to hear a band live and just focus on the music, you should definitely go to an Alvvays show, the music was superb. If you just love the concert experience and want to meet fellow fans, sure, go. Or if you’re in love with Rankin as so many other fans are, go (but don’t try to kiss her like some jerk did in Belgium this September \u0026ndash; respect, people!). However, based on this performance, don’t go if you expect audience engagement, interaction with the musicians, or being entertained by bold, outgoing personalities. Personally, I’m the kind of audience member looking for something more than just the record, and I didn’t really get that. Alvvays is very talented but I’ll likely skip their next show and just listen to their recordings at home instead \u0026ndash; they sound the same.\u003c/p\u003e",

At the largest halloween festival in North America, comprising of four stages - the Slaughterhouse, Ghouls’ Graveyard, The Chopping Block, and Cannibals’ Tea Party - sending beats down concurrently, we had to shuttle ourselves back and forth between the stages to catch all the artists that we wanted to see. The event setup lived up to its name; we were truly convinced that we were part of a movie set in a circus - think Christmas bulbs, fairground lights, circus tents, carousels and performers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTHE VIP EXPERIENCE\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe enjoyed the concert at the VIP section, which was an area to the front left of each stage with seats in an outdoor patio, abundance of photo opportunities and refreshments, as well as wifi and electrical plugs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere was also a sectioned off area next to the crowd, which allowed those with VIP wristbands to get a close view of the performers but also have enough room to move around and dance. The convenience and comfortability of it all definitely merits the extra price of a VIP ticket.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"746\" data-orig-height=\"1036\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0961fd7a7b5e690e87f6947e91fcbc07/tumblr_inline_oyvhwejpC91qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"746\" data-orig-height=\"1036\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTHE MUSIC\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe line-up this year matched the unprecedented scale of the event that hosted 125,000 costumed fans - absolutely mind-blowing! Ranging from trap-heavy Flosstradamus and techno-oriented Pan-pot, to deep house legends Duke Dumont and Jamie Jones, there was a comprehensive selection of 75 headliners under the electronic dance music umbrella. Out of serendipity, we found ourselves at Bauuer’s set at the Chopping House. The New York native  knew how to throw a hardstyle party, enrapturing the tent with flaming-hot beats and cross-genre mixes (a.k.a. “headbangers”). Among many others, R3hab, Tïesto, Don Diablo, and Afrojack had all begun my electronic dance music journey with me, so I had an overly joyous moment to myself when I met some of them in real life (or as Alexis would put it, “actually fangirling”). Finally, NGHTMRE, one of my favorite emerging artists, owned the last set at the Ghouls’ Graveyard stage, which made a perfect end to the festival on Saturday night. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2048\" data-orig-height=\"1366\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/beabca6ed60e664c286d78c71cd5561d/tumblr_inline_oyvhy5vCu31qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2048\" data-orig-height=\"1366\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhoto Courtesy of Da Black Swan for Insomniac\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTHE VISUALS\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2048\" data-orig-height=\"1363\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/629e14c16ea75c27c81cc2001b4bf355/tumblr_inline_oyvi00IRBE1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2048\" data-orig-height=\"1363\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhoto Courtesy of Jake West for Insomniac \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough the photo has captured the light arrangements to the best of its abilities, it still does not compare to the effect it achieved in real life. Housing 375 lights and 24 lasers, the performances were taken to another level of excitement and intensity. We highly recommend getting a pair of kaleidoscope glasses too for the full sensory experience (we found ours on Amazon); it is definitely worth the investment.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eADD-ONS\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore we saw any artists, we were fortunate enough to experience the horrifically immersive environment of the Asylum, where we were first dressed in straitjackets and a mask before we entered the world of gore and blood. There was something new with every corner we turned - bleeding nurses chopping up their patients, creepy creatures shouting in your ear, and circus performers twisting and contorting in ways that were not humanly possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2048\" data-orig-height=\"1366\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1a2ea4356eb8394e3baee97744354159/tumblr_inline_oyvi17TVsb1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2048\" data-orig-height=\"1366\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePhoto Courtesy of aLive Coverage for Insomniac \u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe production quality was amazing, I had to constantly remind myself that it was all manufactured to keep myself from getting too scared. The makeup, costumes, and set design made it feel like we were in a horror film, keeping ourselves on our toes so we would be prepared for the next scene we were about to experience. Adding onto the surprise factor, our straitjackets fell off mid-way because they “weren’t made for small frames” like ours. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe were also able to experience the Shanghai Surprise speakeasy, a word-of-mouth bar that was only accessible through a refrigerator door in a Chinese restaurant’s lobby.

Having that said, one thing we we wish we could have also experienced was the underground scene in Factory 93. Nonetheless, the contagious exuberance of the crowd as well as the new music that we have discovered and fell in love with (welcome to the trap scene @ Alexis) will remain in our hearts forever.

These days, and especially within the realm of what some might refer to as math or progressive rock, the most exciting three-piece bands are those in which all the instruments are perfectly balanced whilst still maintaining their individual complexities (see also my writings on \u003ca href=\"http://uclaradio.tumblr.com/post/150968888330/top-5-most-anticipated-acts-at-arctangent\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTown Portal \u003c/a\u003eand Alpha Male Tea Party). Niche music festivals can often run the risk of redundancies within the lineups, but during both of my years at ArcTanGent Festival Vasudeva has always been a standout. Two-guitar bands are certainly not a new revelation but Vasudeva holds a high distinction in that each part truly carries its own voice. There is no lead or rhythm guitar between the two, just lyrical lines that flow seamlessly into one another without ever losing their distinct personalities. The musical chemistry which all three members of Vasudeva share stems largely from the fact that they are friends first and bandmates second. I sat down with guitarist Grant Mayer and drummer Derek Broomhead in their mansion-tent at ArcTanGent Festival in Bristol over the summer to discuss the band’s early development, their love of Blink-182 and the release of their new album.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eLayla:\u003c/b\u003e When did you guys first start playing together and at what point did it become what it is now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDerek:\u003c/b\u003e I was playing in a band with Corey [Mastrangelo, Vasudeva guitarist]. We were playing post-hardcore when we were fifteen years old. And we knew of Grant and we asked him to join the band. He played one rehearsal and was like “Nah,” he just dipped. Then three years later we all realized we were playing music alone. So we [decided] “Let’s do this together.” And it turned into something that we were proud of.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eL:\u003c/b\u003e It’s just a band of three people playing alone in a room together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eD:\u003c/b\u003e Yeah. Before we had our bass player it was just me, Grant and Corey figuring things out. Grant was just learning how to tap. But because of his piano background [he] was able to figure it out really quickly and in a unique way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eL: \u003c/b\u003eWhat were some of the bands you were listening to early on?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eD: \u003c/b\u003eObviously, Minus the Bear.

Just music that makes you feel good, nothing too techy or thrashy. Although we were listening to Veil of Maya a lot and that is like the heaviest band ever.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eL:\u003c/b\u003e You were like, “Okay, that’s the threshold we are not crossing.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eD: \u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003elaughter \u003c/i\u003eYeah, it’s just something we’d always throw on and have a laugh to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eG:\u003c/b\u003e That’s the fucking breakdown kings right there.

How did that come about?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eD:\u003c/b\u003e My good buddy Chris Ratay, we’d always played together but never started a band. There was this one day, the three of us were jamming and I invited [Chris] over and he was like, “I think this is sick.” He was actually a guitar player but he picked up the bass to fill the slot. We were with him for two and a half years and when he was leaving the band, we still had a lot of opportunities and were like, “What are we gonna do? We can’t replace -” Because when you’re in a band, it’s really hard to find someone that fits the mold because you have to live with those people essentially.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eL: \u003c/b\u003eYeah, especially because your band isn’t a standard operation either. You can’t just hold an audition and have some dude show up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eG: \u003c/b\u003eYeah, I’ve known Corey since I was seven. We’re not even friends, we’re fucking brothers. It’s such a deeper level of relationship that I can’t even describe.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eL: \u003c/b\u003eHow did you guys first meet at age seven?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eG:\u003c/b\u003e First day of school on the bus.

We were all skater shitheads to the core. Grant and Corey have known each other since they were children and I’ve known Corey since I was maybe 13. I was starting a band and we were pretty into the emo thing and my friend Mark was buddies with Corey. He brought him in and we instantly clicked. I think when I was 13 or 14 he stayed at my house for two months. We never separated. We were that close right off the bat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eL:\u003c/b\u003e Wow. And it’s actually sustained since then.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eD:\u003c/b\u003e Yeah, absolutely. And then I met Grant. The thing about me and Grant is we’re the exact same person but in a strange, different way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1626\" data-orig-height=\"1077\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b16c654e6fd2c33078a96ae2bcd61024/tumblr_inline_oycs9qcI2y1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1626\" data-orig-height=\"1077\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eL:\u003c/b\u003e What instruments did you guys start on that led you to what you play in the band now? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eD: \u003c/b\u003eMy dad always wanted me to play guitar. I learned a bunch of blues tunes on guitar when I was 5 or 6 and liked it a lot but I was the kid just banging out rhythm from Day 1. I asked my dad for years to get a drum kit and it got to the point where [I decided to] save up money so I had to work and basically do things for him to show I was dedicated to playing drums. I bought my first drum kit when I was 10 and it was a piece of shit. We bought it on eBay for maybe $300 but I was proud of that thing. I just remember jamming out to Blink when I was 10, trying to learn what Travis Barker was all about. That was a serious learning experience for me. Just to be on your own doing exactly what you want and figuring it out without anyone telling you what to do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eL:\u003c/b\u003e It has a very organic feel to it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eD: \u003c/b\u003eYeah, I guess. I don’t think I ever wanted to be in a band. It was just something I had to do. I never looked up to rock stars aside from Blink. I never [thought], “I want to be a sick drummer.” I just kept playing. I guess I was 14 when I decided I wanted to do this for a living. It just made the most sense and it’s been the most fun. Seriously, I could be doing bullshit but I’m out here having the best time. \u003ci\u003eTo Grant\u003c/i\u003e What about you? You started on piano, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eG:\u003c/b\u003e Yeah, it was a similar thing. My dad played guitar but he didn’t want me to play guitar. He pushed piano and saxophone onto me but I always wanted to play guitar. So I ended up teaching myself guitar while [taking] more strictly regimented lessons for the other two instruments. I gave up sax earlier, then gave up piano and focused on guitar and just taught myself how to play that with the tools I’d learned from the other mediums.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eL:\u003c/b\u003e You guys have toured extensively over the past seven years. Would you consider that to be more of your [focus] while releasing records intermittently or do you want to spend more time as a recording band as well?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eG:\u003c/b\u003e I think it’s 50/50, honestly. They are both so necessary and I see them as such fundamental parts of what we’re doing. At this point it’s cut even down the board. The more we tour the more I feel like we’re neglecting recording. And the more we’re recording [the more] I feel like we’re neglecting touring.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eD: \u003c/b\u003eYeah. Trying to find that balance is hard.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eG:\u003c/b\u003e But we’re definitely eager to get back in[to the studio] because it was a long time coming for [\u003ci\u003eNo Clearance\u003c/i\u003e, the new album].\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eL:\u003c/b\u003e Yeah, it was like three or four years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eG:\u003c/b\u003e Exactly. So we’re not trying to push that again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eD:\u003c/b\u003e The thing is, we always have music. We sit on our music for so long. We could record a lot right now.

I feel like with a lot of those songs, we reworked them to where you can’t even recognize them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eG:\u003c/b\u003e We definitely had a cohesive idea towards the whole thing. We picked and chose what we thought would be a good album together, you know? We wanted an album [where] each song would speak for itself. We didn’t want an album of a couple singles. We struggled even choosing the singles as we released them. It was arbitrary. Like, that’s what you have to do but the whole album’s a goddamn single for us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eL: \u003c/b\u003eDid you guys have a different intention going into this one over the previous one?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eD:\u003c/b\u003e I feel like we learned a lot from our first release in terms of structure and songwriting. We really wanted to write songs that made sense and never lost a vibe, but could just keep it going.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1626\" data-orig-height=\"1077\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9fb9b64007239dadc38c855b78ae37b4/tumblr_inline_oycse2Pe4G1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1626\" data-orig-height=\"1077\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eL:\u003c/b\u003e So Grant, why did you want to start tapping in the first place? What brought that on?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eG:\u003c/b\u003e Definitely just listening to the bands we mentioned before. Like, Minus and Maps. And I was like, “Yeah that’s cool. I could definitely do that for sure.” and I just [started doing] it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eD: \u003c/b\u003eEvery[day at] 5:45 in the morning you’d just be ripping a waterfall with Corey, learning how to tap.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eG: \u003c/b\u003eYeah, we were teaching ourselves together, the two of us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eL: \u003c/b\u003eHow do you and Corey put those two parts together?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eG:\u003c/b\u003e It’s a lot of back and forth. The more we’ve grown, we’ve learned to really sit and complement each other. That’s always a growing concern of ours. We’re always trying to push the limits of that, just playing your place in the song. I feel like [with] some of our earlier stuff, people almost put the math rock connotation to it because it’s two intricate guitar parts going over one another. But at the same time, it’s all 4/4. It’s all verse chorus verse, traditional song-structure. It’s just intricate. We’ve really tried to hone the songwriting process and complement each other rather than compete.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eL: \u003c/b\u003eI feel like with two-guitar bands it can be all across the spectrum as far as that balance is concerned. But you two actually have your own really distinct voices within the music, which is super cool.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eD:\u003c/b\u003e Yeah, I would agree. These are the most unique players that I’ve hung out with. It’s really cool to be in a band with someone that you actually love as a person [who] can also blow your mind every single time.

It is tense, unforgiving, and consistently fast paced, while also possessing some necessary artistic merit that makes this film worth at least one watch. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRobert Pattinson provides what could be the best performance of his career, as Constantin “Connie” Nikas, a failed bank robber trying to get ten thousand dollars to bail his brother, Nicholas, out of jail after a robbery gone wrong. Nick, played by Ben Safdie, is mentally handicapped and has supposedly faced abuse from the brothers’ grandmother. Safdie skillfully inhabits the mind of the character, projecting the pain and confusion that Nick feels, all while just wanting to be close with his older brother, Connie. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, the truly shining performances in \u003ci\u003eGood Time\u003c/i\u003e come from its supporting cast. Jennifer Jason Leigh is vicious and driven as Corey, Connie’s friend and lover who he has hold over. Leigh’s performance poignantly captures a person emotionally and financially controlled by her affection, only muddled by the very short screen time she ends up having. Newcomer Taliah Webster plays Crystal, a young girl who lives in a New York apartment that Connie finds his way into in order to get his brother away from police custody. Webster gives an incredibly natural performance that makes her character one of the most believable in the entire film. Almost as living commentary on apathetic youth, she is driven to listen to Connie out of a naive complacency that feels both neutral and rebellious, a hard middle to masterfully play, but one that Webster hits to a T. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever it is the character of Ray, played by former-inmate-turned-actor Buddy Duress, who shines and provides the film with its steel backbone. Duress plays an inmate who Connie unknowingly sneaks out of hospital custody, mistaking him for Nick, and provides the lead with a new way of getting the money to bail out his brother \u0026ndash; finding stashed robbery money and a bottle of LSD. The pinnacle of Duress’ performance comes during a monologue that goes through how he ended up in the hospital. The raw, “I was there” perspective on the thought process behind being involved in crime is one for the books. Duress gives a performance that is a natural, no-bullshit take on being on the other side of the law. The conflict between wanting to be the image of crime, and the harsh reality of being prosecuted and law-bound shakes the young man to his core. If anything, watch \u003ci\u003eGood Time \u003c/i\u003efor Duress’ skillful performance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat both makes and breaks this film is its cinematography. Much of the film features close-ups of the actors’ faces, the entire screen filled to the brim with eyes, ears, and nose. It gets the job done, as you literally cannot look away from the trauma and conflict that these characters endure when it takes up the entirety of the picture. I personally got to the point of my eyes starting to hurt from darting back and forth to see opposite ends of just one human face. Instead of this method accomplishing the effect it was meant to have, I walked away feeling as if I saw what it was trying to do, instead of feeling it work as intended. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe score, composed by Oneohtrix Point Never, is masterful. It keeps the film tense and the audience locked in, with the heavy electronic pulse that accentuates the drama and pain within the characters. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll in all, \u003ci\u003eGood Time\u003c/i\u003e is not a bad time. While its editing and sometimes rocky pacing take away from the experience, at its core it is a raw, unforgiving film about how far people will go when they are desperate. If anything, it is worth a view to experience the tragically humanizing performances given. If any picture should make the world start to pay attention to Pattinson again, this would be it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DupsR80YmwWc\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/upsR80YmwWc?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

Cook, one of the collective’s most prominent producers. The label has managed to quickly gain a strong and passionate following, thriving mostly amongst online communities. It is difficult to imagine talking about internet-based music collectives nowadays without including PC Music in the conversation. As for the overall sound of the label, it has been described as the future sound of electronic music, as well as being an active parody on the current direction of the pop genre, all through of the use of pitch-shifted female vocals and intense production. The label has received notoriety for having the possibility to shift the future direction of both the pop and electronic music scenes; some have even gone as far as championing it as a sign of the end of electronic music as we know it, while others see it as as a new movement with the potential to elevate the club scene back to its once vibrant ‘90s status. PC Music, along with Redbull Music Academy Radio, held a club night in Los Angeles showcasing off some of the label’s brightest stars. So, the only logical decision was to down a few Sambuca Redbulls and see for myself if these kids were another internet fad or actually capable of rejuvenating the pop and electronic scenes to a whole new height.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3227\" data-orig-height=\"1778\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/205c5883a1ef586b16c7f0b5c42af85b/tumblr_inline_oazl0ipLMN1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3227\" data-orig-height=\"1778\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first noticeable thing upon entering such an event was the aesthetic of it all. The room was brimming with twenty-something adults uniformly wearing all white or a mix of bright fuchsia and pastel pink with reflective neon sunglasses despite being indoors. It was like walking into the strange lovechild of an early ‘90s club scene and the human manifestation of internet culture. The attention given to aesthetic details extended far beyond the crowd itself and permeated every aspect of the night’s performances. First to the stage was easyFun, radiating the feeling of drowning in a soda fountain sea of Orange Crush, taking the stage in an orange sweater under the glow of orange lights. Much like opinions regarding PC Music as a whole, each artist from the collective’s atmosphere was divisive from one another as could be. Next was Spinee, a noticeable standout of the first part of the night, who followed with an ode to early MySpace electronic music all while incorporating internet in-jokes that gave off the sense of losing yourself in a twisted version of the Matrix. The night continued with Lil Data sticking with primarily minimalist techno visuals, GFOTY performing a raucous set flanked with spastic red visuals and a pair of male and female strippers, and Felicita roaming around the stage, with an iPad in hand, accompanied by performers adorning elaborate makeup blowing bubbles into the crowd. Before the main names of the label had even taken the stage, it had already felt like I had seen everything from the personification of internet culture to a fine performance art piece I was not all too sure I understood.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1641\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f9cad0f700dbfdba290c4144a1b45fa5/tumblr_inline_oazl2qgVz51qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"1641\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe next chapter of the night was perhaps the most bizarre as some of PC Music’s most prominent producers were joined by two of the biggest names in pop music. The climax was led by QT, who serves PC Music as their marketed pop star and living embodiment of a somewhat fictitious energy drink. QT took the stage in a robotic fashion where she grandiosely opened a can of said beverage, capitalizing on the crowd’s elation over such a simple yet now suddenly magical task, before jumping into a number of songs that were reminiscent of some of the best radio friendly pop hits released in recent memory. The rest of the night shifted towards a more straightforward, albeit at times slightly experimental, pop and electronic direction. A.G. Cook invited Hannah Diamond on stage to sing a few ballads revolving around young love and dreaming of being noticed by that special someone. The two ended their set with popstar Charli XCX joining them to perform a number of electronic anthems, which had the essence of eurodance hits from the likes of Alice Deejay and Underworld. The final chapter of the showcase began in extraordinary fashion as Danny L Harle took the stage. I noticed that standing beside me was easyFun, A.G. Cook, and Hannah Diamond, hollering at the top of their lungs as their friend began his set. The end of the night was signaled by the PC Music group standing beside me going hysterical with the rest of the crowd as pop idol Carly Rae Jepsen took the stage to perform two unreleased songs with Danny L Harle. The night was an infusion from the depths of internet culture, experimental electronic music, and at times pop in its purest form.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1295\" data-orig-height=\"586\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9aacffb401536c7e0a38d7a94ea3e9fa/tumblr_inline_oazl4jExHD1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1295\" data-orig-height=\"586\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIs PC Music more than just another passing internet subculture that is likely to see its end in the near future or can it be considered the future of pop music? The only thing that I am sure of after losing my surroundings in a stream of constant fog machines and flashing purple lights, as the room filled with the mixture of early club music and modern production tweaked to its most extremes, was that it was a lively and carefree time. The night was evocative of a club scene that is rarely available now and was mostly unavailable during its peak to most of the youth-aged crowd. It is currently unclear whether PC Music is capable of anything as grandiose as being the new direction of pop music or revitalizing the club scene, but as I watched easyFun, Hannah Diamond, and A.G. Cook effervescently cheering on their peer, while dancing maniacally in the crowd, it was clear that the PC Music collective love the direction they are currently headed and have managed to find a devoted following that feels the same way. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Raphaelle Standelle-Preston, Austin Tufts, and Taylor Smith seamlessly blend conventional rock band instrumentation (guitar/drums/voice) with brooding, bombastic electronic soundscapes to create an audio environment that is completely manipulatable by the band as a unit; despite the band’s complex audio manipulation and conceptual blurring of lines between convention and experimentation, the melodies are catchy earworms that burrow themselves into the listener’s memory and the beats are hard, danceable grooves representational of this era’s pension towards deep bass and pulsing rhythms. The group has released three captivating full lengths and, after the release the new Companion extended play, recently shared Braids with a Silverlake eager to expand upon their preconceived notions regarding what a live band is capable of doing in a single, enchanted evening.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe trio is an idealistic beacon. After catching glimpses of their involved set-up process, one can assume that Braids ascribes to the Do It Yourself aesthetic governing the practices of groups who want complete artistic control over their sound and iconography. They set up their own gear; they travel with their own sound team; they are their own press contacts; they manage their own merch table. Braids’ subscriptions to DIY practices makes them available, tangible people who are able to connect to audiences before and after they perform on stage, further encapsulating an already memorable performance while also circumventing some of the nastiness that emanates from the questionable behaviors of seedy venue men.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBraids is a band that genuinely loves what they do, their passion for their artform evident in their animated faces and body movements. Standell-Preston, frontwoman and primary vocalist, has an open, charismatic presence that completely filled the Echo. She was warm, collected, and content to share her work with a supportive audience. Due to the introspective, personal quality behind her lyrics, each word sang cut to the bone while interacting with the audience’s emotions in a relatable, visceral way. UCLA Radio had the immensive privilege of interviewing Raphaelle before their performance regarding the psychological trauma felt upon releasing a personal body of work, meditation, and the current status of women in the music industry. The full transcription of the interview can be read below.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: So you’re\nRaphaelle?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: I am Raphaelle!\n\u003ci\u003eLaughs\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: Cool.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: I am one of\nmany Raphaelles\u0026hellip;in the world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: How many do you\nthink there are in the world?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: Oh my gosh…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: A couple?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: I don’t know,\nbut I remember there was, there was a Raphaelle.

The boys really wanted to play it first\nand I was like, “no, like, please, can we put it later on in the set.” And\nthey’re like, “no we have to open with it!” And I was like “fine, but I’m going\nto blow my voice.” And I did. And then I sang on my, my voice kind of blown for\nthe rest of the show. Uhm, and today it really hurts. It feels like I\u0026hellip;it\nfeels like a pulled muscle, which I know is, it’s a bad thing. And like, “oh\nno, I hurt my throat.” So in that, I guess I carry around, like, I carry around\na special rock for my throat. But, it’s like, here….\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: What kind of\nrock is it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: It’s uhm, I\ncan’t remember what this stone is called.

Uhm, so, if I have time, which usually I don’t, I’ll try and\ndo, like, fit in another, like my second meditation of the day to be around,\nlike an hour before I play. Uhm, and that’s really nice and makes for a really\ngrounded set. I’m like a lot less jittery and like, more focused. Uhm, I’ve\nbeen trying to run on tour ‘cause I’m, I’m 26 now and I’m starting feel the\neffects of like, passing 25. \u003ci\u003eLaughs. \u003c/i\u003eJust\nlike, how my body feels a bit slower and like, feels a bit more pillowy, which\nis fine, but I just, you know, starting running, which I used to not have to.\nAnd just like, get your heart rate up when you’re sitting in the van for so\nlong.

Uhm, it does kind of feel like some sort of postpartum\ndepression, usually, but this one didn’t. But every other record I’ve released,\nI have like a huge breakdown or like a huge nervous energy comes about me when\nI release it and I think because I’m usually like, I usually question it just\nbecause like, once we release it finally, you’ve just had it with yourself for\nso long that\u0026hellip;it’s like when you do anything for too long, you just start to\nquestion it. It’s like if I could put it out the week after I finished\nrecording it, probably wouldn’t have that, but it’s like sitting on it. And\nsame with the last record, especially. I just wrote an essay about what it was\nlike to release “Miniskirt” and release that last record and just talking about\nlike the anxiety that surrounded coming out with that record.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: Interesting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: I don’t know,\nhave you, did you read the essay?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: No!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: Oh, okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: I have not. I\nwould like to though. Where is it available?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: It’s on\nPitchfork. It’s called “Reclamation Through a Microphone.” (\u003ca href=\"http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1129-reclamation-through-a-microphone-braids-raphaelle-standell-preston-on-how-songwriting-helped-her-process-sexual-abuse/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1129-reclamation-through-a-microphone-braids-raphaelle-standell-preston-on-how-songwriting-helped-her-process-sexual-abuse/\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: Cool!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: How do you deal\nwith the anxiety of releasing new work?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: Uhm,\nmeditation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: Meditation?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: Yeah. \u003ci\u003eLaughs. \u003c/i\u003eOr just, now that I’ve done it\nso many times, I’m just like, “okay I’m going to feel pretty weird for a little\nbit.” I guess, just like, being able to articulate it now that I’ve gone\nthrough it so many times really helps because before, it was like, I didn’t\nknow how to identify it. I was like, “oh I just feel really bad all of a\nsudden.” And like, I don’t want to talk about the process and usually the first\ncouple months of interviews are really hard and then you just get into the flow\nof things and like, you’re happy that people are interested. But yeah,\ndefinitely meditation has helped me a lot with many areas of my life including\nthat one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: Cool! I’m glad\nyou found something for that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: Yeah! I do a\ntype of meditation called transcendental meditation which I actually learned in\nLA at a Los Feliz location.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: Which one?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: Yeah, it’s\ncalled Transcendental Meditation Los Feliz.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: Oh, okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: Yeah, it’s like\na specific studio that they have there. They have other locations, I think in\nHollywood, but that’s my favorite one. Those are my favorite teachers for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: Well, hopefully\nthis interview isn’t too angst inducing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: Oh no! I don’t\nget anxious anymore. Not at all. Like, I’m fine. Like, it’s just, it’s honestly\njust like, and actually to come back to your question of like, releasing this\nrecord. I haven’t felt any kind of hesitation with it. I think it just happens\nwith getting older and just doing it a lot more. And yeah, like I said, being\nable to give your feelings a name, or a process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: I like that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: Well, do you\nhave any superstitions?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: Kind of. I\ndon’t know, I’m like you where I’m trying to believe in it, but don’t know if I\nactually do. I like to meditate as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: What kind of\nmeditation do you like to do?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: I don’t know.\nI’ve never…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: Just like a\nbunch? Or do you do guided?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: No, I’ve never\ndone guided. I just do it on my own.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: Oh, that’s\nreally cool. I have some friends who are like that where I’m like “oh, do you\nmeditate?” And they’re like “yeah.” And I’m like “well, what do you do?” And\nthey’re like “well, I just meditate.” And then, like, for me, it’s always been\nvery like, I guess, very understood of what it is I’m doing or guided or given\na term.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: Right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: Yeah, or like\npart of a certain sect of this kind of mediation. But that’s cool!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: So, last question.\nIt’s kind of, more personal I guess, so don’t feel like you have to it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: Okay!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: In light of\nstuff that’s been happening with Amber Coffman. Do you know Amber Coffman from\nthe Dirty Projectors?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: No, I don’t.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: Did you hear\nabout her PR\u0026hellip;their PR man, Heathcliff Berru. She recently outed him as a\nsexual offender.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: Oh, you should\ndefinitely read my essay because it’s all about that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: Oh, cool! Yeah,\nI’d love to read it. But yeah, in light of that and like, the Kesha\ncontroversy, I’m just curious if you experience any similar difficulties being\na woman fronting a band.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: Uh, yes and no.\nLike, I don’t know if I can necessarily pertain it to the music industry. I\nhave experienced sexual abuse in my earlier childhood, which I’ve come out\nabout recently. Which is really scary to come out about, but I’m happy it did.\nBut in terms of the music industry, I’ve had some people\u0026hellip;no I wouldn’t say\nI’ve had anything to that degree, at all. Like, I’ve had some shitty sound guys\nwho’ve made misogynistic comments to me. Not my current sound guy, obviously,\nbecause he’s with us for a reason and he’s like our best friend but like,\nbefore when we were kind of jumping around without a sound person, yeah I\ndefinitely have had some comments made towards me. I think that just\nunfortunately happens towards women. I think that we’re still on a path of\ntrying to reclaim, or claim, because we’ve never really been given it, the kind\nof respect that we deserve or, like, the kind of equality that we deserve. I’m\nreally happy though, that, I guess that people are paying more attention to it,\nbut there still is the\u0026hellip;there still is the unfortunate reality that like, when\nthese women come forward about these kind of events, that they’re questioned\nabout it and not believed and to me, I think that if anyone is to have said, of\ncourse if it doesn’t come from a vindictive place where you’re like, lying, but\nI don’t think that\u0026hellip;I have never known that to happen in a sexual assault case\nthat at least I’ve come across, but when a woman comes forward and says she’s\nbeing harassed, she’s being harassed. You know? And we should believe that and\nI hate that we question that. Very recently there was a case in Canada for an\ninterview host named Jian Ghomeshi. Did you hear about that shit?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: No!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: It was crazy.\nSo he was like, one of the most popular men in Canada, like, everybody loved\nhim. And these women\u0026hellip;oh he was actually asked to leave the CBC, which is the\nshow he was apart of, and these women came forward, a few of them I think with\ntheir names concealed, came forward saying he had beat them like on dates. He\nhad randomly, like, hit them and stuff and the amount of people who didn’t\nbelieve these women was just like, it was appalling. And also, in the court\nsystem too, like when you take a seuxal assult predator to court, they often\ntimes don’t have to testify. It’s the victims who are already very traumatized\nwho have to stand trial and who are questioned while the person who is at fault\njust looks and watches the whole thing from, you know, the audience or from the\nbench or whatever. So that’s shitty. The whole thing is shitty. The system\ndoesn’t work for dealing with sexual assault victims. And media doesn’t work\neither, I think, for helping sexual assault victims. I was actually really\nreally impressed with Pitchfork’s willingness to run the essay that I wrote and\nthe woman who helped me edit it from Pitchfork and I was just like, very, they\nwere just like very supportive and it gave me a lot of respect for them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: That’s cool!\nYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: Yeah so. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: Well, I’m glad\nthat you’ve never had to experience any of that firsthand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: Yeah, not in\nthe music industry. I’ve definitely been dealt my fair share of shitty male\nexperiences. But like, all the men in my life are wonderful, wonderful human\nbeings who are like, very loving and kind towards women.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: Cool!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: Yeah, I hope\nthat transcends to all people. \u003ci\u003eLaughs.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: Do you have any\nadvice for any women or any all-gender bands who are trying to get into the\nscenes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: Like it, oh,\nlike who are trying to like, I guess, what do you mean by scenes?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: I guess who are\njust trying to be working musicians.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: Yeah, I’d say\nthat like, as a women is all that I really speak to, but I would say that if\nyou ever feel uncomfortable, like, if you feel safe enough to say something,\nthen do and if you don’t, then try to remove yourself from the situation. And\njust don’t, like, I think it’s really important to shape your career based on\nyour values and people you want to work with. And like. Like, for me, if I get\na sense from somebody that they’re kind of dick and that they’re like, not\ngoing to treat me well, if it’s like a recording session or whatever than like,\neven if it could really benefit my career, I won’t work with them. Or if I look\ninto their, just like what it is they’ve believe in, whether it’s going on\ntheir Facebook or their Twitter. To me it’s really important to do a little bit\nof research into what the people you’re going to work with are kind of like,\nand just get a sense for them. I think that as a woman, it’s important that we\nstart standing up to that. With Kesha being like, no I don’t, even though it’s,\nwhat was his name, Dr. Luke? That’s the guy’s name that Kesha was\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: Oh yeah!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: Yeah, coming\nout against. He’s a very very powerful man and it was probably very scary to\ncome out against him because a lot of the times the men who are taking advantage\nof these women are in positions of huge power so it feels like, they have to,\nlike if they were to go against them that they would, they would maybe have\nnothing left or something. And I think that if we are able to stand together as\na people and as a force then it’s going to be a lot stronger in changing those\nkind of behaviors towards women in the music industry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: Right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: So yeah, I feel\nkind of conflicted sometimes when I like listening to rap and stuff that is\nreally misogynistic and that I like enjoy it, and I like singing along to it\nand I’m like, “oh shit, this is really not what I believe in.” And like, for me\nthat’s another conflict, is when it’s like\u0026hellip; Sometimes I’ll like\u0026hellip;I was doing\nthis track where I’m singing on this rap track and I like the sound of it and I\nlike the beat so much, but the lyrics are a little like, “eh,” you know? And\nit’s like, well, how do we separate the art from the people, and then there’s\nalso that kind of imbalance or balance that we need to strike, which is like,\ndo you want to separate the person, like if they’re a shitty person, or like,\nif maybe they’re an awesome person but they’re writing lyrics you don’t really\nwant to stand up for. So, it’s a whole like, it’s a whole like conundrum.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJ: It’s a paradigm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: Yeah exactly.\nLike, I love Katy Perry. She’s one of my favorite singers, but sometimes I’m\nlike, “really Katy? Did you really have to go and sing that? Did you have to go\nand say that?” \u003ci\u003eLaughs.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eR: Yeah I love\nher, but yeah there’s, I think there’s, I think that everything’s somewhat\nconflicting to a degree, like you can never be 100 percent Kosher, but you\ndefinitely should never tolerate anybody being abusive. You know? Like lyrics,\nto a degree, lyrics aren’t somebody hurting you. Or like somebody taking away\nyour, I don’t know this is getting even more philosophical than I feel you even\nasked me to get. I’m like, “hmmm.” \u003ci\u003eLaughs.\u003c/i\u003e\nBut, yeah, I think it’s really important to stand up against that. And like,\nyeah, if you feel uncomfortable like, remove yourself or speak with somebody or\nif you can, just point it out. Just bein like, “hey, I really don’t appreciate\nthat. I don’t respect that. Why’d you do that. Don’t do it again.”\u003c/p\u003e",

There’d be something a little.. “Off” about a guy that walks away from this exposé of delectable synths, enthusiastic vocal performances, and resounding grooves with anything less than joy in his heart.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eLast Thursday, Thibaut Berland (aka Breakbot) led his North American tour into Los Angeles for an electrifying set piece at the El Rey Theatre.  The curtains drew open to reveal a rather drab, simplistic scene.  Drenched in pale blue lighting, Berland’s trademark synth + keyboard setup stood elevated at the center of the stage with no one to pilot it.  Instead fans were greeted with a cinematic orchestral piece emanating from the venue’s humble sound system… “Is this Star Wars?\u0026ldquo;After a few more moments, Breakbot himself finally came out to greet his audience of juvenile House aficionados—A crowd yearning to get a taste for a sound developed long before their time.  Berland exchanged a shy wave hello for a resounding cheer from the audience, then began to put the pieces together at the keyboard.  His contribution to the \u003ci\u003eStar Wars Headspace\u003c/i\u003e album was an interesting choice for an opener, but it simply worked as an ample introduction.  Dazzling electronic shows would normally be limited by small stages like the kind sported by the El Rey, but Breakbot was fairly quick to prove that his music could certainly speak for itself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e“Star Tripper” immediately gave way to the second song of the night, “Back for More.”  Following the transition, Lights came up to reveal instrumental accompaniment, Berland’s cream-colored suit, and our pair of vocalists waltzing in from each side of the stage.  The latter introduced some much needed charisma to the stage, successfully balancing Breakbot’s characteristic awkwardness at the keys.  Despite being used to their vocals going through a ton of after-effects on the albums, Irfane and Yasmin’s vocal styles sounded right at home over the live versions of each subsequent track.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eSince Breakbot’s breakthrough single “Baby I’m Yours” in 2010, Irfane’s been around to provide his distinctive vocalizations over every stage of Berland’s excursion of the dance genre up to present day.  Yasmin however, seemed like a harder sell being as fans were just introduced to her back in February via Breakbot’s latest full-length, \u003ci\u003eStill Waters\u003c/i\u003e.Now I don’t know much about theater, but I do know that performers strive to be just as interesting to the back row as they are to the front.  Luckily Yasmin commanded the stage with the type of confidence that made her exciting to watch from all angles of the El Rey.  The way she interacted with the dancing teenagers in the front row felt nothing short of charming, and I was especially impressed at how she was able to reimagine older Ruckazoid-led Breakbot tracks such as “Why” and “Fantasy\u0026rdquo; in ways that were all her own.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eAnother commendable feature of the performance has to do with Breakbot’s actual mixing ability.  Of course, I should expect nothing less from such a renown DJ, but it was especially exciting for the audience to hear something like a remix of Pnau’s “Baby” gently give way to an old favorite like “One Out of Two.”  This live act relies on a predetermined setlist of course, but it was curious (and a little cute) to see Berland occasionally glance up with a concerned expression—An attempt to read the crowd for his own sake. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eI’m happy to report that the French House icon had very little to worry about. Songs that failed to win me over back when I reviewed \u003ci\u003eStill Waters\u003c/i\u003e were so effortlessly enjoyable in the context of a live performance.  The undeniable on-stage chemistry of the band coupled with some genuinely contagious grooves simply “sold” the show right off the bat.  It even got to the point that “Baby I’m Yours” somehow felt more refreshing on Thursday than when I first heard it through some cheap headphones back in high school English.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’ve been in the middle of many shows where I’m just begging for it to be over, even really good ones oddly enough.  At no point was this one of them.  While Breakbot’s latest musical efforts may be hit-or-miss for some, his live performance is definitely one of the most fun concert-going experiences you can have sober.  If you focus hard enough during some parts of the set, you can almost imagine tearing up the dance floor in a French discotheque yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eAn extended cut of “You Should Know” wrapped up the night.  With a few stray keyboard notes and a peace sign, Berland and his bandmates exited the stage just as coyly as they entered.  The houselights revealed a group of friends in front of me, freaking out over a CD booklet they had somehow gotten Irfane to sign in the middle of the encore—We had truly been a part of something remarkable, I suppose. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

I would mostly group his style with the likes of Fog Lake \u0026ndash; most with fairly soft vocals yet beautiful composition. With his new album Skip A Sinking Stone, Mutual Benefit returns to his singer-songwriting roots to create a melodic journey that is easy to listen to.

Rather the music is a bit more confessional sounding, and is good for listening to while studying, chilling, cleaning, or a late night drive on a road that is normally so busy yielded empty by the night hours. Misogi is a producer that brings some of the core elements of what \u0026ldquo;trap\u0026rdquo; started as back to life. The beats knock harder than radio hits, but you can feel the underground vibe coming from the full sound scape of the instrumental. There\u0026rsquo;s a really strong connection between any verses that are on the tracks and the emotion that is introduced by the beat in the beginning of each of the songs. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel as though it is the vocalist controlling the music in this way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"500\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/50c43a0e572d18ccb35b1fcd62c810d5/tumblr_inline_o821rmW7n91qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"500\" data-orig-height=\"500\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eLittle Green Cars - Ephemera\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eGenre: folk rock/indie rock\u003cbr/\u003eRecommended Song: \u0026ldquo;Easier Day\u0026rdquo;\u003cbr/\u003eThe vocalist in this band has a fairy-like voice and the way she sings is a nice mixture of frail but confident. The drums usually come in to build a lot of tension and then continue to set the pace one the guitarist or vocalist has laid down a mood within a song. Also, I noticed most of the guitar work in the album is pretty gentle which provides a very intimate setting for the bass guitar to carry along the vocals. The album has a strong fleeting feeling and picks up speed after the first third or so. Other great songs that I recommend on there are \u0026ldquo;The Party\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Good Women Do\u0026rdquo; because I really love the singer; she\u0026rsquo;s a freakin\u0026rsquo; rock star.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"1200\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d2f7e3a1f417bbefbacd2b84d9433634/tumblr_inline_o821sa3yvM1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1200\" data-orig-height=\"1200\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eTracy Bryant - Subterranean\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eGenre: psychedelic 50s garage rock\u003cbr/\u003eRecommended Song: \u0026ldquo;The Background Singer\u0026rdquo;\u003cbr/\u003e\u003ci\u003eSubterranean\u003c/i\u003e is (surprise) yet another psychedelic garage rock album, but is still a solid release.

into a puddle of despair, yet effervesces with unwavering fervor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis new Radiohead project follows 2011’s \u003ci\u003eThe King of Limbs\u003c/i\u003e, and a number of other Thom Yorke ventures including forming the supergroup Atoms for Peace, and releasing his 2014 solo LP \u003ci\u003eTomorrow’s Modern Boxes\u003c/i\u003e.  While each of the aforementioned efforts are commendable in their own right, they ultimately suffer from drab moods that fall short of being interesting in a full length release. \u003cbr/\u003eGiven Yorke’s recent musical direction, some fans worried that \u003ci\u003eA Moon Shaped Pool\u003c/i\u003e would again demonstrate that inorganic, mechanistic feel that has bogged down his recent projects.  Rest assured, a \u003ci\u003eKing of Limbs\u003c/i\u003e Part Deux it is not.  While it may require repeat listens, \u003ci\u003eA Moon Shaped Pool\u003c/i\u003e is both challenging and interesting enough to make this an inviting task.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe album opens with “Burn the Witch.”  While the track is seemingly simple, it’s immediately distinguishable by its dizzying chord progression: The instrumentation swells and climbs as ominous strings dominate in the background.  The track feels very new to start, yet familiar again as Yorke introduces himself via his characteristic croon.  With help of the lyrics, the result of the song is a very palpable sense of anxiety, and it’s a feeling that stretches for almost the whole length of the LP.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThat’s not to say that this album is entirely one-note, either.  Songs like “Desert Island Disk” cleverly layer the vocals over a folk guitar.  More interesting still is how this mixture sits over a bed of “droney,” astral sounds straight out of the Kid A era.  You’d never think that a concoction like “folk-drone” would work in theory, but perhaps a goal of \u003ci\u003eA Moon Shaped Pool\u003c/i\u003e is proving that Radiohead is still bold enough to pull it off.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut yes, Radiohead is just as sad we left them in 2011—Yet their dread evolved into something profound and almost refreshing five years later.  “Daydreaming,” possibly my favorite track on the record, continues the climb initiated by the opening track but in much slower strides.  It’s a piano-heavy song, but a faint glockenspiel tops off the track with Radiohead’s characteristic iciness. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe lyrics are also a definite highlight on this track as well.  Thom Yorke’s vocal style alone can be more attention grabbing at first however, especially as his voice distorts and plays in reverse toward the end of the song.  The result is beautiful, yet strikingly sinister all the same.  “Daydreaming” is my favorite not just because of its understated beauty, but because I feel it’s indicative of the album’s primary strengths: Detail and subtlety.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs I mentioned before, \u003ci\u003eA Moon Shaped Pool\u003c/i\u003e demands subsequent play throughs.  While definitely a “grower,” the LP’s primary incentives are the intricate details you won’t catch with a cursory listen.  Almost as enjoyable as the songs themselves is the “picking apart” of each moment.  If you think of this album as a delicate piece of machinery, then the listening experience resembles examining the cogs that make it work, and effectively creating a blueprint in reverse.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf this album suffers from any shortcomings, it’s definitely the fact that the sounds more or less meld together after the first handful of tracks.  While this aspect is appealing to some, for casual listening purposes, the LP may be too subtle for its own good.  As a result, I wouldn’t blame any Radiohead fans that chastise this record for being too slow.  It would require some some divine multitasking skills however, to be pulled away from “Daydreaming,” or better yet, the closer “True Love Waits.”  While its just as deceptively simple as its predecessors, this could be one of Radiohead’s most devastating tracks in their entire catalogue. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFans can breathe a much deserved sigh of relief in that this LP isn’t the soundtrack to yet another Brit-Rock band well past their prime.  \u003ci\u003eA Moon Shaped Pool \u003c/i\u003ewasn’t released to fulfill an album quota, but rather, to push the envelope just another inch further—An astonishing feat by a band as erratic and boundary pushing as Radiohead. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Released May 6, 2016, James Blake’s third album The Colour in Anything fuses moody electronics, graceful orchestral pieces, and haunting soul to ultimately deliver something greater than the sum of these parts and a style that is all his own.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA seventeen track record wherein almost every single song is slow, dreamy, and lamenting, The Colour in Anything risks being boring or losing its listeners in a haze of echoing songs that blur into each other. But impressively, Blake’s dynamic melodies and the somber, enchanting timbre of his voice breathe life into every song, preventing tracks from becoming repetitive despite overarching similarities in tempo and lyrical themes. Each song manages to bring a new dimension to the LP, whether it’s from an engaging synth drum hook (“Choose Me”) or a new insight written about a relationship destined to end (“f.o.r.e.v.e.r.”). \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eLyrically, the album grounds itself around the central theme of ephemerality and how awareness of this ephemerality affects our relationships. Songs like “The Colour in Anything” and “Radio Silence” despair over the decay of a fleeting, irretrievable love. But in one of my favorite lines of the album, Blake expresses the larger, more optimistic perspective of the album: “I suggest you love like love’s no loss” (“Waves Know Shores”). And here lies the deeper significance of Blake’s album, which is the importance of not guarding oneself from love regardless of its inevitable end. The Colour in Anything acknowledges the idea that nothing lasts but responds not through mourning but rather acceptance, creating a message that is nostalgic and reflective without being tortured.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn a more critical note, although the experimental electronic notes and rhythms are what many see as Blake’s trademark sound, I don’t think that they are what make the album strong. To me, the captivating lyrical refrains and Blake’s own poignant voice are what elevate the music and produce connection with the listener. The dubstep elements at their best are fascinating in songs such as “Always” and “My Willing Heart” but distracting at their worst in a song like “Put That Away And Talk To Me,” in which a beeping telephone ringtone repeats throughout the song. I suppose it is possible that this ringing noise is some sort of sonic metaphor used to reassert themes of missed communication, and I am simply not in tune with these sublime, higher meanings. However, for now I will continue to view the recurring beeping as one of the several instances where electronic influence falls short and reduces the overall quality of the album’s tracks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut apart from the occasionally extraneous dubstep loops, I think this is a beautiful album. Blake balances abstract and experimental instrumentals with a vulnerable yet passionate vocal performance to present a melancholy but not bitter portrait of love amidst loss.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

The first part of the story can be found at \u003ca href=\"http://goo.gl/AyJrCT\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://goo.gl/AyJrCT\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I clicked on his page I was shocked by what I saw: reposts of all of my tracks.\nEven the b-sides. Even the chopped ’n’ screwed field recordings of Cavalia’s Odysseo (which is\na must see, by the way—you wouldn’t believe the kind of equine acrobatics that are possible\ntoday). I scrolled through the Swedish producer’s page now existing as an echo of my own. His\nlatest track was titled, “For Horse Girl.” It couldn’t have been for anyone else. Overcome with a\nthrobbing flutter of butterflies in my stomach, I hit play. A sultry female voice (think: Kučka)\nscatted over a lively cumbia-inspired synth—an obvious nod to my hispanic heritage. As the\nsong crescendoed I realized that the lyrics were being played in reverse. Do the lyrics contain\nsome sort of subliminal message? A love letter, maybe?\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI found an online track reverser to begin decoding the enigma, but I didn’t realize what I\nhad just gotten myself into. Even with the track reversed, the lyrics became no less clear: it was\nsung in a language not immediately familiar to me, one long unheard by the ears of the masses.\nThe words sent chills and my hairs spiked up like a cat who has encountered a cucumber. As I\nlooped the track, the phonemes sublimated into packages reminiscent of Hebrew. I began to trace\nthe etymology of Hebrew, clicking from the “Semitic languages” page through “ancient Semitic\nspeakers” to arrive at a page on “Aramaic.” A sonic sampling of the language confirmed my\nsuspicion: the recording was in fact spoken in Aramaic. Naturally, I was entangled by questions\nseemingly only one person could answer.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI snapped to my computer desk and selected the “soundcloud.com” shortcut on my\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBookmarks Bar. A quick search of the Swedish producer left me haunted. His page was barren. It\nwas stripped of all reposts, likes, and sounds; except for one. A solitary song remained: “Error\n404.”\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo be continued.\n\u003c/p\u003e",

Yet as a 90s child and Yankee fan, I’d be remised to say that while Derek Jeter will forever be known as the captain, the real heart and soul of the Yankee Dynasty roamed right field for nine seasons, number 21, Paul O’Neill.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAcquired from the Yankees in 1993 for Roberto Kelly, O’Neill immediately had huge shoes to fill, replacing fan-favorite and Yankee captain Don Mattingly as the team’s number three hitter. Pauley, as he has come to be known amongst Yankee fans, immediately responded, rattling off the first of what would be six straight .300 seasons as the anchor of the lineup. On the field, O’Neill blossomed while in the Bronx, reaching four all star games, winning the 1994 batting title, and driving in over 100 runs in a season four times.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile Pauley was certainly no slouch on the field, it was off the field where he made his true mark as a Yankee. Known as a fiery competitor, no water cooler or bat was ever safe from O’Neill’s wrath, as he was prone to competitive outbursts that often left destruction in their path. O’Neill’s love of the game and competitiveness was on full display in the 1999 World Series, where hours after his father passed of a heart attack, Pauley took the field with his teammates. O’Neill’s drive made him a fan favorite, prompting Yankee owner George Steinbrenner to label him as a “Warrior,” and led Yankee Stadium to chant his name in unison in Game 5 of the 2001 World Series, where he responded by tipping his cap to the crowd, tears flowing down his face and all in his last home game in the Bronx.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, the biggest impact O’Neill made in his time, as a Yankee was a change in the franchise’s culture. When O’Neill joined the squad, the Yankees had not reached the postseason in twelve years; by the time he left, they had appeared in five World Series in a six-year span, winning four. At a time when the entire Yankees franchise desperately needed a spark, O’Neill not only brought leadership, but also a winning attitude to a team that was in desperate need of a jolt in the right direction. He may not be the most well known Yankee of all time, but without a doubt, Paul O’Neill will go down in Pinstripe lure with the likes of Mantle, Ruth, and DiMaggio in the eyes of Yankee fans.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By\u003c/i\u003e: Chase Madorksy, UCLA Radio Sports DJ (02/21/16)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLos Angeles- In a game where Pauley Pavilion was graced with three Naismith Player of the Year Winners and National Champions, all of whom have their jerseys hanging from the rafters in Bill Walton, Sidney Wicks, and Marques Johnson, the UCLA Bruins Men’s Basketball Team (14-12, 5-8) fell to the Utah Utes (20-7, 9-5)  by a score of 75-73 in the first matchup between the two programs this season. Utah, winners of seven of their last nine contests heading into tonight, was looking to avenge last year’s 69-59 upset at the hands of the Bruins in Westwood. On the opposite bench, UCLA hoped to build off of a 78-65 victory against the Arizona State Sun Devils, while attempting to achieve their first winning streak since January 9. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The first half was a back and forth affair, with the score tied at 31 following fourteen lead changes and six ties throughout the first twenty minutes of play. The Bruins, who’s largest lead of the first half was four points, shot 42% from the field (13-31), but were hindered by making only 4-13 shots from three. For Utah, who stayed neck and neck with the Bruins early on by shooting 41% and by out-rebounding the Bruins 20-17, the first half key was attacking the paint early and often, with twelve of their sixteen two-pointers in the first half coming from inside. Both teams played an extremely efficient half on defense, committing a combined eight fouls which led to only six free throws being attempted in the first half of play.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009In the second half, the Utes came out firing, as with the score tied at 36 at the 18:04 mark, Utah went onto a 21-7 run that pushed their lead to 57-43 with 10:51 left in the game. After the game, Bruins Coach Steve Alford had this to say about the run, “The first fourteen minutes of the second half were crucial and we didn’t play well.” For the rest of the game, it was all Bruins, where an offensive attack led by Isaac Hamilton and Bryce Alford produced a 25-13 UCLA run, cutting the deficit to a two point Bruin disadvantage with 2:30 remaining. However, from there Brandon Taylor hit a clutch three at the top of the key with fifteen seconds on the clock to push the Utes lead to 73-68. Following a Thomas Welsh mid-range jumper with six seconds to play, the Bruins found themselves down three points. On the ensuing inbounds pass, Utah forward Kyle Kuzma snuck past the Bruin defense, creating an outlet on a long pass and giving himself a wide open lane which allowed him to slam home the finishing touches of a 75-73 Utah win. Regarding the breakdown of the final Utah inbounds play, Coach Alford stated, “There was obviously some breakdown, because we talk about at least one guy going long.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009While the Bruins came up just short, there were bright spots to be taken out of a tough loss. Junior guard Isaac Hamilton continued his strong season, scoring twenty-five points to lead all scorers while also contributing five rebounds. Following the loss, Hamilton displayed his emerging leadership skills, telling his team, “We need to come in and play hard for a full forty. They scored 26 points (in the first eight minutes) and it was hard for us to come back once they did.” In addition to Hamilton, Bryce Alford, Tomas Welsh, and Aaron Holiday all finished in double digit scoring, with newly added starter Jonah Bolden filling the stat sheet with seven points, five rebounds, and two blocks. At the post game press conference, point guard Bryce Alford offered praise for his team, saying, “This is a team that fights, which is something that I’m very proud of and love about this team.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009For Utah, Player of the Year Candidate Jakob Poeltl led the way with fifteen points and eleven rebounds, consistently having his way with the Bruin’s interior defense. The seven foot forward from Australia proved why many project him as a potential first round pick in the NBA Draft, displaying a bevy of low post moves while anchoring Utah’s low post game on both sides of the ball. Jordan Loveridge was the leading scorer for Utah with seventeen points, one of four Utes in double figures for the evening. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Ultimately, the Bruins ran out of time in this one, which Coach Alford described in saying, “There run to start the second half was longer than our run was-our run came a little to late.” A common theme in the postgame press conference for the Bruins was the lack of consistency the team has displayed of late, with Bryce Alford even going as far as proclaiming that “We go through stretches where I feel like we’re one of the best teams in the country, and then we go through stretches where anyone can beat us.” The Bruins proved late that when they get hot, they can match up with any team in the nation; hopefully in the near future, that passion and fire can be spread out over the course of forty minutes rather than in short spurts as the team attempts to live up to their full potential. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The Bruins host the Colorado Buffaloes at home on Saturday, February 20, 2016 at 8:00 PM Pacific Time, while Utah plays at USC this Sunday, February 21\u003csup\u003est\u003c/sup\u003e at 3:00 PM Pacific Time. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009 \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTeam Stats (All stats courtesy of UCLA Basketball Statistics Department) \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eUCLA Bruins\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFG%: 29-61, 47.5%\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3FG%: 11-23, 47.8%\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFT%: 4-5, 80%\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTotal Rebounds: 31\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOffensive Rebounds: 7\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTotal Assists: 15\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTotal Points: 73\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTotal Turnovers: 10\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTotal Blocks: 3\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTotal Steels: 2\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePoints in the Paint: 24\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePoints off turnovers: 10\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecond Chance Points: 11\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFast Break Points: 2\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBench Points: 10 \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eUtah Utes\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFG%: 31-62, 50%\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3FG%: 9-22, 40.9%\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFT%: 4-8, 50%\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTotal Rebounds: 35\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOffensive Rebounds: 9\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTotal Assists: 18\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTotal Points: 75\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTotal Turnovers: 8\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTotal Blocks: 2\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTotal Steels: 6\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePoints in the Paint: 40\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePoints off turnovers: 11\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecond Chance Points: 10\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFast Break Points: 8\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBench Points: 10 \u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Does Whiteness Month belong in College?  // UCLA Radio News Op-Ed",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By\u003c/i\u003e: Nicole Jewell, UCLA Radio DJ (02/08/16)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“White privilege” is a hot topic throughout colleges, especially with recent political and social movements such as \u003ci\u003eBlack Lives Matter\u003c/i\u003e; redirecting our attention to how we currently treat racial issues. A community college in Portland, Oregon, has implemented a unique way to teach about the social structures of white privilege. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFaculty and staff at PCC have devised to make April a “Whiteness History Month,” attempting to “change [the] campus climate,” by breaking down the “racial power structure” derived from white privilege. Of course this has caused a lot of controversy, with an interpretation that this is simply a “white-shaming month,” and if will have a positive result on the student body. According to the school’s website, PCC has “90,000 students\u0026hellip;making it Oregon’s largest college,” providing some insight as to why they would choose this college to represent such a significant social statement. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eA subcommittee of diversity at the school were discussing changes that the campus could make, but during this last MLK monday, the “discussion went viral.” Some questions thrown around were: “‘Who benefits from the consequences of whiteness? Who loses from whiteness? How?\u0026ldquo; or \u0026quot;In what ways does whiteness emerge from a legacy of imperialism, conquest, colonialism and the American enterprise?’” Those that support the cause are grateful for the school’s innovative take, and feel as though it will make an important contribution to the subject of racism on the campus. It makes one wonder if UCLA could benefit from an event like this, given this past year’s social, racial movements that have flooded the campus. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUCLA’s recent sparks of racial awareness and movement makes it difficult to predict what reactions would occur, if the campus was to have a “White History Month.”According to UCLA admissions, UCLA undergraduate acceptance demographics are: 4% African American, .5% American Indian, 33.5% Asian/Pacific Islander, 19.1% Hispanic, 27.1% White, 3.1% Domestic, 12.6% International. Based on these percentages, who’s to say that a “White History Month” is justifiable? Is it the awareness that UCLA would be getting across, or the isolation of one racial group? Granted, the reasoning for movements like this is because of violence happening in our world, or one race being singled out from admissions, or just a general over or underexposure of one race. But is it really necessary to dedicate an entire month to teach about white privilege, or is it a serious issue that needs to be addressed? Do students really not understand white privilege, or do they abuse it? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe attempts for PCC is to “change the climate,” and to really get to expose the social structure of whiteness is. Implying that students aren’t actually aware, and that this dramatic of an event will properly educate them goes a bit too far. True, maybe not all students consider their white privilege for what it is, is it not safe to assume that at least a majority of the student body does? If  UCLA needs a “White History Month,” then there is still a lot of work the student body needs to do. Is “white privilege” overlooked on UCLA’s campus, or is it an issue that can be left alone? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSource: “White History Month” Stirs Up Controversy at Oregon College\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuthor: Michael McLaughlin,\u003ci\u003e Huffington Post\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

At The Disco were barely out of high school, they wrote an unusual song about a wedding gone awry (“I Write Sins Not Tragedies”) that reached number 7 on the Billboard 100 and made them as famous as their peers My Chemical Romance and Fall Out Boy. Ten years later, Panic! At the Disco has gone through some changes—vocalist Brendon Urie is the only member left and the exclamation point is back—but their frantic, baroque approach to pop punk remains, and, for the most part, still sounds fresh on their fifth record, \u003ci\u003eDeath of A Bachelor.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003ePromotion for \u003ci\u003eDeath of a Bachelor\u003c/i\u003e has focused on the new Frank Sinatra influence on Panic!’s sound. This is most evident on the title track, where Brandon Urie croons about his recent marriage. Its hard to resist that falsetto when he sings, \u003ci\u003e“How could I ask for more?/ A lifetime of laughter/ At the expense of the death of a bachelor.” \u003c/i\u003eThe range and charisma in Urie’s voice is Panic!’s secret weapon and the reason they can adopt styles from the Beatles, Queen and Sinatra without sounding put on. Unfortunately, there are points on the record where Panic! strays too far from their usual style to sound genuine, like on the lead single “Victorious”, where they give in to the recent trend of former emo bands making songs you can pregame to. “Don’t Threaten Me With A Good Time” is another misguided attempt at a club song.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’ve been a Panic! fan in the past, there are definitely some real gems/jams here. Check out “Impossible Year”, “Death of a Bachelor”,  “Hallelujah”, “The Good, The Bad and The Dirty” and “Golden Days”. Even with a couple of clear misses, \u003ci\u003eDeath of a Bachelor\u003c/i\u003e will make your inner mall kid happy.\u003c/p\u003e",

Iñárritu creates a fictional representation of Hugh Glass that honors the myth as its foundation while still taking license with creativity and narrative.  Stories of the film shoot itself have drifted through and around Hollywood all year as the budget ballooned and delays set back delivery and release dates more than once.  While it may not be the Apocalypse Now of its generation it wouldn’t be entirely inaccurate to say that the film came to represent a bit of a mythical white whale – its legend grew bigger over time but no one had actually seen it.   When it finally hit theaters early this month in wide release, I didn’t know what to expect but I was hoping for a lot. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe review: The Revenant delivers natural vistas on a scale that you probably won’t see again for a long time. Shot on digital using an Alex Arria 65 and lenses between 12 and 21mm – it has a visual crispness and scope within frames that creates a sense of being in the scene with the actors, in the forest, under the snow, plunging over cliffs, facing down a bear.  The immediacy of the environment becomes the lead actor, and you can’t take your eyes off of it.  The beauty of the land and its role in the story as it evolves makes the visual aspect of this film primary in a way that is more that it would be in another.  It deserves to be seen as a film that changes how we understand film itself. As an expression of what is possible, this movie makes full use of every advantage that technology and the accumulated experience of Hollywood offers. \u003cbr/\u003eThe Revenant is a serious movie.  It doesn’t go for laughs and it doesn’t present you with any inside jokes. Hugh Glass is a man wronged and conflicted, living between two worlds and tragically deprived of the one person who anchored him in the land of the living. The narrative draws deeply from elemental symbolism and mythologies that invoke a sense of Hugh Glass as a man who has died more than once, and who is honor bound to stay on the earthly plane in pursuit of revenge.  At times it feels larger than it needs to be, often balanced out by moments of deafening stillness and quiet.  The heartbreak of the man’s situation and indeed of the all of the men around whom the film revolves is apparent and plainly articulated, yet moving from scene to scene more often than not it was the visual aspects that compelled my eye to follow.  \u003cbr/\u003eWhen I did feel compelled to give my attention to the characters it was always attached to the American fascination with the wilderness man.  Hugh Glass’ scramble for survival would put Bear Grylls to shame, and it stands as a testament to research  and commitment to authenticity that certain scenes unfold the way that they do.  The fear of the white trappers attacked by Native Americans on the frontier is palpable and offers what might be the most original and authentic interpretation to date of what this type of fight would have looked and sounded like. Leonardo DiCaprio gives so much of himself it’s a wonder there is anything left after a performance as wrenching and visibly exhausting as any that have ever been put to film.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter all is said and done while still determined to not reveal too much, I can say that The Revenant  delivers.  If you’re squeamish it’s not for you. If you abhor violence its not for you. If you want a sense of an America long gone but whose beauty refuses to quit our imagination or our storytelling tradition, check it out.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Victoria Legrand first spoke in her sultry voice, saying: “Welcome to soirée número dos.” To address the night as a soirée was especially apt, considering the waltzing sway of songs like “PPP” and “Astronaut” entreating the audience to join in the movement.

It was clear they were not to present the best of their new work, with the occasional throwback thrown in, but rather to show the depth of their oeuvre’s thematic and sonic capabilities. Perhaps each of the four nights were completely unique in style and selection, but I would bet that each directed the audience toward the same unifying feeling.

But were you like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, I want to play this?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eMG: Yeah, I mean I did want to do that, but growing up where I lived we had a community center that had a New Orleans style brass band. They kind of had other kids playing instruments and since they had other kids there, then I wanted to do it. They would kind of restrict me from doing it because I had never had an instrument, I wasn\u0026rsquo;t in school playing music\u0026hellip;I was 5 years old, they were just like, \u0026ldquo;No, you\u0026rsquo;re not playing.\u0026rdquo; I remember I came in to a gig one time with a recorder and they started laughing at me because I had a recorder and everyone else had actual instruments: trumpets, trombones\u0026hellip;So I kind of felt out of place, but as soon as I got a horn, I was so happy and fell in love with it. I just loved playing it.\u003cbr/\u003eKT: I\u0026rsquo;ve spoken with you before and you\u0026rsquo;re always talking about this community center that you grew up in. Were you always in it? Did your parents always put you in this community center? What\u0026rsquo;s up with that?\u003cbr/\u003eMG: Growing up in Camden, when I was younger you always wanted to do stuff because you would always just see bad things happening and you just wanted to be a kid and have fun all the time. So I kept riding by a little community center, at night there were always people there. They had tons of trophies in the window. So one day I just said to my mom, \u0026ldquo;Hey I want to do karate.\u0026rdquo; She was like, \u0026ldquo; You want to do karate?\u0026rdquo; (laughs) It started as a karate school when I went, and as soon as I got information and started doing karate, I started seeing the other options and outlets that they had to offer. From karate, to the brass band, to African dancing and drumming classes, they were basically a scheduled thing. But once you went to the classes there were also performances you had to go to for those classes.\u003cbr/\u003eKT: So how long were you in karate though? Like do you have a black belt or something? (laughs)\u003cbr/\u003eMG: Yeah, I actually have a first degree black belt. (laughs)\u003cbr/\u003eKT: You said that you were introduced to music instrumentally through New Orleans Brass Band. You play the sax now and everything, do you think the elements of the New Orleans Brass Band is apparent in your music now?\u003cbr/\u003eMG: Yeah. (laughs) It\u0026rsquo;s just that a lot of the things from New Orleans band music is instrumental, but even now with their contemporary type of music, that\u0026rsquo;s on the radio\u0026hellip;You won\u0026rsquo;t know, but it\u0026rsquo;ll be a instrumental song, but with a hip hop feel or they\u0026rsquo;ll kind of make a remake of a song like \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s Get It On\u0026rdquo; by Marvin Gaye and make it more into a contemporary style of music. If you\u0026rsquo;re listening to that style, it\u0026rsquo;ll really help because you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to bring instrumentation along with rap and vocal lyrics and bring them together as much as possible. So when I do do that, it\u0026rsquo;s me bringing a new feel of hip hop, that people don\u0026rsquo;t really know of. That\u0026rsquo;s all I\u0026rsquo;m really trying to do. Just hearing what I know.\u003cbr/\u003eKT: With a lot of people, especially musicians, I like to ask, \u0026ldquo;What would you define as an artist?\u0026rdquo; A lot of answers I usually get are following your own way and making work for you. With you saying, \u0026ldquo;I like to take the brass band sound and infuse it into hip hop and do what I want to do\u0026rdquo;, would you define that as what an artist is? How would you define what an artist is?\u003cbr/\u003eMG: I would say, you\u0026rsquo;re focusing on yourself, but at the same time, you\u0026rsquo;re focusing on someone who\u0026rsquo;s listening because you\u0026rsquo;re taking an aspect now of, \u0026ldquo;Oh, that sounds good!\u0026rdquo;, you have to know how to relate to that person. As much as possible. Me being a male, I should know how to relate to man, female, boy, girl, anybody that can know a message. If you\u0026rsquo;re able to do that, the best artists should be able to do that. Just relate to somebody who is hearing what you make. Through your story, they can hear a similar story of their own. So they can say, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, I relate.\u0026rdquo; For instance, somebody like Drake or Erykah Badu doing \u0026ldquo;Hotline Bling\u0026rdquo;, doing those lyrics might really mean something for them, but for someone listening it might mean something deep to them too. Like you start singing the lyrics, like you\u0026rsquo;re the one who made the lyrics! (laughs) That\u0026rsquo;s how it\u0026rsquo;s really supposed to be. The listener is really in tune and engaged, \u0026ldquo;Oh yeah, this is me all the way. I want to mess with this person, because there\u0026rsquo;s a part of me that I hear or see in you.\u0026rdquo; Energies and vibes, music kind of enhances all of that too, so when you bring all of that together it shapes a great artist.\u003cbr/\u003eKT: Who are you listening to right now, or it doesn\u0026rsquo;t even have to be a musician, but artist wise who are you listening to, who are you watching, who are you looking at, who represents\u0026hellip;Who\u0026rsquo;s kind of an inspiration to you? As far as this whole idea of an artist is concerned?\u003cbr/\u003eMG: There\u0026rsquo;s different aspects. You have people like J. Cole or Kendrick Lamar that are more conscious and they\u0026rsquo;re hip hop artists or poets basically, telling a story. But then you have new artists as far D.R.A.M. or Goldlink. Goldlink is a great artist because you hear what he has through his music a lot, especially when he\u0026rsquo;s writing. Different people. I just listen to a lot of different things. SZA, Iman Omari, even producers like Sango or KAYTRANADA, the music is more of an energy that they have. When you feel that or what their brand is or what they\u0026rsquo;re trying to show, that has a lot of importance as an artist. You know, the more you push your brand and what your brand is showing is what can bring an artist out more. \u003cbr/\u003eKT: When somebody asks you what type of music are you into or who you\u0026rsquo;re listening to right now, it\u0026rsquo;s such a hard question. \u003cbr/\u003eMG: Yeah, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re trying to create new music. It\u0026rsquo;s really ambiguous. I mean with me, majority of the time we\u0026rsquo;re listening to the same people so I\u0026rsquo;m always trying to put someone on to different or new people. For someone to be like, \u0026ldquo;Oh! I\u0026rsquo;ve never heard of them before. You\u0026rsquo;re listening to them? Let me see who that is.\u0026rdquo; Because I know when other people do that for me, it broadens my horizons to see new people. My manager, Amanda, listens to so many different people and reggae like Buju Banton, all these different people that are crazy. She really helps me listen to different things. I\u0026rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of Diplo and Major Lazer stuff and looking at how he\u0026rsquo;s, in my opinion, an all around artist. His visuals and music aren\u0026rsquo;t really in relation to him, it relates to emotions and feelings and problems people go through.\u003cbr/\u003eKT: Yeah, actually one thing I love about Major Lazer or Diplo was the fact that he\u0026rsquo;s so creative. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if it comes on anymore, but he had this cartoon on Fox that revolved around his character, Major Lazer. Every episode was something different\u0026hellip;\u003cbr/\u003eMG: Yeah! I remember there was one where they were trying to legalize marijuana. (laughs)\u003cbr/\u003eKT: Yeah! Then there was another one where there was this Professor that stole the beat drop in all of music and concentrated it into one Beat Drop. (laughs)\u003cbr/\u003eMG: A good thing too, is that he displays his music in the cartoon, either throughout or at the end and there\u0026rsquo;s always a message at the end of those shows. People like that are always going to make money because they can basically appeal to anyone and not just one demographic of people. The whole world can get something out of watching Major Lazer, either from knowing exactly who he is or who Diplo is. That\u0026rsquo;s something I would really want for my music, to have anything that can relate to people because then you know you\u0026rsquo;re doing something good in the world. Getting paid for it too is the best thing. (laughs)\u003cbr/\u003eKT: You actually went into my next question which is, what do you want people to take away from your music? At the end of the day?\u003cbr/\u003eMG: Right now, with me playing different types of music, from Trap to Wavy R\u0026amp;B and Soul music to Commercialized Pop music, I just want people to hear what it can do for them. Since music can heal the soul, I know that some people have heard me play and it brings a warmness to their soul basically. I want it to be very moving or heartfelt or touching. I want that through all realms whether producing, performing, music video, anywhere you hear me, you\u0026rsquo;ll be like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, this is going to keep me right where I need to be.\u0026rdquo; \u003cbr/\u003eKT: What is your end goal with your music? Whether that\u0026rsquo;s career wise or your end goal in life with your art. Where do you find the progression in your art?\u003cbr/\u003eMG: Mostly, for right now, through the brand. In the future, I think more personally. Me not only portraying good music and making touching music, but telling my story. Where it becomes personal, that\u0026rsquo;s where the relation comes from and will transpire through my music. Like Erykah Badu who tells her story, whereas Beyonce makes feel good music, there\u0026rsquo;s a difference. Letting people know my journey.\u003cbr/\u003eKT: I know this is different for every artist, as far as the question of fame and everything, but would you be happy selling out stadiums\u0026hellip;\u003cbr/\u003eMG: Of course. Of course. I would want to do that because I\u0026rsquo;ve been performing in stages and stadiums since I was younger, so me doing my own thing like that would be\u0026hellip;I mean if I told you all the things I did and performed in when I was younger you\u0026rsquo;d be like, \u0026ldquo;Wow, why are you even standing here right now.\u0026rdquo; I did things such as performing at the Million Man March, I went to West Africa, Guinea, and performed for their cultural festival where we performed with Les Ballets Africains, performed at Brooklyn Academy of Music so many times, just did\u0026hellip;So many things I\u0026rsquo;ve done, put with fame can inspire somebody else. Tupac said, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t want to be the one who does it, but be the one who sparks the brain that does.\u0026rdquo; I want to do that, but more consciously. I want to be an intellectual black man from the hood that does this. Kendrick Lamar kind of did it, but he\u0026rsquo;s not college educated. J. Cole kind of did it. 2 Chainz actually graduated as valedictorian, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t portray it on where he\u0026rsquo;s at right now. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to do that being at one of the best universities in the world and still trying to get it out there.\u003cbr/\u003eKT: You\u0026rsquo;re speaking of making sure your intelligence is apparent in your work and your brand and everything, what\u0026rsquo;s your process as far as making art is concerned? You sound like you have a lot loaded in your work. How do you make sure you get this all in your work?\u003cbr/\u003eMG: First off, how do I feel? Then after how I feel, the intent comes along. Like why would I feel like this or why I would think somebody would feel like this? I\u0026rsquo;m always thinking about that one person who might be feeling that song or who might this song be for. Then once I start writing, it becomes more personal, but other than that it\u0026rsquo;s feelings first, intentions second. I just apply what I do from the intention.\u003cbr/\u003eKT: That\u0026rsquo;s interesting because I know a lot of people that work that backwards. (laughs) The intention is first, then my feelings, what do I intend for this to say and then my feelings involved in that.\u003cbr/\u003eMG: Well I mean, Joey Bada$$, who\u0026rsquo;s another person too as the main inspiration. Maybe because we\u0026rsquo;re both Aquariuses, which is crazy (laughs), but he sums it up the best, \u0026ldquo;If it don\u0026rsquo;t hit my spirit, then I don\u0026rsquo;t get near it.\u0026rdquo; So if I don\u0026rsquo;t feel it then I\u0026rsquo;m not even going to want to be near it or do it. I have to feel it first. If I don\u0026rsquo;t feel it then I know somebody else isn\u0026rsquo;t going to do feel it. Then once I feel it, the intentions automatically start coming. Feeling is really key.\u003cbr/\u003eKT: A little bit off topic, but mentioning Joey Bada$$, you actually remind me a lot of him and even your group puts off the same vibe that his does. With that being said, you are in a group, Westwood Village Ent., that\u0026rsquo;s full of different people from everywhere, so how\u0026rsquo;d ya\u0026rsquo;ll meet? \u003cbr/\u003eMG: It really started when I started hanging out with Ace Mack, who\u0026rsquo;s a fourth year rapper who goes here, and one day he was just saying, \u0026ldquo;My dad used to engineer for Tupac,\u0026rdquo; and he was from out of Sacramento so I was just thinking, \u0026ldquo;Ayee we gotta link.\u0026rdquo; I linked up with him and he introduced me to Lyon. Lyon was in another group called Wild Tribe, which was Pro Era-ish a little bit, but it was more so that they were all rappers. When I got closer to him and Lyon though, it became more of us making music. We then found out that Lyon\u0026rsquo;s a Gemini, I\u0026rsquo;m an Aquarius, we really started clicking more and making music. So from there he was supposed to be making a mixtape called Westwood Village, and I was like, \u0026ldquo;Wow, this should be a group.\u0026rdquo; (laughs) Plus, that was when Ani came (Indigenous Soul) and we started doing more stuff together. I started paying more attention to a lot of the artists who were around me and realizing that we should do a collective. Knowing that Ani sings and that Lyon raps, we came together and made a song called \u0026ldquo;So High\u0026rdquo;. We haven\u0026rsquo;t recorded it, but we play it live all the time. From there, the flame was lit. \u003cbr/\u003eWhen me and Lyon moved in together, we met Bashir, and came to find out that he was also from New Jersey, North New Jersey, making it an East Coast connection. So, that\u0026rsquo;s when Sky Season came about too. Right now, Westwood Village is like the overhead, since it\u0026rsquo;s more of the business of everything, but everything else is more independent. Like our independent artists such as Indigenous Soul, Lyon, Chris Winston, Munir Griffin, Alec Be, Christopher Pree, we have so many people that want to be a part of what we\u0026rsquo;re doing which is making good music. I mean we  even have amazing musicians such as Rameen Abrahams, who\u0026rsquo;s a dope bass player. Him and his brother just got finished doing something for Red Bull, the soccer team\u0026rsquo;s half time show in New York, he did something for the Clippers playing the National Anthem. He\u0026rsquo;s really dope. We just have so many different outlets of people, who want to use their talents.\u003cbr/\u003eBut mainly I want there to be a music culture or artistic culture that people after us can come here and get into, even after I graduate. Like, \u0026ldquo;I can be stable if I want to do this artist thing, or this entertainment thing, or anything.\u0026rdquo; \u003cbr/\u003eKT: I think with all off that that you all are really creating a family as well. I mean especially with the fact that you all come from different places all over, you all kind of say, \u0026ldquo;Hey, you\u0026rsquo;re dope. We\u0026rsquo;re here for you.\u0026rdquo;\u003cbr/\u003eMG: I mean, yeah, we\u0026rsquo;re definitely working towards that. We\u0026rsquo;re also working towards people saying, \u0026ldquo;Hey I grew with ya\u0026rsquo;ll. I remember ya\u0026rsquo;ll when you weren\u0026rsquo;t big yet,\u0026rdquo; and sharing that with other people. That\u0026rsquo;s why us being involved with ASU (Afrikan Student Union) or campus events, let\u0026rsquo;s people feel like, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, that\u0026rsquo;s our house band. We see them a lot.\u0026rdquo; (laughs) We\u0026rsquo;re trying to make it where Westwood becomes a place for artists and good vibes. Something like Westwood Village is meant for diversity and it\u0026rsquo;s to impact and empower the masses. That\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;ve made songs like \u0026ldquo;We Dem College Kids\u0026rdquo; because at the end of the day we\u0026rsquo;re not just one race, we\u0026rsquo;re the human race. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can find Munir Griffin/Westwood Village\u0026rsquo;s music at \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/munirgriffin\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/munirgriffin\u003c/a\u003e or\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/westwoodvillageent\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://soundcloud.com/westwoodvillageent\u003c/a\u003eCheck their diversity in genre and vibes as you listen.You can reach them on their soundclouds linked above.​\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Genres expanded into the mainstream, lyrical content diversified into a number of new and many previously taboo subject areas, but seemingly most important, the style of popular music was able to abandon the rockabilly and doowop roots that defined the 1950s to adopt more sophisticated arrangements. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne could say that popular music as a whole found a way to become more seriously or scholarly appreciated beyond merely aesthetically pleasing voices and catchy tunes (not that there\u0026rsquo;s ever been anything wrong with that combination). And when people think back on this revolutionary time period of social and stylistic upheaval, the artists they come back to as the instigators are for the most part the same: Bob Dylan, The Beatles, Velvet Underground etc. but there\u0026rsquo;s a vital piece of connective tissue missing in those musical influences. Velvet Underground didn\u0026rsquo;t debut until 64 and freewheelin Bob Dylan was out in ‘63 but from about ‘59 till the release of that album was a time period when the Titans of rockabilly sound had disappeared from the popular eye. Elvis was in the army, Chuck Berry was in jail, Jerry Lee Lewis was socially ostracized after news of his marriage to his 13 year old cousin came out, and little Richard had found Jesus. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn between that time, the forgotten voice, that both those rockabilly superstars and the future legends of the 60s agreed was the best among them, was Roy Orbison. Now I can\u0026rsquo;t necessarily say that Roy Orbison is forgotten, since everyone and their mothers cat knows \u0026ldquo;pretty woman\u0026rdquo;, but that\u0026rsquo;s not even the kind of music that makes him vitally important to the history of rock n roll. And of course, music scholars and writers know him, but his lack of presence in the public narrative of musical legends troubles me so much, I bothered to write this article about it for a blog most people will never see any way. Beginning with the creation of the \u0026ldquo;Nashville sound\u0026rdquo; which I\u0026rsquo;ve discussed previously on my radio show (check us out Thursdays at 11am!), Orbison was able to seize the opportunity with grade A backup musicians and experienced producers to craft a sound around his incredibly powerful voice. His patented style of uniquely structured recording sessions from the top down, beginning with background vocals and ending with string rhythms, was fashioned for the 1960 hit \u0026ldquo;only the lonely\u0026rdquo;, which also showcased his incredible vocal range through the addition of falsetto notes. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthering the strangeness of these sessions, Orbison refused to edit songs together, insisting on a single take with all instruments together for a cohesive sound. This song and style alone shot him to the top of the charts and had him touring with country legend Patsy Cline, while Elvis was buying boxes of Orbison’s records to pass out to friends. From there his style only diversified, with his major hits being notable for all following different structures rather than the standard verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge structure of pop songs. \u0026ldquo;In dreams\u0026rdquo; featured in the lynch masterpiece Blue Velvet, has no repeating structural elements, while \u0026ldquo;running scared\u0026rdquo; from his career defining 1962 album Crying, repeats the same structure until the very end building suspense in tune with the lyrical content of boyfriend worrying about his girl\u0026rsquo;s ex coming back. These structures may not mean much on the page, but to the musicians that had to record them, they were baffling, with some quoted as saying they\u0026rsquo;d question Orbison the first time he directed them on what to play until finally the sound just clicked.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWords By:\u003c/i\u003e David Wright\u003c/p\u003e",

Born in St. Louis under the name of Solána Rowe, SZA entered summertime 2017 in a precarious scenario. In the three plus years since her last official musical release, she had begun to garner comparisons to superstars of the like of Beyonce and Frank Ocean. With the release of \u003ci\u003eCTRL\u003c/i\u003e, SZA finally establishes herself within 2017’s R\u0026amp;B landscape as a force to be reckoned with.\u003cbr/\u003eThe album is a 14 track escape that features lush production and lyrical growth, all backed behind the fearless yet fragile delivery of SZA. The album takes a look at love from her perspective that applies a beauty so raw and real to the lyrics that, as a listener, you wish you could apply to yourself. As the album progresses, her criticisms of modern love and dating become a tug-of-war\u003cbr/\u003ebetween issues that need to be taken seriously and changed versus accepting what is that cannot be changed. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom a musical standpoint, the record takes on a much more modern version of\u003cbr/\u003eR\u0026amp;B. Guitar riffs lay the foundation for a borderline ‘indie-rock’ feel on cuts like “Supermodel,” while other songs like “Go Gina” are driven by repetitive percussion.

As soon as I heard the first few cords of that song, I loved it. The song was so groovy and perfect for a sexy summer day. I ended up finding more of his music on \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/satchelbrown-899733979\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSoundCloud\u003c/a\u003e, where he had a few thousand listens on various songs. Some day in July I was listening to my “Discover Weekly” playlist on Spotify and one of his songs played; I immediately went on his artist page and saw that he had released an album. I saved the album and listened to it in about 30 minutes. For his first ever album, it’s pretty good. It felt as though some songs had more effort put into them than others though. For example, some songs are just filler/transition tunes leading up to a few better songs. So it felt like the album was really just five or six sounds, with some transitions in between. Other songs are just demos of the same songs on the album, which I though was kinda redundant and nothing new. The album sounds as though it was very influenced by current lo-fi-sythy-dream bedroom pop music mixed with some slow jazzy beats and mellow, groovy deep bass riffs. The songs that stand out to me the most on this album are “In Your Sheets,” “Where’s The Sex,” and “Compatibility.” These songs are very well composed and contain all the elements needed to make you feel as though you’re in some dreamy love state parked in a car at 2 a.m. Overall though the album is cohesive – every song is relevant to the next, containing chill beats throughout. This album is a collection of smooth tunes that complement one another and just put you in a super lax mood.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Chip Kelly: Let’s Take a Look at the Hype",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten by Spencer Weissman \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith Chip Kelly recently hired as the head football coach for the UCLA Bruins, let’s take a look about what all the hype about. For those who don’t know his background, he is the former head coach of the Oregon Ducks (2009-2012), Philadelphia Eagles (2013-2015), and San Francisco 49ers (2016). He is known for creating the most unique offense in the modern NFL and NCAAF, in which teams limit their time in between plays, limit the amount of substitutions, minimize time of possession, and utilize the quarterback outside of the pocket. For his system to work, he will have to recruit unique talents that fit his system. His offense will be much different than what UCLA currently has and runs.\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCollege Record: \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn four years as the coach of the Oregon Ducks, Kelly led them to one National Title game, a Fiesta Bowl, and a pair of Rose Bowls. For reference, UCLA has not been in the Rose Bowl since 1999, or any other major bowl game for that matter. In just four years, Kelly was able to take his teams there four times. In 2007, when Kelly became the offensive coordinator of Oregon, he took them from a middle of the pack offense to one of the most elite offensives in the country. His style of play led to a revolution in the college football landscape that led to almost all teams adjusting their style of play to be like him. Overall with Kelly as a head coach, Oregon went 46-7 finishing in the top five of the rankings three of the four years. This guy did everything as a college coach besides winning a national championship. He made Oregon the program of the Pac 10 and made staying up late on the East Coast for football worth it. The most prominent quarterback to come out of his system was Marcus Mariota. Under Kelly, Mariota finished in the Top 10 for the Heisman Trophy and put himself on the radar of every NFL franchise. To say Kelly is a program altering coach is an understatement. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCollege Recruiting:\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009While the head coach of Oregon, Kelly successfully recruited in California. In 2011, Kelly landed multiple marquee players from California in hot beds that used to be dominated by UCLA. To show how good he was at selling players on his system, he was able to land the two best athletes in their class to leave California and go to Oregon. Both of these kids were expected to sign with either UCLA or USC, yet they went to the Ducks under Kelly. One of these kids was De’Anthony Thomas, who quickly became the fastest player in college football during his time in college. He was an electric player who would have changed any program he went to. Even though he was from Los Angeles, he decided to go to the Ducks, which would change the landscape of the Pac 10. So now imagine Kelly being able to navigate his old recruiting grounds for a local school. As head coach, he could realistically sign Top 10 recruiting classes regularly. With our resources, new top-notch facilities, and close proximity to hot beds like the entire city of Los Angeles, Fresno, and Chino Hills, nothing could stop this man. \u003c/p\u003e",

With our panzas full we headed out to see Ginuwine. A few minutes into his set, Ginuwine had entranced us all, and even though I had my eyes on him the whole time, I lost him in the middle of his set. I still heard him singing, so I scanned the crowd only to see people moving away from the stage. Ginuwine was in the pit! Like any logical person would do, I ran towards the crowd and although my dinosaur Android wasn’t able to load my camera fast enough, I was able to TOUCH Ginuwine! Needless to say, I can die happy now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1174\" data-orig-width=\"1600\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6c3a7a6c6c5ee281797d29c7f9c761c0/tumblr_inline_p09ccnafZg1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1174\" data-orig-width=\"1600\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2\u003e2.

However, I danced to a lot more sets than I thought I was. During the Thee Commons set I joined the mosh pit during “Demolicion,” and not the cheesy ones that form at indie concerts, like the real ones. A couple minutes later, while waiting for my friends to get merch, I found myself in La Banda Skalavera’s ska circle skanking. Later, I danced cumbia at the Sonora Dinamita set. Sonora Dinamita even made my friend that doesn’t dance, dance. I was so hyped because I got him to do a vuelta.

I also saw representation of so many identities: Latinx, Mexicanxs, Centro Americanxs, Afro-Latinx, Indígenxs, Mestizxs, papas, mamas, mujeres, hombres, agenrex all conviviendo, dancing, crying, fangirling. Tropicalia’s foundations created a greater connection between the audience and the performers than any typical festival. All the people there brought so much good energy, and that energy was reciprocated by the performers and vice versa. All the performers were wishing they could perform longer, and the yelling from the audience showed that they didn’t want it to end either.

The venue is intimate in both size and interior design, furnished with \u003ci\u003eDownton Abbey\u003c/i\u003e chandeliers along with \u003ci\u003eGame of Thrones\u003c/i\u003e chairs. The crowd seems to be a diverse collection of Los Angeles’ wealthiest hipsters, with the man next to me sporting cuffed designer denim with a pair of dirty Converse sneakers (because, you know, he’s really down to earth.) This surprises me, since Nilüfer Yanya’s soul-inspired rock, though enchanting, is hardly the soundtrack of the trendy mainstream. Before I can contemplate the crowd’s demographic any further, however, the lights dim, the audience members take their final Snapchats, and Nilüfer Yanya makes her way to the front of the stage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYanya exudes humility. Before the show began, the 21 year old artist was the one setting up her own microphone and amp. Her stage is small and austerely decorated, making the atmosphere feel less like a Hollywood concert and more like a school talent show. A single colored spotlight shines on Yanya, but this is her only theatrical embellishment. She has no live band, apart from a saxophonist who, as it turns out, is an old friend from high school. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYanya exudes humility, but not weakness. When she sings, she directs her gaze straight ahead, her fingertips gliding over her electric guitar with minimal effort. Her voice is tranquilly sonorous, and her spare use of instrumentals only accentuates the uniqueness of her vocals. She speaks very little throughout the show — a brief “thank you” to the audience here, an apology for being sick there — but her demeanor is not aloof, merely calm and focused.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSharing a central theme of disappointed love, Yanya’s songs are bitter without being hysterical. She conveys the measured poise of someone reflecting on the past, someone whose heartbreak is sincere but no longer frantic. “Is this the end?” she calls out on “Thanks 4 Nothing,” “I don’t think we can be friends.” On a different track, “Keep On Calling,” she sings, “I’m done feeling for you/Boy, I’m getting bored of your ways.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Yanya waxes lyrics about sorrow, love, and nostalgia, I marvel at how her nearly acapella performance suddenly makes the flashy beat drops and light shows of other artists (ahem, Diplo) seem ostentatiously overwrought. In each song, the occasional guitar and saxophone melody run through like an electric current, lighting up Yanya’s stormy vocals without diluting their powerful delivery. Tonight at Hollywood Forever, Yanya conveys a candid and charged simplicity that is all her own.\u003c/p\u003e",

At times, one could say that she might have been trying too hard to convert an audience that was not exactly looking to pick up a new Spotify favorite, as some songs were unenthusiastically received. Nonetheless, Dagny did manage to pull through with some of her more popular hits, and it’s no surprise that they were all upbeat and great songs to dance (or sway, if that’s your limit) to. While I’ve only heard to several of her songs in passing, her live performance of “Backbeat” was nothing short of incredible, especially as I relisten to the studio version of it now and realize that it was in that theater that I was exposed to the best and most deserving version of it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5472\" data-orig-height=\"3648\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/07e88e03e6aebdd38f4132d4cce64948/tumblr_inline_ozd78vR2aS1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5472\" data-orig-height=\"3648\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven in the tiny section of the stage that was partitioned off by her banner, Dagny grazed each square foot of the stage with her mesmerizing presence and built up the excitement for the night. With the thumping of the bass drums and her ability to give some well-planned variations in her songs, the crowd was driven to pure euphoria, albeit it did take the concert goers some time before they realized that Dagny meant business and was not someone that deserves a passive listening.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3648\" data-orig-width=\"5472\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/adab054e38237c270a7e0b5ca0bbb14a/tumblr_inline_ozd7yrVOar1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3648\" data-orig-width=\"5472\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Dagny finished her last set and stage assistants started preparing for LANY, the crowd began piling in and smoke machines were deployed, setting a hot and hazy atmosphere that amplified LANY’s style of music. If one were to describe “The Dagny Experience” as an ultra-vivid dream with clear progression and bright colors, LANY’s would be one that’s muddled, dreamy and hypnotic. The stage setup was interesting; with nothing but their respective instruments, an upright piano in the middle, and three giant LED screens spread across the back of the stage, Klein had more than enough space for his electrifying, high-energy presence that is hard to not fall in love with, in an obsessive yet platonic kind of way. And yet, even as they went through their setlist, Klein seemed to have endless ways of interacting with the stage equipment: from squatting on the piano chair and shredding a solo on the amplifier, to even running along the back where the presumably fragile LED panels are. Loyal fans would’ve been ecstatic with the screens as they complemented the songs and its lyrics: rose graphics going with “Flowers on the Floor” (and might I add that there were indeed plenty of actual roses on the ground next to him), a 5 a.m. digital clock for “Tampa,”,and bright pink for “pink skies.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"5472\" data-orig-width=\"3648\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/02d509feb67b5689fde0ad26c2fe24cb/tumblr_inline_ozd7z7pO1G1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"5472\" data-orig-width=\"3648\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eLANY was heartfelt, truthful, and exactly how I would’ve pictured them to be based on their emotionally varied compositions. Their vibes were adequately balanced between what you would feel during late night drives at 3 a.m., and feel good tracks at 8 a.m. on a good day. The set list did, however, make me a little confused and left me wanting better from them.  During phases in the night where many already had their heart rates at 120bpm and were ready to jump to beats of the next track, LANY came in with an emotional experience that makes you wonder why you’re still stuck with an absent lover, be it emotionally or physically. While I’m definitely not complaining and admittedly I did have a good cry, it was tough to dance while tears were barely dried from the previous track.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith a genuine expression of gratitude, LANY ended their show with an impressive performance of “ILYSB,” leaving us with the emotions embedded in the same song dedicated to the band itself. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3648\" data-orig-width=\"5472\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2282e8076eda6e90452e6e4e1694ed9a/tumblr_inline_ozd7zr9F8J1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3648\" data-orig-width=\"5472\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

The brick walls were covered in cobwebs and the audience lurked in elaborate costumes ranging from bloody clowns to Street Fighter characters. This is one of my favorite venues - an abandoned Highland Park pool hall transformed into a rustic warehouse, it is the perfect, hole-in-the-wall venue for an intimate gathering of lo-fi and garage music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis time, I came for SadGirl for their Halloween tour kickoff. I find it hard to describe SadGirl’s sound. From LA, they’re a fusion of surf, garage, punk-rock with an all-American nostalgic aura… I can feel myself referencing classic west coast films like Quentin Tarantino and Chinatown or sixties bands like The Ventures in every song.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"733\" data-orig-width=\"489\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/49ded3c4f78adc1144418b51cc8cc859/tumblr_inline_ozc70k1F3a1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"733\" data-orig-width=\"489\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt 11:30 p.m., the stage shone in blue and purple, as Misha Lindes (guitars/vocal) lurked in as a cowboy with bullet holes and blood dripping on his head and neck, along with Dakota Peterson (bass) as a zombie, and Paul Caruso (drummer) in a red devil onesie. They opened the show with “The Hand That Did the Deed,” an instrumental song with a mix of Kill Bill and Dick Dale vibes. The murmuring crowd quickly hushed and was transported into a different era, as SadGirl never fails to do, when Lindes and Peterson began strumming their guitars. After the mellow entrance, they quickly switched pace with “Swine,” and the crowd went ballistic. A mosh pit began in the middle of the floor, with beers flying and toilet paper rolls in the air. Peterson’s bass dictated the heat and the unstoppable force on the dance floor. Lindes looked down and laughed a bit, and returned himself back completely into the performance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI noticed that they consciously alternated between their upbeat, punk songs and their lo-fi, psychedelic tunes, and cleverly inserted their notable instrumental guitar covers in between. After the audience went berserk over “Swine” and “Penelope’s Leg,” they slowed our heart rates with “Little Queenie.” Lindes’ voice is low and rough but the way it transferred out of the mic was effortlessly clean, pure and silky. His body flailed around to the beat and his eyes rolled around to the melody. I could feel the audience collectively becoming hypnotized by the gentle strumming and his husky voice. I did the same and let my head fall back and sway. He also played my personal favorite, “Jack the Ripper,” a cover of an instrumental guitar song by Link Wray \u0026amp; The Wraymen. They dimmed the lights in red so you can barely see their shadow, and I felt like I was being rocked to bed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"697\" data-orig-width=\"1045\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5419ab3f764bdde982800bf556ad8a92/tumblr_inline_ozc712qzSt1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"697\" data-orig-width=\"1045\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey picked up the pace once again with “Born Dumb” and “Take Me Home,” which are their more aggressive rock selections, and ended the show with “Breakfast Is Over” and “Norma \u0026amp; Jessica,” the two crowd favorites. I was looking forward to these songs because I expected the space to silence in the psychedelic atmosphere, but I was surprised to see that the audience began crowd surfing (one person even got on stage) and toilet paper once again began flying around, even hitting the cymbal at one point. As riveting as the scene was, I felt the audience to be disrespectful throughout and it almost ruined the entire experience for me. Nonetheless, SadGirl never fails to transcend multiple vignettes through their music variety and delicate strums and vocals that keep the audience alive and collective the entire night. When the show ended at 12:08 a.m., it felt like only five minutes passed. I wanted more, and surely will return. \u003c/p\u003e",

It’s not just a listening experience, but can make us feel a wide range of emotions and gives us context and validation for our own feelings. That’s why most of my earliest memories revolve around music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe sonora dinamita that crackled through the speakers of parent’s vans as we drove on the 210 to get el mandado.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe smell of fabuloso and sounds of Celso Pina ft. my mom\u0026rsquo;s vocals  at 6 a.m. on Saturday mornings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrying to fix the antenna to watch Ivy Queen’s “Que Lloren” on MTV3 because she had me gagging every time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut as I got older I started to feel disillusioned. I distanced myself from my culture and listened to pura music gavacha, like the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Kings of Leon, No Doubt, and even The Killers (OMG OK, I said it!)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs I got older, I went through a bit of self reflection, and began to listen to my “parents’ music” again. I instantly felt the familiar warmth of nostalgia. But this time I saw myself as a borderland, ni de aqui ni de alla, not being able to be on a side, feeling like a poser on either end. I soon realized, though, that music is borderless, both intangible and present ,and my playlists began to reflect that. Cumbia to rock, bachata to R\u0026amp;B, EDM y reggaeton. I am not a bordertown, I am a crossroad, where cultures meet and live at peace.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is exactly what the Tropicalia line-up embodies. Its diversity fuses genres and cultures and creates a space where all can feel welcome and accepted.

The most dedicated of the liberal, disillusioned mid-20s Los Angeles crowd sold out the Greek Theatre to share the last ironic laugh with Josh Tillman on his “Pure Comedy” tour. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWeyes Blood (singer-songwriter Natalie Mering) started the night with a satisfying but wholly unexciting opening set. Framed by two electric candelabras that may have been stolen out of a haunted house, Mering’s small touring band took up only a fraction of the stage. But it was Mering’s vocals that took the spotlight (and appropriately so), its rich, mellow, and slightly haunting tone only needing the embellishment of a couple piano chords and her acoustic guitar, the other accompanying instruments chiming in. Her lyrics contain enough curiosity, longing, and love to feel like late night ballads. Indeed, wearing what looked like white silk pajamas, strumming her acoustic guitar, it felt like Mering had just gotten out of bed and walked on stage to play sweet songs into a sleepless night. As she sang Mering’s eyes gazed out to a faraway place, reminding us she belongs to some other world, whether it’s to the audience’s sympathy or chagrin. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile Mering gave a beautiful performance, its low, steady energy didn’t feel appropriate as an opening set. My friend put it a little more bluntly: “I’m bored.” I did feel slightly sedated, Mering’s voice echoing slightly in my ears, as I waited for the headliner. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter a strange period of psychedelic instrumental tracks between sets that could’ve just been Tillman’s personal meditation playlist, the headlining performance began. On the back screen of the stage played demented amateur cartoons that looked like they were lifted from the journal of a sociopathic child (the same creepy characters that decorate the \u003ca href=\"https://www.fatherjohnmisty.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e for Tillman’s new album). Finally Tillman took the stage, his face cast in perfect halves of yellow and blue light, the golden bad, kinda sad boy of folk rock, purveying the crowd for a moment before launching into “Pure Comedy.”  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike the modest cast of Weyes Blood, Tillman filled the stage and his sound with a substantial brass and string accompaniment. The backing flowed with his hopping between folk, rock, and country with an ease even Tillman acknowledged with appreciation towards the end of the night. The variety of songs provided snapshots of the many moods of Tillman, from him strolling across stage declaring war against cell phones and prescription drugs, to his sweet, bumbling comments between songs, to a daring throw of a guitar to a stagehand in a seemingly endless series of instrumental changes. And then there was the dancing. Tillman exhibited sashays, hip thrusts and backwards dips in a style so ungainly yet confident it reminded you that Tillman is a very strange man, who must have quite a bit of sex. His performance was not a centimeter less than the full nine yards, a two hour set with a multiple song encore. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s hard to tell how Tillman expresses believing in both everything and nothing. His unrhyming, unadorned lyrics take on the height of American disillusionment in “Bored in the USA,” while he woos adoring listeners with the sweet possibility of “Real Love Baby.” The enthusiasm of the crowd, who stayed out of their seats for the majority of the show, a pair of young men even thrusting their fists into the air with shouts of admiration, proved however he does it, he pulls it off pretty damn well. \u003c/p\u003e",

It’s a scene that in large part is spearheaded by independent, often extremely young individuals with a passion for making music accessible to everyone. Although not an expert, I often find that financial and logistical means limit music accessibility more and more every day. I believe that music and its presentation as a commodity modifies its artistic expression for the worse, and that’s why Minty Boi Presents DIY shows in the Los Angeles area are so special. You see not only that Yi Wei (奕维), the man behind the action, is a purveyor of artistic expression, but also that he cares about making music accessible to everyone.\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was fortunate enough to talk with Yi Wei when he guest DJ’d for us on UCLA Radio, and gave away some tickets to his show on July 15. With Current Joys headlining and a rad set including none other than T-Rextasy, Ian Sweet, Hardly Boys, Goose Pimple, and Rumblepak, I was stoked. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFollowing a visit to the 7-Eleven across the street, me and two friends step into the freight elevator and ascend into Minty Boi’s Factory, a DIY venue in DTLA.  I’m met at the door with a hug from none other than Yi Wei, the Minty Boi himself. Unsure of what to expect other than a lot of black skinny jeans, I find a group of people present for the music, to hear the bands that they love, and in an intimate setting to do so. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy first assessment of the room leaves me lost; maybe because I pictured a warehouse full of laborers, or maybe because the situation is so new to me. Maybe I’m just unsure. I look at the faces around me, I take a deep breath in of cigarette smoke.  The room smells strongly of weed and Goodwill, but it’s not bad. In fact, it is a community of Los Angeles friends who have been a part of the DIY scene forever. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe fluorescent, pink and blue dim combined with the echo of the amber lights lining the street below relaxes me. The paint on the walls is chipping, tin-foil as a repair agent, black paint. The LA skyline is romantically explained through the drone of the guitar and the large windows. The music was complementing the location for a change. The music was complementing everything and everyone. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSurrounded by tiny backpacks, round, gold-rimmed glasses, and leather jackets, “I was happy, weirds me out dude.” In a sea of music and beautiful people, I danced. We danced. It was refreshing to feel a part of something; to feel even the slightest bit of a collective. My night peaked when a glowing, shirtless boy with the mane of a competition horse dove past me into the flow of the crowd. It took me longer than my pals to realize that man was Yi Wei. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFollow \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/minty_boi/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@Minty_Boi\u003c/a\u003e on Instagram and \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/mintyboishows\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@MintyBoiShows\u003c/a\u003e on Twitter for updates on upcoming shows!\u003c/p\u003e",

This is our first time playing with The Regrettes, who are all only 15 or 16. It’s great that we can be a part of this with them. One of the band members Dad’s messaged me on Facebook and we were discussing the tour. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDjBree: Did you have a mentor when you first started?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBREE: Not even taking people under your wing but just being like, a nice peer. When you’re in music in Seattle, you’re in a Seattle DIY atmosphere… they make you feel that ‘you can do this too.’ I like having a community with these ladies… anything related to art, like music or radio, it feels good. For my own experience, it felt really intimidating being a fem playing music, so it feels good to have a non-binary, feminist audience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJBree: Do you think you expanded your fan base just on the virtue of being feminist?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBREE:I think it expanded because its been male dominated for most of my life, so having songs and topics that we can relate to… Like, we just started writing songs about our songs and our experiences and that’s feminist centric because its our values. I think when we get fans that feel the same way where they haven’t been touched on as much, it feels cool that they end up liking our music because they end up being similar as us. You end up really loving your fans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJBree: You just reminded me of your song, “Crimson Wave”, where you write about being on your period. This topic is kind of a unicorn because we know it exists but no one wants to talk about it, but you unleash this stigma to make it a natural, funny thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBREE: YEAH! Half the population goes through this every month or has to deal with it. Its like.. what? How has this not been talked about? Its such a big deal. Theres 3 ladies in the band and we talk about it pretty comfortably. Why do we have to hide it? Its so stupid. If men went through this, there would be so many songs about it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJBree:  Talking about your tour, do you have any embarrassing moments that have happened when you performed?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBREE: Oh yeah, all the time. We have many embarrassing stories that have happened over the years… But 2 days ago in Portland we got stuck in traffic and we were playing at a record store, and we were late. We missed load in, so we had to be super sweaty and gross in front of this crowd of people and unload and immediately perform. It was a lot of work, but we pulled it off.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDjBree: Im sure you have all your own habits and quirks about you. What’s a quirk that you have that may bother other people on the road? Do you make smoothies at 5 am?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eBREE: We’re just 4 people that live in a van for months and months, so eventually the smallest thing will get to us.. like, how I chew my food really loud, or crazy things like that. Normally we’re pretty laid back people, but there are things that start to get to people. We have a funny relationship where we know our routines are understood, like we know Eric needs to pee before bed or Emily needs a certain kind of tea, we all know to take care of each other. There’s habits that are just unspoken. I know these people better than I know anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDjBree: So to talk about your writing process, when you go to write a song or coming up with a concept, is there ever a clash when you develop them or is it go with the flow?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBREE: Its usually go with the flow. It starts with me and Erick who comes up with rifts ourselves and we try to mesh it together with Lila. Sometimes its hard to change things that someone wrote, but we can navigate it. We come up with song topics based on what we’re talking about. Emily is the master of melody and weaves it together, like the last piece of the puzzle. Its really fun.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDjBree: No fist fights over the process?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBREE: Not yet! Maybe today! The thing about it, is we’re all libras, so it takes a while.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDjBree: Oh really! Do you buy in to astrology? Do you check your moons? You must have a really fun birthday.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBREE: Oh yeah, we’re way in to being libras. Actually, our drummer is the only non libra, so she complains about October being the break the bank month where she spends all her money going out with us.. we’re just like, sorry Lila.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDjBree: Any plans for this October?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBREE: we were talking about going to mexico because we would have just gotten from tour, but we might just want to stay home and veg out. I just finished Jane the Virgin, Game of Thrones, and I rewatched Sex and the City.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDjBree: Okay, then the question becomes- are you team BIG, or team AYDEN?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBREE: I keep getting in to this fight, this is so funny. I think Ayden is a good guy! (laughs) He’s like such a good person, but my friend Julia from “Chastity Belt is” very team Big and says Ayden is a clingy monster.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDjBree: It’s funny how the human mind works- we always want what we can’t have. In terms of your latest album, “Lost Time.” How did this album come to fruition?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBREE: It came from songs we wanted to do… the “leisure bee concept” vs “worker bees.” We’re sort of in an alternate lifestyle. For the most part we wrote all of them in a 2 month period. We had gotten back from a tour had had the whole summer to write.. We had never worked with a producer up until this point, but everything that he had technically speaking- how we should record drums, double vocals, is really awesome. Sometimes when you play the same song over and over, you get stuck in your own head.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJBree: Any songs you love playing?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBREE: weekend and internet, which are about internet trolls. Its just like a fun, dancy song vibe. So its just fun to play too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJBree: While on tour, what are 3 things you wish you could bring on the road?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBREE: I miss vegging out and ordering Indian food in my pjs all day on Netflix, which is a big one… the person we’re dating, which is a hard one. We try to hangout every 3 weeks for a few days which is really important to us. I’ve gone through this a lot, and it seems like a good solution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJBree: This might be a basic question, but our audience needs to know, how did you come up with the name, TacoCat?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBREE: Me and my friend scotty were just writing out a bunch of palindromes, like, racecar, and we were playing around with them on a napkin at his work.. And TacoCat came up, we said it would be a good girl’s band. And here we are.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDjBree: You consider your genre to be feminist sci fi.. Can you explain with this means?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBREE: Did you come across the drawing of the cat with the antennas? There was this short-lived book club in Seattle and the genre came up… it was so appealing to me. So much sci fi has a feminist slant, but I never considered it as a drama. We have some songs like “alien girl” and it’s just fun to think of music through this lens.  There are so many intersections of feminism, and that’s important to us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDjBree: Feminism has been given a bad rep lately because people think feminists just want to destroy all men and burn beards. Why is this happening?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBREE: its such a weird flashback. Theres such a weird reaction to it. We enjoy pants and the right to vote, and to walk around without being scared of rape.. There are so many important benefits that you would have to be crazy to be against it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDjBree: your thoughts on menninism?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBREE: it’s a really pathetic flashback against feminism. I went to this standup comic, and I had never heard the term before, and he asked if there are any menninists in the room. It was me and my 6 friends in the front row and gave him a “WTF” look, and he kind of dropped it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDjBree: Do you have an album that you would embarrassed for your friends to find?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBREE: I think since we’re in a band all the time, my friends know everything about me already.. but Blind Melon and Eve 6, any 90’s one hit wonders are still good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDjBree: if you were to get arrested, what would it  be for?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBree: probably drinking in public.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJBree: Youre going to on tour July 19 at the Echo. Is there anything you want to tell our listeners?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBree: this show is going to be super fun, I’m looking forward to it! Unfortunately the bar I usually go to after the show, smogcutter, is shut down.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDjBree: Thanks so much for talking with me today, UCLA Radio is happy to have you on. We’ll see you at the Echo!\u003c/p\u003e",

We were gearing up for a Frankie Cosmos show.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUpon leaving the\nunderground world of business workers coming home for supper, for the above, we\nspotted a girl - 5'11\u0026rsquo; in all denim, with sheer, slightly ripped tights,\nslowly meandering out of the metro tunnel. I immediately knew we could just\nfollow this California aesthetic manifesto instead of pulling out Google Maps\nto make our way to the venue. (Always knew indie music was homey.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs my roommate and I\nfollowed \u003ci\u003edenim\u003c/i\u003e, we walked towards a\nshitty burgers and fries joint, with hipsters all wearing pants cut 2.5 inches\ntoo short for their ankles and large, circular glasses. In the backroom\nwas the venue: \u003ci\u003eL’Espace B.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe line to enter was next\nto the restroom as a boy with electric white hair in all leather motioned to\nstamp our wrists.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInside, everyone was light.\nAnd ready for Frankie Cosmos and her bellowing presence. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe opener was an unknown indie\nkiss pop / surf pop band, who I\u0026rsquo;m sure we\u0026rsquo;ll all be coming to see in a few\nmonths. The lead awkwardly danced around a street level stage, in her Bobbie haircut\nand Hawaiian shirt.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn front of the eagle\nwinged background, \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/aries-sun-music/reposts\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAries Sun\u003c/a\u003e fledged\nabout, speaking mostly French which was nice for an audience who was a few\nbeers in, in preparation to only hear Frankie\u0026rsquo;s American accents. She calmly\ndrank wine and joked about Frankie. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGreta Kline, or better\nrecalled as Frankie Cosmos, finally came out with a snapback and her 5'2\u0026quot;\nself stood a little too small for the mic stand. Frankie gripped her guitar letting\neveryone know she was here to rock. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe opened, \u0026ldquo;Je ne\nparle pas et je ne comprends pas.” Everyone laughed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis was Frankie’s first\nshow of their first tour in Europe. Frankie basically said if you don\u0026rsquo;t\nunderstand English - fuck it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEveryone pretty much\nrespected that. \u003c/p\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cp\u003eThroughout the show Frankie\nwould say something in English, \u0026quot;Now I\u0026rsquo;m going to play songs from my new\nalbum, and after I\u0026rsquo;ll play old songs,” then passing the mic to her drummer who\nwould (loosely) translate every word. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot that the audience\nreally cared, singing along all the vowels with her, as they barely understood,\nbut wanted so hard to mimic the soft, melodic sound in the air. I guess that\u0026rsquo;s all\nthat really matters anyways. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is to say, Frankie\nherself isn\u0026rsquo;t an amazing singer, just really real (and makes very mosh-able\nmusic for a 2016 world). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAmidst shockingly good\nsound quality (for a small venue in the back of a mini bar diner shack), the\nshow really fared well. Lots of head bobbing and the music perfectly\nmatched what you would hear on a Frankie Cosmos vinyl.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEveryone welcomed them, not\nas 4 “Burgerkids” Americans, but as 4 sun kissed Californians, under shitty yellow\nstage lights, came to really put on a show that a foreign audience would\nenjoying jamming to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026quot;I have a bilingual\njoke,\u0026rdquo; Frankie began. \u0026ldquo;In America, we eat two eggs for breakfast, but\nin France, one is enough\u0026rdquo; - a play on words on \u003ci\u003eun œuf\u003c/i\u003e – the French word for egg.

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By\u003c/i\u003e : Dylan Karlsson, UCLA Radio Digital Press\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date\u003c/i\u003e : 06/03/16\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"5230\" data-orig-width=\"7000\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/58e2406526fa9225068f7288653cc556/tumblr_inline_o87k2z0lKm1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"5230\" data-orig-width=\"7000\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eYorgos Lanthimos’ The Lobster is an unsettling and perplexing look at romance and the unquestioned structures of authority constrict our social relations. In his latest, the Greek film-maker transitions from the anxious and claustrophobic settings of Dogtooth (2009) and Alps (2012) to the sprawling and bleak Irish scenery, lending to The Lobster’s dystopic mood. In the movie, David, a newly-divorced architect (played by Colin Farell), arrives at a hotel where he has 45 days to find a new lover. In the case that he does not succeed, David, as all guests who fail to court a partner, is to be turned into an animal of his choosing – he picks a lobster because of its longevity and fertility. Bereft of reason, the hotel is tinged with alienating power dynamics: single guests at the hotel are treated as subordinates to couples, and compatibility is reduced to a “defining characteristic” shared by two people.\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe hotel’s insular nature is disturbed once we are introduced to the Loners, abject dissidents who live in the woods, without partners. These rebels are hunted down by hotel inhabitants in exchange for extra days at the hotel, turning the natural process of love into a question of survival. The film is bifurcated as David soon joins this band of Loners. Here he encounters the Loner Leader (Léa Seydoux) and a Nearsighted Woman (Rachel Weisz), with whom he shares this characteristic. Though this faction strives to undermine the hotel’s way of life, the Loner Leader enforces her own laws to prevent the formation of relationships (including mutilation and the secluding effect of electronic music). In this gradual, yet startling realization we find that perhaps no relationship and no community is formed organically, but only within the bounds of these strict social norms, which to us seem all but normal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe world of The Lobster is rife with allegorical connections to the world we inhabit. It’s absurdity reflects upon the anxiety of modern-day relationships, in the ambiguous and interpretive way Kafka treated isolation under a growing totalitarian state, or as Buñuel treated the complacency of the bourgeoisie. The film first alienates: with consciously non-emotive performances, jarring scenes of violence and mutilation, and musical accompaniments, which further mystify the film’s tone. But beyond this initial alienating effect, the film resonates. Absurd moments strike horror just as easily as they incite laughter, and tenderness comes in the form of coded gestures, far removed from the direct affection we comprehend. There are informational holes that leave me questioning the schematics of their society long after my first viewing, and performances that expose the fabrication and implausibility of these characters. In questioning the dictums of this world, Lanthimos succeeds in creating pause for us to reflect on what affects our capacity and ability to form relationships. \u003c/p\u003e",

Servito’s sound speaks to his roots in Detroit, the city responsible for giving birth to techno. Servito’s rise to prominence is delineated by his status as a Ghostly International DJ, position as a resident at The Bunker New York, and recent ranking on Resident Advisor’s annual taste-making DJ Poll, among other things. It would be uncouth to mention Servito without taking into consideration his contributions to the queer dance community. Recently featured in NPR’s article \u003ca href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2016/04/12/473817426/reclaiming-the-queer-dance-floor\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eReclaiming the Queer Dance Floor\u003c/a\u003e, Servito has been hailed as a central figure in today’s queer dance music realm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen techno legend Robert Hood came up to bat, the energy of the room shifted. The commencement of his set commanded a sense of reverence, as he opened with the minimal techno he is known for pioneering. The Detroit native’s contributions to electronic music have been enormous, including co-founding the massively influential label Underground Resistance and independently creating labels such as M-Plant and Hard Wax. With a career spanning over three decades, Hood’s longevity can be chalked up to his drive to create timeless music and dogmatic dedication to polishing his sound, rolling with the technological changes in the industry while not succeeding to them. Hood’s masterful mixing on Saturday night was made all the more impressive given the fact that he played almost exclusively from vinyl. A self-identified Christian, Hood brings an interesting perspective to dance music, which can get a rather hedonistic rap. That said, the way his music spiritually invigorated the dance floor left even the worst sinners with a sense of divine rebirth.\u003c/p\u003e",

Not only is she a female DJ succeeding in a male-dominant male music scene, but she has collaborated with huge names such as Anderson .Paak, Gavin Turek and Jonny Pierce from the Drums. She is a Do-Lab veteran, and a definite good time. \u003ci\u003eShe’s on at 11pm at the Thunder Stage. \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUCLA’s very own CEC and Message in a Melody will be having \u003cb\u003eAutograf \u003c/b\u003eperform a live set tomorrow night in Ackerman!

He plays music from all genres to create a surreal dancing experience. \u003ci\u003eHe’s on at 4:15pm at the Thunder Stage. \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eParisian musical duo \u003cb\u003eIbeyi\u003c/b\u003e is another incredible act you shouldn’t miss.

Last year they opened for Anna Lunoe for Message in a Melody’s annual concert and they killed it. Justin Jay\u0026rsquo;s set is one of the most interactive I’ve ever been to. They’re upbeat and fun and sure to leave you in a good mood. \u003ci\u003eThey’re on pretty early at 1:30pm at the Thunder Stage. \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eFor your consideration: \u003c/b\u003eHayden James, Lucent Dossier Experience, Haywire.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eSUNDAY:\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat bittersweet feeling of the Sunday of a music festival will probably hit you here. Make sure to live it up as much as possible before you’re back to reality!

There is no doubt in my mind that his set will be the most lit of the weekend. His live sets stand alone as some of the most expert DJing at the moment. He blends countless genres to create a futuristic and trapped out experience. This will be an extremely packed crowd, so try and get there early! \u003ci\u003eHe’s on at 11pm at the Thunder Stage. \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you missed\u003cb\u003e Four Te\u003c/b\u003et at the Shrine a few weeks ago, now is the time to make up for that FOMO. Having dropped his incredible new album Morning/Evening (if you haven’t heard it yet - check it out), Four Tet will brings a unique sound to traditional dance music by incorporating organic and programmed sounds. \u003ci\u003eDon’t miss his set at The Woogie Stage at 10pm!\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI actually first heard about the \u003cb\u003eDesert Dwellers Live Experience\u003c/b\u003e from an Uber drive on my way to an LED Presents rave during Memorial Day last year. If you’re looking for that “Burning Man” aspect that so many say LIB fosters, this is a set you will want to check out. \u003ci\u003eThey’re on at 6:25pm at the Thunder Stage. \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eChet Faker\u003c/b\u003e is an obvious addition to this list. Many don’t actually know that he is quite the musician and will blow your mind with his incredible vocals. He’s not too bad to look at either. If you want to end the night singing along to his countless hits, \u003ci\u003ehe’s closing the Lightning Stage at 12:30am. \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMake sure to catch rising star, \u003cb\u003eLafa Taylor\u003c/b\u003e, at the Lightning Stage at 2:20pm on Sunday.

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By \u003c/i\u003e: Max Nath, UCLA Radio Digital Press\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date\u003c/i\u003e : 05/22/16\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009For my air-check last quarter, I desperately searched for music to stream for NMF’s. I had, obviously erroneously, convinced myself that it would be a near-impossible endeavor to find any new music that could even remotely embody the bold, experimental classic (mainly focusing in progressive) rock sound that I have come to treasure. So, to set out in my search, I simply googled the phrase “new prog rock”. I sifted and clicked, scrolled and refined — and eventually, I came upon a new English group called Messenger, that had recently pre-released a song titled Balearic Blue, from their then-upcoming album “Threnodies”.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009I was relieved, entranced and at peace. Coming from a music lover whose appreciation of music stems from lying down and listening to Wishbone Ash for hours, I was ecstatic. The long intro. The feeling of countless intricate components coming together to form a boldly beautiful whole product. The spikes in passion and tempo that fade away into whining guitar solos and tranquil bass riffs. The lead singer’s droning — for lack of a better, more technically and lexically positive description — voice. All of these components reminded me of the music that made me fall in love with, well, music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009And then came the next pre-released song, “Calyx”. And then came the disappointment. What I had expected to be another piece of infectiously interesting old-style progressive rock, was instead a boring, run-of-the mill ambient experimentation that loses itself in a desperate attempt to capture a tone of intensity. The elements of the song feel disconnected and disinteresting, and the band seems to focus their energy on building a cheap, movie-trailer style of escalation instead of creating a cohesive and fluid piece. It is rushed, loud, excited — but pointless and random. I felt disillusioned and cheated — my cynical bitterness had been verified.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009And then came the album. I went with a “pin the tail on the donkey” style of picking which song I would take the chance in wasting my time on, fearing further disappointment. So I closed my eyes and clicked. On came the song Celestial Spheres. Then, of course, I smiled. And then came the salvation and the redemption.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009I could hear the bass and an intentional, inspired groove. An intro that set the tone to tap along too, as ambient background guitar and David Byron-esque vocals set the stage for an explosion of harmonies and melodies that stay true to the original rhythm the listener is initially promised with the onset of the bass. The song tells a story, evolving and ever-changing. The bass is consistent and strong, while the guitars and perfectly unintelligible lyrics combine to spin a tale of majesty. And then — out of nowhere — comes a change in the song with a transition of seemingly spontaneous 3 seconds of jazz-style scatting. The bass increases in strength, and the group effectively employs a frequently overlooked key component: silence. Before the song bursts into its final phase of instrumental passion, the escalation is marked by sudden pauses. Each of these pauses is ended abruptly by an exponentially louder (appropriately so) rush of emotion. The inspired vocals, the powerful bass, the guitars that complement each other so well, and the keyboard that ambitiously lays an intricate layer on top of it all, all combine to the buildup we have all been waiting for. And then the song fades into a calmer, bass-heavy ending, and culminates in a satisfying abruptness that shifts even more attention to the journey Messenger has taken us on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009What I see in this album is the start of something great. Although some of the songs on the album come across as uninspired and uninteresting, they are redeemed by their attempt to capture the essence of the fun, snappy and lengthy tracks that set the original groups that founded the progressive psychedelic genre apart from the rest. Messenger capture a sound and style of music that has been missing for quite some time. And when I experience songs like Celestial Spheres, I find it exceptionally difficult to ignore the massive potential that they have moving forward — the potential to make some kick-ass music.\u003c/p\u003e",

Already this year’s hype around Coachella and SXSW has us wishing we joined the party in Indio and Austin. Yet the more you look into it, the more you see these shows come at a price - literally. The reality of festivals these days is that if you want to attend, you have to spend. Tickets alone can be upwards of $300, and the added costs of transportation, lodging, and food means the closest most of us get to any of it is the flower crown filter on Snapchat. As much as we’d like to go insane at Bonnaroo or FYF or EDC, the emptiness of our wallets reflect the emptiness of our hearts - that is, until now. In light of the ridiculous cost of mainstream music festivals, I made it my mission to seek out shows across California broke college students would be able to attend. Here are five summer music festivals you can actually afford:\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePhono del Sol Music Festival\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhere?

The festival is set to feature Chairlift and Alvvays as headliners, along with SF locals The She’s, Hot Flash Heat Wave, and more. Tickets start at just $40.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn The Red Records 25th Anniversary \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhere? The Echo/Echoplex\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen?

Past years have been full of fantastic queer musicians like Mary Lambert and Ruby Rose, and while this year’s full lineup has not been released, Kesha is confirmed to headline. Tickets start at $15, and since it’s a non-for-profit event, all money will go to helping the LGBTQ community. In the past the festival has raised as much as two million dollars in charity (!!!).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlice’s Summerthing\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhere?

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By\u003c/i\u003e : Anastasia Gershman , UCLA Radio Digital Press\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date\u003c/i\u003e : 05/11/16\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is something to be said about a director who can make a movie about baseball players that doesn’t show us any baseball for the first 80 minutes of the film, and who then gives us 3 minutes of baseball before turning the camera away.  If that director is Richard Linklater, said film may also stand as one of the sweetest and interesting homages to baseball; college life; the 80’s; and male camaraderie that’s rolled around in a long time.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEverybody Wants Some!! (2016 dir. Richard Linklater) posits an immensely like-able protagonist in Jake, a freshman baseball player for a Texas university rolling into town on the Thursday prior to the start of classes on Monday.  Ensconced in a rundown house designated for the team and instantly surrounded by the rituals, rites of passage and general antics-about-town of the only sports team on campus that actually wins any games; Jake navigates the weekend with a sense of grace that while understated, is immensely refreshing in contrast to a lot of contemporary narrative heroes.  Jake is young athlete, a kid new to college, and an intelligent and reasonable guy.  He manages to be all of these things without saccharin behavior or any sense of “jumping the shark”.  His ability to roll with the weekend and the team while ferreting out the spaces in his environment where he needs to be an individual form the basis of a gentle, engaging, and ultimately powerful story about what happens when life is right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs much as the film is Jake’s story, the team itself is the star.  The film feels personal.  A house filled with hyper-competitive young men who compete at everything from ping-pong to bong rips looks different from the inside.  Linklater infuses these scenes with a sense of immediacy and a lived-in experience.  Almost every scene involving the young men who Jake lives with feels genuine, as if we are wandering through the memories of a man who remembers this time of his life with fondness and frankness.  These players compete at any and every game they can possibly devise including the most brutal game of knuckle-flicking ever to make the silver screen – yet manage to band together in their pursuit of every girl on campus in a way that would make any coach proud.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJake’s teammates run the gamut from professional college students in their sixth year; to blowhard braggarts with anger issues; to a knock ‘em dead ringer destined for the pros.  Their differences give detail and texture to the unified front that they present to the world and also within the group.  “I can’t believe I’m fighting for this guy” opines a player after their resident hothead gets them thrown out of a bar, and yet he does without question.  When the dressing down of an out-of-line teammate happens on the field through a little mid-game humiliation, his choked-out apology “That was a good hit” shifts his role from bigmouth to bruised compatriot, and with that all is forgiven.  These guys compete at everything; self-police; run their own practices; and do what it takes to get along.  It’s an astute and insightful look into athletic life and team politics when the members of the group are determined to be successful and functioning (for the most part) at a sane and reasonable level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSet in late summer of 1980, the boys navigate a world before cellphones, HIV and college debt.  When Jake falls for a pretty freshman, he goes to her door and tapes a handwritten note.  It’s a device that takes us back to the time when pursuit of a girl meant actually going to where the girl was, and even to young eyes that might not remember these days, the moment rings beautifully true.  When she calls, we share in his elation and go for the ride right along with him.  The same can be said of the rest of the story.   Everybody Wants Some!! is a graceful film that brims with nostalgia without becoming syrupy or treacle.  Instead, it’s a moment to wander in memories that you wish were your own. The best film I’ve seen so far this year. Check it out. \u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Kevin Morby : Singing Saw // Album Review",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By\u003c/i\u003e : Andy Talajkowski, UCLA Radio DJ\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date \u003c/i\u003e: 05/05/16\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009I had the pleasure of seeing Kevin Morby perform live the day after the release of his newest solo album, Singing Saw. I showed up with relatively little knowledge of his music, a gamble that soon paid off - I immediately listened to the entirety of Singing Saw upon returning home from the show, and without doubt found it to be my favorite album of 2016 so far. Morby, while maintaining an overall rock feel, incorporates strong influences from country, folk, and blues, creating a deep yet gentle sound. The feel of the album shifts and evolves - the upbeat “I Have Been to the Mountain” integrates brass instruments with a funkier bass line, while “Singing Saw” evokes mystery with haunting backing vocals, and “Destroyer” juxtaposes a breezy, carefree sound with eerie lyrics of a love long gone. Overall the rich, simple sound immerses you in feeling of calm introspection. Singing Saw evokes many emotions - wonder, contentment, nostalgia, sorrow - but doesn’t force you to confront them, choosing instead to allow you to reflect and appreciate. The music also provokes strong imagery of nature - the lyrics use wilderness metaphors galore to explore deeper themes of religion, life, and love. The music feels as if it’s being played to you like a tale being told beside a soft, crackling campfire in the woods. As the storyteller, Morby intrigues you with his strong, bittersweet vocals that make your heart ache, and makes himself sound like a man much beyond his mere 28 years. Overall Singing Saw awakens a quiet and honest beauty within itself that makes it so damn good. I recommend it to any fans of Kurt Vile and the like or Morby’s other projects (he is also part of The Babies and Woods), along with anyone who’d rather be reminiscing in a log cabin instead of procrastinating on midterms. \u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By\u003c/i\u003e : Harold Gonzalez, UCLA Radio DJ\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date \u003c/i\u003e: 05/03/16\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1200\" data-orig-width=\"1200\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4399848aa22dd6daba7092af25d532b2/tumblr_inline_o6m2b1ersr1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1200\" data-orig-width=\"1200\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eVIEWS was meant to be Drake’s Magnum Opus. All the previous works leading up to this album implied that the Canadian rapper had evolved into a confident, vicious and quite frankly immaculate figure in pop culture. Fresh off the hot streak that was the success of his “mixtape”, If You’re Reading This, It’s Too Late, and a lukewarm yet extremely quotable What a Time to Be Alive, Drake was setting the scene for an album that would change every single nonbeliever’s opinion that he was indeed becoming the pop culture tyrant nobody could touch. He was no longer wallowing in empty feelings brought on by his past-relationships, he was no longer desperate to prove his worth to other critiques, and he felt secured in his own holy city. So when the album’s title gave the impression that Drake would piece together a love-letter to his home fueled by the fire of having reached the peak of his career, many sat back and anxiously waited for the awe-inspiring arrival of the 6god.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany are still waiting, myself included.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe opener to this hour-and-a-half journey is built around sincere feelings of lost friendships and dead intimacy. Drake’s passionately sung vocals are glossy and vibrant; they sit on top of what sounds like the most grandiose and expensive orchestral arrangement that hip hop has seen in the past decade. This façade of beauty and elegance acts as an intriguing doorstep to Drake’s soul-in-audio. If one pays close attention, however, we can find missteps in lyrical direction right from these beginning moments, such as “Ever since you met me / Like when Chrysler made that one car that looked just like the Bentley”. The number of offenses increases as the cuts on the record quickly run by. References to Happy Meals, keychains going “jang-a-lang”, “LOLOL”, being “green like Earth Day” , keeping it “100 like a fever”, and other blatantly cheap, amateurish punchlines take away from any kind of honest and solemn tones that run through extremely sparsely produced tracks. It is as if Drake forgot how to piece together a cohesive and interesting thought without wanting to be cheeky. At the same time, the VIEWS themselves are not really relating at all to the city as much as they are VIEWS into a rearview mirror. Drake has not completely forgiven many instances where he was either betrayed or set aside and he is painfully bitter on many tracks (most notably “Child’s Play”). The 6god has resorted once again to attempting to reconcile with individual women instead of glancing forward to the future. VIEWS, lyrically, on various occasions resembles more like a hastily, handwritten note directed at individuals from his past than the boundary-pushing ode to his efforts to reach success and his city that many desired. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd it’s not like Drake is not capable. “Weston Road Flows” is a great example of a track that invites his listener to walk alongside him, a humble messiah-like figure that delivers flawless flows riddled with details and scenes of his youth. The production on this track is sweetly enveloping, with a honeysuckle sample of Mary J. Blige’s “Mary’s Joint” hanging behind his vocal mix. As his disciples listened onward, they prayed he would deliver more infectious picks like this one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDeliver is a strong term for the next three batch of tracks that listeners are introduced to. “Redemption”, “With You” and “Faithful” are rich with filler. They are beautifully produced, yet not the standouts of production that other tracks like “Feel No Ways” are. They touch on unnecessary topics from the chick who finessed Drake out of money for using a voicemail without permission (“Redemption”) to cliché remarks on being a secondary priority in a relationship where the listener can plug their own names into the Mad-Libs and feel special (“Faithful”). These songs aren’t horrible, but they’re extremely forgettable. There could be a slight saving grace on “With You” but as of listening to this over and over for the past three days, the lack of lyrical depth makes me only question whether or not Drake needs help when writing. The credits don’t list many writers, and where I usually find it admirable to be genuine and not use any ghostwriters, the 6god could have had a saint or two help him out with his depth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDrake is his most influential when he oozes with confidence and self-respect. A god has no reason to wallow over petty missteps, especially those which happened long before the power and success was granted. “Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah, 6 point star, lion of the Judah”: THIS 6god was missing a lot on this record. The 6god that demands attention and acknowledges his affluence over many while still remaining humble to the people and city that placed him where he is currently was desperately needed on many bits of this record. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNope. Instead his followers receive, along with the aforementioned cascade of filler, three blatant attempts to reach a #1 on Billboard by piggybacking on the, quickly being exhausted, Dancehall style. It’s not to say that these tracks, “Controlla”, “One Dance”, and “Too Good”, are not audibly pleasing or festive. They will be frequent go to’s for this summer’s gatherings. However, the 6god pretending to be a Caribbean diety is distasteful for an album that is meant to be a culminating project. This is a relatively recent trend that the Canadian has milked and extorted without any remorse on VIEWS. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe title track is another great reminder of how Drake could have decided to handle his apparent Magnum Opus. “Views” opens with the ferocious flow that can only be attributed to a drive for more success. It is an anthem for his followers, for the OVO label, for the people of Toronto to nod their heads to as they visualize the snow falling once again in the middle of a heat wave. These kinds of tracks are extremely reminiscent of vintage mixtape Drake, and that’s not a bad move at all. Inspired by movements of his city, “Views” has a couple lyrical jewels that address haters and genuine friends’ loyalty to the man. It makes me acknowledge that despite these shortcomings, Drake managed to piece together an album that is just a conglomerate of all his past styles, just unfortunately too heavily focused on petty relationship issues. Drake proved he could be a big boy on IYRTITL and a return to the days of Nothing Was the Same just feels extremely out of place on this album. The imagery, the tone, the sentiments that are delivered by the artwork on this record do not match those that are vocally expressed. In terms of production, the team behind Drake should really be getting a large cut from all the monetary figures. Drake picks a handful of beautiful, spacious beats but they are easily forgettable when Drake himself has nothing special to mention. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFavorites: “Still Here”, “Hype”, “Weston Road Flows”, “Keep the Family Close”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLeast Favorites: All those Caribbean ones and “Grammys”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e5/10\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eQuick side notes: “Grammys” feels like a “Future featuring Drake” track and Future is nauseating. I don’t really want to listen to that again despite the fact that What a Time to Be Alive was a generally amusing record. Also, the 6god was afraid to be overshadowed on “Pop Style” by Kanye. “Fire \u0026amp; Desire” was more beautifully spacious filler as we see the 6god once again succumbing to a woman who he can’t have. I was also afraid not a lot of people had heard “Hotline Bling” so it’s good to see it wind up on the track list.\u003c/p\u003e",

From the plethora of pop culture references to the (sometimes questionable) fashion, Gilmore Guys Kevin and Demi are sure to cover it. Never seen \u003ci\u003eGilmore Girls\u003c/i\u003e?

    "title": "Months After Rodeo: Reflecting On Travis Scott // Album Reflection",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By\u003c/i\u003e: Connor Warnick, UCLA Radio DJ (02/09/16)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI cannot say with confidence that an album has given me as much joy as \u003ci\u003eRodeo\u003c/i\u003e has in a long time. No album penetrated my consciousness as deeply as \u003ci\u003eRodeo \u003c/i\u003edid this year. It has now been months after \u003ci\u003eRodeo\u003c/i\u003e, and this album has only gotten better for me. The explosive and gothic production carries listeners on a cinematic adventure through Travis’s life of drugs, sex, fame, and the dark repercussions of such a lifestyle. The expectations following his breakthrough 2014 mixtape, \u003ci\u003eDays Before Rodeo\u003c/i\u003e, that I placed upon this album did not seem possible to surmount, yet \u003ci\u003eRodeo \u003c/i\u003ewas somehow the youthful \u003ci\u003eYeezus \u003c/i\u003ethat I wanted it to be and more. Critics and “serious hip-hop heads” are still caught up with accusing Travis of biting his role models’ ideas, hiding behind bigger names and features, and lacking tangible substance in his music and they continue to ignore his incredible talents and potential. They fail to hear that Travis’s music is possessed in a way that neither Kanye nor Cudi have ever been able to accomplish (“Pornography, “Oh My Dis Side”, and “Never Catch Me” are strong examples of this evil sound that only Travis can really pull off). He does a little bit of everything on this album. He showcases his ever-improving vocal abilities in the forms of his signature autotuned harmonizing, his fiery crooning and wailing, his infectious ad-libs, and his raspy voice as a rapper (the second half of “Ok Alright” is utterly gorgeous). Most of all, it is his amazing ears and eyes that are on display on \u003ci\u003eRodeo\u003c/i\u003e.\u003ci\u003e \u003c/i\u003eThe album’s all-star cast of features and producers includes Kanye West, Metro Boomin, Mike Dean, Young Thug, Quavo, The Weeknd, Chief Keef, Swae Lee, Future, 2 Chainz, T.I., Wondagurl, Pharell, Toro y Moi, Justin Bieber, SZA, and Schoolboy Q, and to me that is an amazing strength of the album, not a shortcoming.\u003ci\u003e \u003c/i\u003eHis ability to curate and engineer the sounds and talents of his friends and peers towards his own aesthetic is displayed throughout the album via a absolutely masterfully produced collection of instrumentals. “3500”, “Pray 4 Love”, and “Piss On Your Grave” all have massive industry names and features (Future, Metro Boomin, The Weeknd, and Kanye), yet they are all clearly catered to Travis and only Travis which is something that Travis deserves a lot of credit for. “90210”, “Nightcrawler”, “Antidote”, “Impossible”, and “Maria I’m Drunk” cohere into an incredibly vibrant depiction of the duality between the endless rage and the dark underbelly of Travis’s nightlife. When listened to in the proper setting (with quality headphones or speakers, and maybe with a little Henny in your system), this album is nothing short of phenomenal. It is a livid and visual experience that no other hip-hop album came close to touching this year from a synesthetic perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Travis has never been great at expressing himself verbally. As he himself has said in interviews as well as on “Apple Pie”, he is not a rapper. Thus, he should not be considered under such terms and expectations. I feel guilty placing him in the same category as artists like Kendrick Lamar, Earl Sweatshirt, or even Future because I feel like he is trying to accomplish such a different goal than they are with his art. He wants his music to be a supplemental experience to the multimedia experience that his arresting videos, his exhilarating concerts, his icy merchandise, and his glowing single/album artwork amount to. As he explained in his interview with \u003ci\u003eComplex\u003c/i\u003e,\u003ci\u003e \u003c/i\u003ehis album was supposed to be released with a bonus USB that theoretically would’ve had additional visuals and material on it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Since he is not a rapper, how should one think of his sound? Travis’s musical genre would be infinitely better described to someone who’s never heard it as something closer to trap-rock, metal/hip-hop, futuristic punk rap, or some hybrid like that, than rap. To me, stylistically, his music and visuals more closely resemble 80’s punk and hair metal bands like The Sex Pistols, Motley Crüe, Metallica, and Guns N’ Roses than Kid Cudi, Kanye, Future, or Drake or any other contemporary artists that I’ve heard him accused of copying. With Future, Cudi, Kanye, and Drake, you can hear their pain and their sadness in their music in different and original ways. But Travis’s sound is evil in a way that theirs has never been (“Skyfall” and “Nothing But Net” are good earlier examples of this). \u003ci\u003eRodeo\u003c/i\u003e reminds me more of Guns ’N’ Roses’s debut album \u003ci\u003eAppetite For Destruction\u003c/i\u003e or my favorite horror movie scores than of \u003ci\u003e808’s and Heartbreak \u003c/i\u003eor either of Cudi’s \u003ci\u003eMan on The Moon \u003c/i\u003ealbums. He has shown over and over in his career that what he lacks in lyrical substance, he more than makes up for in sonic and visual expression and \u003ci\u003eRodeo \u003c/i\u003edisplays that extremely clearly and strongly. So I don’t understand why people expect and demand him to change his method of expression right now if he’s clearly shown that that is not who he is or ever intends to be as an artist. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009My love for this album is ultimately a result of personal taste, but I’ve been trying to dive deeper into both why I adore the dark theatrics of Travis’s music and why most critics and “real” hip-hop fans are so reluctant to like him. I have followed Travis’s career since his first appearance on “Sin City” on Kanye West’s G.O.O.D. Music compilation album, \u003ci\u003eCruel Summer.\u003c/i\u003e Since then, I have traced and stalked his music all the way back to early YouTube treasures like “Lights (Lovesick)” and “That B!tch Crazy”. If you listen to early songs like “Low” and “Analogue”, then his poppier sounding club-bangers like “Antidote”, “Wonderful”, and “Nightcrawler” make more sense. I think people who accuse Travis of biting, faking, and lying misunderstand and marginalize Travis greatly as an artist. I see the cohesiveness between those early unreleased tracks, \u003ci\u003eOwl Pharaoh, Days Before Rodeo, \u003c/i\u003eand \u003ci\u003eRodeo\u003c/i\u003e. It’s clear to me that he is a gifted producer and art director with a taste for dark ’80’s synthesizers, metal guitar riffs, trap drums, and autotune. He has an ephemeral, tortured-soul persona that is hard to grab onto. He lives a turbulent life and his impassioned music and performances reflect that beautifully. He is a new-age “rapper”–a commercialized term that is far more synonymous with “rockstar” than with “storyteller” or “bard” or “poet” in 2016, and I am more than okay with that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009His ceiling is so high. Who else in hip-hop has had such a mastery of unique sounds and visuals at such a young age? Only A$AP Rocky, Tyler, The Creator, and Young Thug come to mind for me. I’m not sure what the future holds for him though. It could certainly go in many directions. It’s interesting that \u003ci\u003eComplex \u003c/i\u003enamed him “The Man of Next Year” for 2016, when I feel like I would’ve called him the man of next year last year. 2015 was supposed to be his big breakthrough, and in some ways it was, but he must be both frustrated with Epic Records for messing up \u003ci\u003eRodeo\u003c/i\u003e’s release as well as disappointed by \u003ci\u003eRodeo\u003c/i\u003e’s relatively underwhelming success. His two newest singles, “Wonderful feat. The Weeknd” and “A-Team”, and his EDM-club banger collaboration with DJ Mustard “Whole Lotta Luvin’”, are more upbeat and less dark than \u003ci\u003eRodeo\u003c/i\u003e. I’m a big fan of “A-Team” and I enjoy dancing to the other two songs, but they feel less like the Travis that I’ve come to love. He claims he has another new album on the way and frankly I hope it does not continue in this poppy direction even if he is frustrated at the critical and commercial response to \u003ci\u003eRodeo\u003c/i\u003e. The other leaks I’ve heard (“Tourist”, “Left Cheek, Right Cheek”) are more encouraging. Regardless of what critics might say, I don’t view Travis as a trend-follower musically. I’ve always believed Trav’s sound has been very progressive and ahead of its time, and I hope that he does not succumb to conformity in order to improve his image and reputation. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009What I want more than anything as a genuine die-hard fan and believer in Travis Scott as an artist is for him to simply ignore his haters and continue to hone in on his individual talents as a producer, curator, director, and vocalist and continue to produce the amazing work that I know he’s capable of. Most people like \u003ci\u003eDays Before Rodeo \u003c/i\u003emore than \u003ci\u003eRodeo\u003c/i\u003e (I don’t personally) because it’s slimmer, more measured, more efficient, and more lyrical. It’s a seemingly more mature project despite preceding \u003ci\u003eRodeo \u003c/i\u003echronologically. Travis is limited as a lyricist because it doesn’t seem like he has much that he’s ever dying to tell us, and that is fine with me. In fact, my least favorite moments on \u003ci\u003eRodeo \u003c/i\u003eare his two attempts at social commentary on “Pray For Love” when he raps unconvincingly, “I’m tired of seeing black kids on the face of \u003ci\u003eFox\u003c/i\u003e” and “Fuck CNN, they don’t wanna see us win”. I am all for promoting social justice, but I don’t think that’s what “Pray For Love” is about and I definitely don’t think that’s who Travis is as an artist.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe always manages to show me sounds and images that convey his story more powerfully than his words can, and I just want him to keep blowing me away with that. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Another take that I have on Travis is that people hate him because he is essentially the ultimate fan boy who made it. He is living out the hypebeast dreams of many of his fans, haters, and critics. However, while a lot of people dislike him for that reason, I feel like that is a reason why I relate to him and his music so much. Listen to the kids! Travis is the favorite artist of almost every kid between the ages of 14-19. He idolized Cudi and Kanye so much that he decided to follow that dream, and then drew inspiration from them on his own terms until he grew into his own identity enough to gain serious attention. Do you realize how inspiring that is for kids of this generation? A Travis Scott concert is not just a thrilling place to mosh, it is a place to be truly inspired and uplifted, and perhaps that is something only the members of today’s youth culture can fully appreciate because their dreams have not died yet.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By\u003c/i\u003e: Zach Seidl, UCLA Radio General Manager (02/03/16)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"331\" data-orig-width=\"400\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d5a7c00bf3b3ff8bb6295c33d44663de/tumblr_inline_o1y7m9G4YI1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"331\" data-orig-width=\"400\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst of all, before you get upset or confused or you laugh so hard your head rolls away and you are unable to reunite it with your body to continue reading this article, I would like to insert the premise that this is not any form of endorsement for the Democrat polling at most 4% in a three candidate race. I will not be voting for Martin O’Malley. It is important though, that he is running and that the viewers of the Democratic debates listen to what he says instead of talking over him, decrying his irrelevance. Is Martin O’Malley going to win the Democratic nomination? No. Is he going to win one state in primary? I’d be willing to bet that he won’t and willing to bet my life that he won’t win more than two. Despite this, when I see the Governor on the stage of the debate, a sense of relief washes over me. He makes me feel that anyone can run for president if you have good ideas, a positive track record, millions of dollars (of course) and a following of at least 2% of polled Democrats. As Gov. O’Malley speaks, I know he knows that he is not going to win and the fact that he is still up there is admirable to me. The fact that he will not win is not reason enough to ignore him. We must be more mature than that. I implore fellow democrats to at least listen to the man during the debates and take note on what he has to say because he might be our best shot at dethroning President Rubio in 2020.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

The fact that Earthen Sea and Aurora Halal were to play live sets in conjunction with the distinguished reputation of the label Lovers Rock and promotion company Fine Time set expectations high.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWithout an RSVP to the event you would have been wildly lost. From the street we pushed past a nondescript metal screen door, which even a savvy partygoer could have easily missed. As we walked up the two flights of dimly lit stairs, the music grew gradually louder until finally we emerged into a white room decorated with a centerpiece of leafy plants. \u003ca href=\"http://www.shawnmerz.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eShawn Merz\u003c/a\u003e, an alumnus of UCLA, had created two installations of flora and wire for the event. This room opened up to another space, flanked on either side by beige patterned couches. After moving through the space, we finally came upon the room where the music was coming from. This room was a bit small considering the undeniable allure of the Lovers Rock artists, but the sound was loud enough that attendees could still hear the music quite well from any of the other rooms, which encouraged socializing in the entirety of the space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the main room, atmosphere was created by a smoke machine paired with a single laser projector to the right of the DJ booth. The light machine was projecting trippy visuals across the crowd and onto the opposite corner of the opposite wall. The bass was so heavy that the entire wood floor was reacting dramatically, which in conjunction with the hyper-crowded room of people, gave the illusion that we could’ve fallen through the floor at any moment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"669\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d177dfa4bc43101d344eddb8f4ba5d1f/tumblr_inline_o1vrngqnxG1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"669\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eDamon Eliza Palermo opened the night. Palermo is a Los Angeles based dance music producer. Late last year he released \u003ci\u003eClouds of David\u003c/i\u003e for 1080p, but his jams Saturday night were much more ready for the dance floor than his ambient release.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"669\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b16c29ba8cd60acfeb63490e1aac5b26/tumblr_inline_o1vrocVeY51qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"669\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eUp next was a live set from San Francisco native Jacob Long, who goes by Earthen Sea. His set was made up of sublime drones and dub textures, layered with a light house pulse. This segment was an ideal transition between Damon Eliza Palermo and Aurora. It was integrated seamlessly with its preceding set it while leaving the audience with a taste of what was to come by preparing them for something harder. Earthen Sea created Lovers Rock’s first full-length LP, \u003ci\u003eInk\u003c/i\u003e, which was released late last year and enjoyed favorable reviews for its washed-out melodies and trippy immersive qualities.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"669\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/55467645c6cb353c2da8eb9a6290c4ab/tumblr_inline_o1vrpx7CN31qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"669\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAurora Halal was a sorceress on top of her game, as per usual. Her broken beat kicks with massive synth stabs sent the entire room into oblivion. She did a great job of building the energy the entire time she played, and never let up. In addition to being a DJ, Aurora is a visual artist, musician, and promoter based in Brooklyn, New York – who founded the label Mutual Dreaming and co-founded Sustain-Release. It was a gift to be able to see Aurora perform live after what Resident Advisor dubbed “her biggest year yet,” marked by an EP on Mutual Dreaming and touring across the US and Europe.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"669\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/733497d9703c7c8083815779e6373029/tumblr_inline_o1vrqpOXyz1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"669\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eItal closed with diverse and eclectic selections – both in terms of genre and in his fresh versus old school material. Despite a few rough transitions, his selections were on point and he kept the vibe going strong into the late night, accomplishing what he set out to do. Daniel Martin-McCormick, based in Brooklyn, founded the label Lovers Rock in 2008 and has explored a wide range of genres over his career, finally arriving at dance music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt 5AM the lights came on in the smoky room and the small crowd left standing filed out over the sticky floors. The leafy floor centerpiece was spread across the room in a way that illustrated the interactivity of the piece and made it even more beautiful. As we were birthed into the industrial night, the magnitude of the talented musicians that we had just witnessed sunk in and continued to astound me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCatch the \u003ca href=\"http://www.residentadvisor.net/event.aspx?795299\" target=\"_blank\"\u003enext Club Time show\u003c/a\u003e on February 5\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e to see performances by Soichi Terada, Olin, Guillaume, and Tahl K.\u003c/p\u003e",

David Bowie cited Kendrick Lamar as being an influence on the experimental routes this album takes, but I think the finished product joins the likes of Swans in terms of a raw and unhinged rock performance. The fact that this man has provided a soundtrack to his death is unsettling on its own, but the added experimentation and overall freakish tone make each track more exhilarating than the last.  The final two tracks, “Dollar Days” and “I Can’t Give Everything Away” pursue a more ballad-like approach, however.  These songs provide a refreshing contrast to the aggression present on the bulk of this album, but remain somber enough to fit within the larger picture.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe self-awareness of \u003ci\u003eBlackstar \u003c/i\u003ereally works to its advantage.  Not only does Bowie come to terms with his impending death during the course of this LP, he also embraces his age and the weakening of his voice in a way that, ironically, makes it sound very impactful.  The song “Girl Loves Me” comes to mind as Bowie sings with an exasperated, and equally desperate infliction that is sure to grasp the listener’s attention. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy only complaint about this LP is that the instrumentation struggles to keep up with the vocals on many occasions.  When someone like James Murphy isn’t providing live drumming on tracks like “Sue” and “Girl Loves Me” for example, the instruments begin to sound a little too mechanistic for my taste. There can be advantages to tightly controlled instrumentation, but an album like \u003ci\u003eBlackstar \u003c/i\u003emight have benefitted from more unrestrained performances on that front.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eBlackstar \u003c/i\u003eis undoubtedly one of the braver records I’ve heard in quite some time.  Not just as far as experimentation and risk-taking, but also in the manner that David Bowie handles his own impending mortality.  The subject of death is explored tirelessly in modern music yet it’s an entirely different experience to hear a record from someone at the cusp of it.  It’s rare that someone will get to say goodbye before his passing, and even more rare that he’ll treat his death as an opportunity for an art project.  An album like this is exemplary of the man’s insanity, but also his devotion to music and showmanship until very end.\u003c/p\u003e",

Fine Time gave birth to a wonderful microcosm that transcended the physical and manifested on some ethereal level that epitomized how electronic music and the unadulterated bliss of the dance floor is a universal lubricant for connection.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe event was a creation of Fine Time, the brainchild of Kate Stimac and Tahl Klainman, who met in their time at UCLA. \u003ca href=\"http://www.finetimela.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTheir website\u003c/a\u003e defines themselves as “a live-music promotion company based in Los Angeles that programs concerts in different locales throughout the city.” Fine Time provides a pedestal for emerging and overlooked artists spanning all genres. Among other genre-specific nights, the company puts on Club Time, a house and techno affair focusing on both established and rising artists.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eFine Time’s assembly of show-specific environments was showcased here in the minimal production, which coupled harmoniously with the house and techno. Fog machines worked the whole night as projectors beamed brilliant light work into the crowd. The conjunction of these two elements created the perfect atmosphere in a way that was not overbearing or contrived and perfectly suited the space and the music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe night was an assortment of artists working under the label White Material. This New York and Berlin based label was founded by DJ Richard and Young Male in 2012 \u003ca href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/09/03/436632883/songs-we-love-dj-richard-bane\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eas they emerged from Rhode Island School of Design\u003c/a\u003e. The tight-knit nature of the group was tangible in the DJs’ seamless transitions from set to set. White Material prides themselves in making “working man’s techno,” which was evident this Friday night in the group’s skill at producing A1 music, while keeping it accessible to a large population.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe arrived early, as the event page and location e-mail suggested. On a poorly lit row of predominantly unmarked warehouses, our Über driver slowed down and announced that we had arrived. Standing in the middle of an industrial street somewhere in Boyle Heights, we could hear techno ghostly emanating from one warehouse, and the smell of food wafted out along with it. It was chilly – by Los Angeles standards near freezing – outside, which made entering the warehouse feel like coming in from the cold that much more inviting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen we entered Tahl greeted us with hugs, radiating positive and welcoming energy. I got the chance to speak with him about the venue, the universal appeal of White Material, and how clutch it is to have food at a show. He fondly rehashed how in his time at UCLA, he was a member of Student Committee for the Arts and a DJ for UCLA Radio. He asked me how I had heard about the event and followed by saying he was always curious as to how people had wound up there. Since the location is secretive, announced three hours before the event via e-mail only to those that had RSVP’d, nobody in the crowd was there by accident.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"500\" data-orig-width=\"500\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc9ac2fde062994b5949631747e568ff/tumblr_inline_o0zituNJ8Y1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"500\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe expansive entry room had refreshments and a food stand serving up kimchi and pulled pork quesadillas on the opposite end of the room, which made me feel like I could’ve lived my entire life there. Past a plastic curtain was the room with the DJ booth which, when we arrived fifteen minutes after the doors had opened, was inundated with smoke from two fog machines and holding only about six other attendees – generating a post-apocalyptic vibe that Alvin Aronson’s pulsating opening set certainly helped to reinforce. Aronson is newer to the label, and his work on \u003ci\u003eWM007\u003c/i\u003e certainly informed what he opened the night with: a special brand of drone techno.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGalcher Lustwerk went after him. A native of Ohio, Galcher Lustwerk graduated from RISD the same year as DJ Richard. His trademark is spoken words and rapping over deep house, a technique that has earned him a large fan base and is especially evident in his seminal mix \u003ci\u003e100% Galcher\u003c/i\u003e. The prolific artist has done work under Ghostly International, White Material, and his own label Lustwerk Music, among others. The inclusion of tracks featuring his vocals – most memorably the banger “Put On” – in the set was enthusiastically lapped up by the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNext up came DJ Richard, who played a rad acid-soaked set. His set was a blend of the subdued house, ventures into drone, and serene looping heard on his 2015 album \u003ci\u003eGrind\u003c/i\u003e and the noise and house that he was previously known for. This was perhaps as a result of his relocation to Berlin, the hub of techno. Richard seemingly haphazardly intentionally stopped his set twice to wait for applause, so when he was interrupted a third time by the power going out for about two minutes it was difficult to tell if it was for effect or whether it was a genuine power outage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eQuinn Taylor, who goes by Young Male, closed with a precise and energizing techno set with a drop of house. His intermittent fist pumping mirrored the crowd’s. Among some of techno-whistle-inducing jams he played was “Zombie Machine” by Gesloten Cirkle, which was an unreal conjunction with a Kraftwerk track that had cats on the dance floor losing their minds. He played the tightest set of the night, but when someone screamed “he’s the headliner!” in my ear with regards to Taylor I couldn’t help but think how co-dependent and complementary the four sets had been and how each of the skilled artists had brought something completely different to the table.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"500\" data-orig-width=\"500\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/77c2ba4878e85828c568a7089ab68c5f/tumblr_inline_o0ziu8sNej1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"500\" data-orig-width=\"500\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe \u003cb\u003eunifying\u003c/b\u003e power of the music and the space really struck me. A sea of 20-somethings dressed in monochrome and baseball caps/beanies has the potential to be an intimidating environment but manifested as accessible and welcoming. The crowd was racially and sexually diverse but music was connecting. The minimal use of smartphones was impressive considering the median age of the crowd was smack-dab in the middle of the millennial generation. The few cultural outliers, like the one douchey-looking guy in a fitted gray suit and man bun, weren’t paid much attention to, as everyone’s focus was so wholly devoted to enjoying the music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDon’t miss \u003ca href=\"https://www.xlr8r.com/news/2016/01/fine-time-bring-white-material-and-lovers-rock-to-los-angeles\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eClub Time’s upcoming night\u003c/a\u003e featuring Ital, Aurora Halal, Damon Eliza Palermo, and Earthen Sea representing the label Lovers Rock on January 23rd.

A unique venue, a fluid set list, and an organic chemistry between the audience and the band allowed for a mellow Monday night. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The Center for the Arts in Eagle Rock is formerly a library, which gives it a historic feel. Culture seeps through the walls. Metallic brown chandeliers frame the room, and the remnants of the librarian’s desk function as a bar for refreshments. Connan and his gang came on stage in their goofy outfits- Connan himself and his bass player rocked low braided pigtails. Connan wore a captain’s hat, all setting the tone for the show ahead. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The set was fluid and improvisational. Transitions from song to song either happened where it was just the band’s way of grooving, as if a song was a sentence and they were unable to find a place to end the thought. Or it was the complete opposite, they would end a song and have a little pause where neither them or the audience knew what to do. However, it was ok. Even the awkward pauses were genuine. Connan Mockasin was uncomfortable in their uncomfortableness, being authentic to themselves. It never seemed like they were pushing for a certain aesthetic, rather they rolled with their essence as a psychedelic rock band from New Zealand. Their set had a wonderful mix of ups and downs, as they did a great job of holding and releasing tension. Further, they did not stay at the same volume for the set. It went up and down adding fuel to the songs that deserved the push. During Forever Dolphin Love, the band went off bringing spirits up super high and letting them flow when the song allowed. The show felt intimate and was the furthest from a show where you feel that you’re just listening to a band’ record in a big room. Rather, this show felt more like a jam session, one where you were homies with Connan Mockasin and they called you up to hang around. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe dialogue during song breaks was quirky. Some of the stuff Connan would say was basically incomprehensible due to his accent, soft voice, and some drugs or a lot of beer I’m sure. People from the audience would yell out song suggestions, and he would blatantly curve them. Personally, I find it obnoxious for peeps to do that, but to each his own. The worst part was when someone called out “Caramel” and his response was “yo we already played that one.” There was still a comfortable connection between band and audience, and I felt that the people around me were engaged and enjoying it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eConnan Mockasin’s show at Center for the Arts Eagle Rock was the most rad way to spend a Monday night during finals week. I’m super happy I got to have the experience and I hope he comes around again soon. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCheck out his current project with Dev Hynes from Blood Orange titled Myths 001. It’s a three song project and my personal favorite is Feelin’ Lovely. \u003c/p\u003e",

It’s wrong to piss\non the American flag.” The joke told by Entertainment’s unnamed comedian protagonist opens\nthe film and hurls the audience into a two hour Discomfort Simulator. Rick Alverson forces the\nfeelings of the washed-up comedian on tour through Meth Valley (read: the Mojave Desert) onto\nan unassuming audience. The film lowers us into the murky psyche of the comedian (an homage\nto actor Gregg Turkington’s Neil Hamburger character) holding out to find something worth\nliving for. The film stands as a masterpiece of ‘cinematic functionalism’ as the cinematic form of\nthe film effectively recreates an existential crisis for the audience. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA work of ‘entertainment’ fastens the audience in for a high-speed chase down PCH, but\nEntertainment moves with the sangfroid of a debilitated elevator. Each shot is (intentionally) too\nlong in duration. For example, at a particularly pathetic point in the comedian’s tour he blows a\nraspberry for well over a minute—the audience in the movie, as well as the real-life audience, are\nforced to wait out the uncomfortableness. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe film is comprised of wide angle shots with negative spaces taking up most of the\nscreen, and the general emptiness makes for underwhelming views. With nothing else to see on\nthe screen, a single focal point quickly draws the eye in. As each shot drags on, the viewer’s eye\nstarts to wander. The shot continues to drag on and the eye of the viewer becomes restless. We\ncontinue waiting, our expectation bubbling; the silence still builds, and: nothing happens. We,\ntoo, have fallen into the existential pitfall. And with each scene, there comes another glimmer of\nhope—another chance for meaning to take place. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the time finally comes that action is taking place, we start to try to make meaning\nof out of our desperate situations. At a motel we are introduced to a beautiful presenter leading a\nseminar on the healing nature of various shades of color. As each color is presented along with a\nhost of the flaws it treats, the audience internally scrambles to make something from this\nseminar. But though instances of colored lights are present throughout the remainder of the film,\nthese instances are disjunctive, a faux motif. Like a man with nothing left to live for, we start to\ncreate something out of the steady-stream-of-nothing that life throws at us. We try to rationalize\nentropy, but looking for purpose in chaos is as futile as finding solitude in a wood chipper. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe pitfall the protagonist finds himself in is far from inescapable. His cousin and his coperformer\nopen themselves up to the comedian, offering a helping hand to pull him away from\nhimself—but true to his fatalistic character, the comedian refuses to be helped. Even the angelic\nhostess from the seminar cleanses the comedian in showers of color, but while our Dante\ncontinues to circle through the Circles of Hell he refuses salvation from this Beatrice. Similarly,\nthe pitfall we find ourselves in is far from inescapable. This trapping is self-imposed, for we, the\naudience, in fact paid for a ticket to see the movie. We have the agency to leave the theater thus\nending this suffering, but we want our money’s worth; so we sit in anxious anticipation waiting\nfor something to happen.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWords By:\u003c/i\u003e Aaron Peretz, UCLA Radio DJ\u003c/p\u003e",

While not his worst work (if you can possibly even use a word like “worst” to describe John Maus’ music), it is also not his best. This may disappoint even some of his most generous fans, given that the grace period between his two most recent albums was so substantial. Back in November of 2014 he even tweeted at an impatient follower about how he was “shooting for 2015!! Only just finished a dissertation and building the instruments” he needed. Nonetheless, the record has arrived and it doesn’t stray very far from what he is known for: extravagant reverb, minimal lyrics, and luxurious synthesizers. Synthesizers which he built himself, and that in the end \u0026ldquo;didn\u0026rsquo;t really make that much of a difference sonically,\u0026rdquo; according to a slighty disappointed Maus. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DR1ESwMq8z-0\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/R1ESwMq8z-0?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" gesture=\"media\" allow=\"encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile “Touchdown” seems to be the favorite according to the Spotify Top Ten list, “Bombs Away” should have taken that spot, in my opinion. The instruments were clearer and more distinguished than ever, allowing for a refreshing add to his discography. Particularly in his earlier music, circa album \u003ci\u003eSongs\u003c/i\u003e, prominence would never have even been considered, only beautifully muddled harmonious chaos was able to shine. Along with “Bombs Away”, “Walls of Silence” stood out respectably, this actually snagging the number eight spot on his Top Ten hits on Spotify. “Walls of Silence” holds an extra repetitive nature close to its structure, yet without still having the negative connotations that come with the word monotony. That particular song could be played on loop and after a certain point the beginning nor the end would be able to stand out, in a good way. In a way where if one were to lay on the cold hardwood of their bedroom floor all by themselves on a lonely Saturday night, only to to have this song on repeat, they would fall deep into a warm amber embrace, and a forgiving trance within their own thoughts only a natural disaster could shock them out of. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/50Trv9V4O6AUqYOCm5HUG8\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten by Maddie Young \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeing a female on the internet can be an obstacle to navigate rather than a mere personal feature in many online communities. While I’m proud to say that I don’t make a grand effort to hide my identity online, sometimes I wish it was even possible. This was one of those instances.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI had been trying for years to find a platform to sell my crocheted crop tops, a pastime I had picked up in high school when I spent winter after San Diego winter on the beach. I had almost forgotten about my search when I stumbled upon the perfect place. It was an app called letgo that allowed one to sell within a community of one’s choosing, connecting local buyers and sellers and eliminating the need to ship. For safety, the app allowed for verification with social media accounts so that you could see who you were buying and selling from. Wary of the app still, I took it for a test before using it to sell my own things. I ventured to purchase a Levi’s acid-wash jean jacket from a woman who lived not fifteen minutes away from me. Her husband had worn it in the 80’s, and now it was mine for a mere eighteen dollars and a half hour of my time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFeeling reassured that other women were vendors on this app and that the seller could choose the meeting location, I posted my first item for sale. It was a light blue, scalloped halter top that I’d crocheted long ago, but never worn. While experimenting with angle after angle to photograph the product lying on my wood floor, I decided it would make more sense to put it on for a modeled shot.  After all, how is anyone supposed to know what size this handmade halter was if they couldn’t see it on a person? I took a photo to show the true fit, keeping it as modest as I could and trusting that the fellow denizens of North County San Diego would respect my posting. Within just one hour of putting the item up for sale, I was ecstatic to receive an offer! The series of messages read like this:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eHi, I’m [insert buyer name here]\u003c/i\u003e, they started.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eyikes. \u003c/i\u003eThey added in a new line of text.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eYou have been blocked by this user.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eConfused by this string of choices and hoping to find some enlightenment, I checked their profile and saw that they had been able to sell more than ten items with the set of social skills that they possessed. Shaking off this strange encounter, I forged on with the hope that not all interactions with buyers would be so nonsensical and one-sided. Minutes later, I received another potential offer. Optimistic that this user was actually interesting in buying my item, I opened the message.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eDid you make this? \u003c/i\u003ethey asked.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eYes! I can do custom fits too\u003c/i\u003e, I replied industriously, proud to share my craft with people of all sizes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eDo you have lace thong or thong to go with? Used?\u003c/i\u003e They inquired.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was fairly certain that this man was taken by more than just my even stitching. Curious about who this person was, I checked their profile and saw that they had somehow obtained a five star rating. I hoped that this hadn’t set some sellers at ease to meet with this man, only for him to request unsolicited and inappropriate favors in person. Fortunately for me, I knew what he was after without ever having to come face to face with him and could weigh the options on my own. While the promise of selling and hand-delivering my own used undergarments to a stranger seemed both enticing and safe, I decided against it. I promptly deleted the app, giving up on both my sales endeavour and my hope in the internet. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile I know that the app was trying to create a safe haven by allowing its users to link their social media accounts for verification, I believe that they could have done more. To start, they could extend the security check beyond essentially confirming that the user has an email address, despite how many laborious seconds it takes to obtain one. In contrast, ride-sharing app Ride Safr goes so far as to meet its drivers in person for interviews before hiring them. The app also includes an SOS button in the app if something goes awry during your ride, making incidents more traceable. Regardless of the need for improvement in preventing inappropriate behavior among users of letgo, the unfortunate moral of this story remains: if you are a woman on the internet, any photo that you post of yourself will be interpreted by some people as an invitation for harassment. \u003c/p\u003e",

Identifying as queercore, the band has a fast hardcore sound and lyrical themes concerning gay identity politics. The mixing of album is something which also stood out to me, it’s able to polished without sounding over produced. Martin’s vocal style perfectly matches the killer riffs and speedy drums in both intensity and aggression. Halfway through this album, the band’s sound switches to a disco-ey almost dark-wave- techno sound which they pull of with perfection.

Wolf Alice - Visions Of A Life\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLooking back at this past September, I remember sitting in my apartment late at night, counting down until midnight when Wolf Alice’s second record \u003ci\u003eVisions of a Life\u003c/i\u003e would be released. I haven’t ever heard anything quite like \u003ci\u003eVisions of a Life\u003c/i\u003e before, and I think the reason it resonates so much with me is the way it perfectly encompasses the feelings that come with the uncertainty of young adulthood, and the feelings of life in general - love, anger, sadness, extreme joy, and everything in between. The album digs itself into darkness, but at its core, lies a piece of work that is ambitious, honest, and a solid listen from start to finish.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2.

With tracks like ‘When the World Was at War’ and ‘God Bless America’ we see Del Rey take a more honest approach from her Americana aesthetic as she speaks of the hard times people in this country face. With tracks like ‘Get Free’ she delivers her mission statement: “Finally, I’m crossing the threshold/From the ordinary world/To the reveal of my heart,” She’s honest, she’s free, with a much optimism and a lust for life. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2.

Her sophomore album, \u003ci\u003eMelodrama\u003c/i\u003e, captures her youth, her growth, her path to becoming a woman of her own and loving herself and all the ephemeral experiences in between. Mastering her craft, Lorde finds a cohesion between her atmospheric synths, harmonies, beats and the bittersweet wisdom in her lyrics. Especially in \u0026ldquo;Liability,\u0026rdquo; a beautiful piano-ballad where she sings, \u0026ldquo;I understand, I\u0026rsquo;m a liability/ Get you wild, make you leave/ I\u0026rsquo;m a little much for everyone.\u0026rdquo; Lorde is truly one of a kind and \u003ci\u003eMelodrama\u003c/i\u003e proves she is one of the best artists today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2.

He had a contagious exuberance as he pranced around during his set. Much to everyone’s surprise, two-thirds of the Chicago-based electronic trio Autograf (Louis Kha and Jake Carpenter) also came to play at the Wiltern show - they were originally only scheduled for the Observatory show the next day. Guest appearances are arguably one of the highlights of live shows, particularly in EDM (shoutout to our UCLA alumni-founded music event organizer, Brownies and Lemonade.)   \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was intrigued by the four looming Chinese words that flashed repeatedly in the backdrop, 流芳百世, which I was quick to assume was their music mantra. The phrase means to pass on a tradition or ideology to many more generations to come, which matches very well with their SoundCloud bio: “It’s about leaving your mark in the world. It’s about leaving your Autograf (autograph).” Jake was playing the beats live throughout the show, which I dare say is not very common, and may be the first EDM show I have seen that incorporated such extensive live instrumentals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eClassified as part of the future electronic genre, Autograf is definitely setting the bar high up for what up-and-coming house music performances should entail. \u003ca href=\"https://musicianbio.org/autograf-2/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMusicianBio\u003c/a\u003e reveals that Autograf keeps a lot of its production in-house, from the stage installations to its album artwork, thus walking the talk of their dream to revolutionize digital music picture. From the vibrant lighting, pink and yellow, I could definitely see how Andy Warhol’s fascination with pop art serves as an inspiration to their look and feel. Arguably, I see more traces of hypebeast vibes on their socials, particularly Instagram and their merchandise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1666\" data-orig-width=\"2500\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/32c2eb0e88174165020cb96a0aba0549/tumblr_inline_p09awpCYAB1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1666\" data-orig-width=\"2500\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn terms of music, it was a little more dramatic than what I was expecting. I have always defaulted to listening to Autograf on SoundCloud when I needed ambient music to listen to while studying, and most of their original music is more laid back. However, they tried to mix things up a little in their live performance and threw in a couple of trap songs, as well as songs that reminded me of Sam Feldt’s music (I attribute it to the prominent horn solos in the songs.) Of course they also played their top hits like “Sleepless in NYC,” “Simple,” and “You Might Be.” “Sleepless in NYC” did not disappoint, although if I could wish for one thing, it would be that they played with a xylophone as well, like they did in this \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BZkXjrhA_rV/?taken-by=autografmusic\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram video\u003c/a\u003e. Nonetheless, the headbanger they played towards the end of the show was a great segway into Gryffin’s high-energy performance. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter much anticipation, Gryffin started his set almost three and a half hours into the show. It began with him drumming intensively with flashing lights in the backdrop, marking his presence to the stage. He proceeded to hit the keys, showing his full range of musical talent right off the bat. We were all directed shortly after to put our hands up in the sky, partially mirroring the theme of the tour.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1666\" data-orig-width=\"2500\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8d909d84d4e27247d143ee9545d59830/tumblr_inline_p09axhsIg31qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1666\" data-orig-width=\"2500\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eGryffin playing the drums \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the Japanese caricatures and neon street signs featured in one of the screen display designs, taiko drumming style, and his clothing and bandana, Gryffin had the full package of an incredibly musically talented anime character. These little things differentiate him from other artists, as I felt fully immersed in his performance. The gear that he wears to all his shows reminds me of Japanese school uniforms (towards the trendier, more fashionable end of the spectrum.) The lights in the back even flashed in sync with the beats on his drums, just like how it does in the taiko drum games I played as a kid at the arcade in Hong Kong. Although the lighting plays a role in delivering the performance, I would not say it is as dominant as it is with other EDM artists, especially trap-heavy or larger artists at music festivals. Going down memory lane, the tour’s name references a famous Japanese animation that I watched as a kid of the same name, “Castle in the Sky.” It was a largely imaginative animation - I guess Gryffin was going off tangent of being futuristic in his musical production as well in the future bass genre.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1407\" data-orig-width=\"2500\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1166b49298d90889eb882c5daa6ac56a/tumblr_inline_p09ayqICPa1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1407\" data-orig-width=\"2500\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eGryffin and Katie Pearlman\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGryffin brought out not one, but two of his singers - Bipolar Sunshine for “Whole Heart” and Katie Pearlman for “Nobody Compares to You.” I love it when vocalists are showcased at the DJ’s live performances - the synergy is much more amplified, as opposed just hearing a song get blasted out of the speakers (followers could easily just do that at home!)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe also did not skimp on playing his popular remixes, such as “Feel Good ft.

He leaves behind his wife and two kids along with countless fans. Halladay pitched for the Toronto Blue Jays from 1998-2009 and the Philadelphia Phillies from 2010-2013. In his 15 year career, he had a 203-105 record with a career ERA of 3.38, and notched over 2000 strikeouts. He was an eight time all-star, two time Cy Young Award winner, led the league in wins twice, and pitched a perfect game and a postseason no hitter in the same year (2010). His impact on the field is only overshadowed by his impact off the field. During his time in Toronto, him and his wife created “Doc’s Box,” which encouraged many to donate to The Hospital for Sick Children during games. Along with this, he was often times the finalist for the Roberto Clemente Award, which highlights a player’s contributions off the field. I would like to share my story on this future Hall of Famer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;m a die-hard Reds fan through and through - all my life I have been. When I was in the sixth grade, the Make-A-Wish Foundation flew me and my family to Cincinnati to meet the Reds and attend a game. The point is they mean everything to me, and at that point in 2010 they had never made the postseason in my life. That year felt right though. Everything was going for them. I even became great friends with Jay Bruce! Needless to say, when he hit the walk off to clinch the division against the Astros, I flipped. I mean, I felt a little of it was because of me :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen I hear we were facing the Phillies. Oh boy. I knew we had a huge challenge, especially with Halladay. The day that match up came, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t sit still. I was so nervous at school, yet upset because I couldn\u0026rsquo;t watch the game there. Then I hear my principal tell me my dad was here to get me for an emergency. Naturally, I knew what was going on. I was stoked when I saw him and realized we were about to relax at home and watch the game together. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis moment in my life this was one of the most exciting things to ever happen\u0026hellip;then the game started. We all know what happened\u0026hellip;I imagined that the Reds might lose. I thought if that came to fruition I\u0026rsquo;d be devastated. And to be honest, until about the seventh inning, I was. But then I realized what was actually happening. I mean, oh my God, a playoff no hitter and by the Doc himself! When the game ended, of course I was sad. But I saw victory in defeat. I took a step outside of my shoes as a Reds fan and looked through the lens of a baseball fan. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEver since that, when the Reds blow it (especially these past few years), I\u0026rsquo;m reminded of that no hitter. I look at our 90+ loss season we had (again) and I try to see the greatness that still occurred:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBarnhart wins gold glove over Molina and Posey\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSix of our hitters with over 20 dinger\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVotto MVP season \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHunter Greene and other young pitchers in the system\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe point of all this is that Doc taught me how to see the positive in an otherwise seemingly hopeless situation. And for that, and for him, I will always be grateful. \u003c/p\u003e",

The tension dispersed once Caesar arrived and opened with his single “Japanese Denim.” Throughout the night, Caesar repped Toronto and the music scene by bringing out Toronto-based artists Jessie Reyez and Charlotte Day Wilson. Syd also made a surprise appearance for their song “Take Me Away.” Caesar even brought out Arin Ray, after announcing that he would listen to Ray’s song “We Ain’t Homies” non-stop while on tour.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"2769\" data-orig-width=\"4281\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d37f06db7bf836194907fb075339d940/tumblr_inline_ozd7phSFb51qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"2769\" data-orig-width=\"4281\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b81ba5f3a841ecaa72c751936c5d813e/tumblr_inline_ozd7pk0kUd1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom Caesar’s past appearances in LA at the Echo and UCLA’s Jazz Reggae Fest, it’s clear that performing his music is as easy as breathing for him.

    "title": "Mitski and Palehound @ The Fonda (10/22) // Show Review",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten by Jennifer Ward\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe two most prominent groups of people at the Mitski show at the Fonda were (1) the high school indie art kids, as characterized by an intense and vocal desire to attend NYU, high waisted mom jeans, and an aversion to Sonic Youth, and (2) the indie art kids dressed in all black whose every conversation eventually circles back to Death Grips. I had trouble with reconciling the presence of both very different groups, but then I realized: it’s Mitski. She has both the technical appeal of strong arrangements and melodies in addition to the emotional appeal of overly relatable sadgirl lyrics. It makes sense. I had lukewarm feelings about Palehound after watching their \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjIvKvXjhas\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNPR Tiny Desk performance\u003c/a\u003e, but my opinion quickly changed after hearing “Feeling Fruit,” a heartbreaking song about loss. This, the silly lyrics, and the super cute bass player more than balanced out the sometimes excessive and slightly detracting Dinosaur Jr. influence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMitski came onto the stage with sparkly kitten heels, a black dress and strong looking shoulders. Her elegance and delicate fluttering vocals, even on her scream-y Audiotree rendition of “Class of 2013,” prepared me in no way for the air of confidence and understanding she exuded. After the applause, someone in the crowd yelled out, “Do you like girls?” Mitski smiled for an instant before beginning a dark bassline. The emotional intensity of the performance slowly built through the set.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMitski performed songs dealing with chronic depression with simultaneous raw emotion and straight-backed confidence. Mitski represents a very specific intersection that is frequently ignored by artistic expression - most artwork does not represent what it is to be a woman, or what it is to be queer, or what it is to be Asian, or what it is to be Asian-American. “Best American Girl,” in contrast, addresses the difficult choice between conforming to white heterosexuality and realizing an individual identity. To be in a space where these experiences were actively recognized and portrayed as a source of pride was a cathartic experience for many.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMitski took her hair down before beginning the solo portion of her set. Back to back, she played “My Body’s Made of Crushed Little Stars,” “A Burning Hill,” and “Class of 2013,” making for a beautifully sad set finale. Returning for an encore, she fittingly whispered “Last Words of a Shooting Star,” whose vocals end halfway through the last chorus - “goodbye.”\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Judah Friedlander - America is The Greatest County // Stand Up Review",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten by Moses Mascuch \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Judah Friedlander takes the stage at the start of his new comedy special, \u003ci\u003eAmerica Is The Greatest Country In The United States\u003c/i\u003e, he looks like a man who has been living alone in a cabin for many years. His eyes are hidden behind thick glasses, which shine beneath the brim of his trucker cap. The words begin to trickle out from the guise of a mountain man, complete with long hair and a scraggly beard. Unfortunately, it’s not just Friedlander’s appearance that makes it seem like he’s been out of touch with society. It’s his jokes, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u0009America Is The Greatest Country In The United States\u003c/i\u003e is an unorthodox comedy special that combines footage, filmed in black and white, from three separate nights. Despite the caliber of the venue, the Comedy Cellar in New York, the special has a gritty do-it-yourself vibe. Because of the Cellar’s small space, no matter where the camera is, Friedlander takes up most of the frame, giving the special an intimacy absent from those at larger venues. This intimacy is true of Friedlander’s material, too, which relies heavily on crowd work and audience suggestions. A major part of the special is Friedlander’s riffs on where various audience members are from, and his delivery and stage presence renders his remarks indistinguishable from the pre-written material. Friedlander takes a lot of risks in his special, but for the most part they pay off.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009What brings the special down is ultimately that Friedlander doesn’t tread any new comedic ground. \u003ci\u003eAmerica Is The Greatest Country In The United States\u003c/i\u003e is, at its heart, a satire of American exceptionalism. Friedlander highlights America’s deepest flaws, and instead of decrying them, explains why they prove America is great. Why do women in America get almost no maternity leave? Because women in America care about the economy. If this kind of humor seems familiar, that’s because it is. Friedlander’s satire follows the tradition of the Colbert Report and arguably Michael Moore in ironically justifying all of America’s shortcomings. Thing A is bad, but it’s actually good for wacky reason B, cue laughter. Other than straight-up outrage, this has been comedy’s main method of critiquing America for as long as my millennial butt has been paying attention. In this way, Friedlander\u0026rsquo;s jokes are destined to fall flat, propelled as they are by such a tired style. Also, in light of our current political climate, it’s worth asking if this is still a valuable or effective method of critique. What is the purpose of ironically exposing fringe nationalists beliefs when they’re the same beliefs held by the current White House? The humor of much of Friedlander’s special relies on absurdity, he seems to say, “Imagine if someone really thought this.” Unfortunately, we don’t have to imagine anymore. The fictional deranged  nationalist Friedlander’s comedy conjures is real, and occupies the White House. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Despite his somewhat outdated subject matter, Friedlander remains an exceptional comedic performer. The deadpan comedy style that served him so well on \u003ci\u003e30 Rock\u003c/i\u003e is perfected here, as Friedlander is able to keep a low-key energy while still generating big laughs. At his best, Friedlander can completely blindside you with an out-of-left-field punchline delivered so matter-of-factly that it sneaks up on you. One that has stuck in my head is, “I went to China and met a five-year-old boy. His toy said ‘I made this.’” Simple, absurd, but delivered like it’s the most natural thing in the world. There are some laugh-out-loud moments in \u003ci\u003eAmerica Is The Greatest Country In The United States\u003c/i\u003e, especially towards the end as Friedlander drops his ironic justifications of America’s flaws, and plays more heavily on interacting with the audience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Ultimately, the best parts of \u003ci\u003eAmerica Is The Greatest Country In The United States\u003c/i\u003e can be attributed to Friedlander’s personal style: his deadpan, off-the-cuff delivery, his deft control of a crowd, his absurdist outlook. Conversely, the worst aspects of the special have nothing to do with Friedlander at all. Rather, they speak to a larger failing within mainstream comedy to craft effective satire of our contemporary political climate, which is more darkly ridiculous than anyone could have expected. \u003ci\u003eAmerica Is The Greatest Country In The United States\u003c/i\u003e’s political commentary may be dead on arrival, but Friedlander remains a unique and valuable voice in comedy.\u003c/p\u003e",

Because everything is perspective. If I’m walking down the street and I see something happen that might spark just a general, wider view on how I feel about things. I always try to get to get to the root of what is going on and what is happening. I always feel like it can relate back to one thing, so I am always trying to figure out what that one thing is.

So it’ll come from a much more compassionate place and I think a much more constructive place than just, you know, pointing out what’s wrong with everything. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a9ce632eddad306ee60bbce75229f58b/tumblr_inline_oy56xgQ4uh1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eI don’t really see a lot of intersection with americana and garage rock, so what aspect of these styles do you see as a point of conjunction that makes your music work?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRG:\u003c/b\u003e I actually really kind of despise americana music, it really just puts me to sleep at this point. I think my old band spent a lot of time in that world and I just don’t even know what it means, but when I think of it I just think of songs that make me glaze over about whiskey and trains and mountaintops that really don’t have anything to do with my life. I feel like I shed a lot of that and I don’t really feel rooted there at all, but I definitely, at least in the past, have pulled a lot from American greats like early rock and roll, and a lot of the best music was sort of pioneered in this country. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3456\" data-orig-height=\"5184\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/40520515c96b7523b54d414ec40d0172/tumblr_inline_oy56zzOf9R1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3456\" data-orig-height=\"5184\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWithin the last few weeks there has been a series of sexual assault charges, many of which are against musicians, and the photographer on tour with you (CJ Harvey) has been pretty active as far as posting about the sexual harassment that exists among the music community. Where do you see the boundaries being between the rawness of experiencing live music and the interactions that come with it, in opposition with the necessity of being conscious and considerate of the space of others?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRG:\u003c/b\u003e I’ve been thinking about this a lot the last few days and it’s a hard thing to really pinpoint because it’s so much about perspective and people’s perception. It’s like something can happen, and one person can take it one way and the other person can be completely unaware and think of it a completely different way. So, really, at the end of the day, I think what everybody lacks is a sort of general sense of awareness and I think we could all be a lot better at that, and that’s not just in regards to this, I think in general it’s just being in the moment and being there and being connected with what everything is all about. There’s not really any room for error there if you’re actually aware of what you’re doing and aware of the point of everything, which is not negativity, is not harassing or assaulting or offending. I always try to look from both perspectives and try to look at everything with some sort of sense of compassion with the belief that no person is inherently evil and that any person can change which I believe to be true based on things I have seen in my life. It’s crazy to see people be ostracized on the internet based on something that may have happened ten years ago, that they didn’t even think anything about. And I’m not justifying any kind of behaviors, but I think what bothers me is when something like that comes out and immediately, for everyone’s own ego, they jump ship. And they don’t want to try to understand what really happened, maybe this person was going through something really terrible at the time, this is not who they are. And then their whole life and career is like - poof. And again that’s not justifying people’s behaviors and I believe that if just everybody, in the world, could just approach everything with a sense of compassion, we can just heal these things and heal these behaviors. It’s the same thing with like the Nazi rallies in Virginia. We can all understand that there’s an illness here. These people are so passionate about hating other people based on things that are not real. It’s dilution to think that there’s any superiority between people based on race - all of this shit is made up - none of its real. So for people to think that it is valid, is a sign of illness to me. So I can compare that to any situation, even the sexual assault allegations. If everybody can look at it like, okay, this person is troubled and they need to be awakened from this unconscious state causing them to act the way that they are. So rather than go out and say “Fuck Nazis, kill Nazis, die racists,” when you think about that, what does that do? How does that allow you to approach these people as human beings to get them to the place that they need to heal to actually solve the problem. All that does is feed the fire, all that does is react with the same thing that they are doing, you just think that it’s on a better side, and we can all agree that there is certainly a better side, a side that is more rooted in reality which is not hatred or assault. But it’s about people going beyond themselves and seeing the humanness in all of us, which creates a universal sense of compassion, it’s not about creating divides. And that’s what freaks me out about this stuff a little bit is that I understand that men are in the wrong here and there are things that happen towards women and there could certainly be a big improvement in that, but let\u0026rsquo;s go beyond ourselves best we can to actually fix it and that always comes from a place of compassion. Somebody has to take that step, because if we just keep responding to the same thing with the same thing, we’re never gonna get anywhere. So that’s a really long answer to it, but I think that’s what it is. I’ll use something very simple. If somebody cuts me off on the highway there are two ways I can respond to it. I can say “What the fuck is wrong with you, you piece of shit?” and honk on my horn, or I could say, “That person is clearly wrapped up in their own head and might be having a day, so I’m just not going to react.” And then there’s just less negativity in the world. And if we can just be mirrors for people and let them see what they are doing, the world can be a better place, but people are just so wrapped up in right or wrong or dividing themselves further. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/79ac9ea18558c91d5a974f5059fb6e3f/tumblr_inline_oy570qNnOA1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eGoing off of that, like you said, there seems to be a tendency to sort of “disown” music when allegations like this come out, but over time they seem to matter less and we take their music back in, such as many have done with artists like Michael Jackson and Tupac. And with situations like PWR BTTM, while people can reject the artists, the music can still hold a lot of meaning to them, so where do you see the separation of artists and their music being? \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRG:\u003c/b\u003e The separation is actually pretty large. Because that’s the thing about it, you can develop a really intimate relationship with music, and you don’t know the person at all. It’s like when you meet your idols you’re nervous because the dynamic is you think you know this person well because you develop a relationship with what they created, but then the disconnect and the weirdness comes from you not knowing actually who they are. So I think those things should remain separate, because when you think about it, a song came from a moment in one person’s life that they happened to channel and they made a song of it. So if anything we are merely channels for creativity. It’s not us building more limbs are we are extensions of the songs we create. Even the songs in \u003ci\u003eHeavy Meta\u003c/i\u003e that we wrote like three and a half years ago - I don’t identify with the person that wrote them anymore. Even John Lennon and some of the people who made some of the greatest music ever, weren’t traditionally the most sound, positive people all of the time. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEven as a solo artist, there is consistency in the members of your band; how do their styles play into the music or affect your process at all?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRG: \u003c/b\u003eWell, what’s cool is I write the songs by myself, guitar and voice, and then when I bring it to Joe and Dylan, it’s like free reign and that’s when I feel like it really becomes a song, when they put their part in. I think they both have very unique ways of approaching it, so that’s kind of why I think we are together, there’s and electricity, an energy, that we convey together. I’ve played with thirty different people over the last few years and when it came time to put together a solid band that was the combo that felt the most [\u003ci\u003emakes grunt of assent\u003c/i\u003e]. There’s some weird magic there, and we are all idiots. We have our own language at this point, we’ve become so alienated at this point because of the way that we talk. We have to hide from the rest of society because it’s nonsensical. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDo you ever dream about them?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRG: \u003c/b\u003eNot a lot, thankfully.

While three of the songs off this four-song EP were released as singles, the EP is cohesive in its dark sound and distinctive Son Lux groove.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs usual, Son Lux manages to take lyrics that would typically be considered untastefully cliche and bring them down to earth and modesty in a shaking falsetto. The vocals and grim themes that made \u003ci\u003eAt War With Walls \u0026amp; Mazes\u003c/i\u003e one of 2008’s best releases are present again in \u003ci\u003eRemedy\u003c/i\u003e, and continue to define the charm in Son Lux’s emotion, even as an electronic-focused group. Often personality in electronic groups are lost, yet Son Lux utilizes both emotive lyrics and clever instrumentation to present poignant concepts, feelings, and themes without ever becoming cliche. Even in lyrics like “Stolen”’s, “May you die wide awake / With a look of great surprise / May your eyes be taken just before you can weep / As you see what you stole stolen from you,” and “Remedy”’s, “Find your voice in the sea of surging bodies and breath,” the listener is never met with a feeling of too much angst. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerhaps this is a quality unique to pop and electronic music, where lyricism is not as strong a focus when presented in a package with strong bass and a catchy beat, but Son Lux succeeds in presenting these lyrics in an admirable light. While the lyrics presented on their own seem too invested in their darkness, they are certainly not buried by instrumentation, and instead, are presented in a perspective where they can be appreciated. Son Lux takes a stance more along the lines of The Cure’s appreciative broodiness, as opposed to the masking of dark lyricism that bands like Crystal Castles hide through harsh synth and noise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to well-presented lyrics, however, Son Lux’s skilled instrumentation is as good as ever. In addition to the typical synthesizer beats utilized by Son Lux, they also incorporate quick violin and flute melodies, as well as choral harmonies under Ryan’s vocals in \u003ci\u003eRemedy\u003c/i\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUltimately, the \u003ci\u003eRemedy\u003c/i\u003e EP presents the characteristic balance between brooding lyrics and danceable synth beats Son Lux is known for. While it may not be their best release to date necessarily, it certainly satisfies Son Lux’s legacy as being a major indie electronic group, and gives hope for future releases and musical growth.\u003c/p\u003e",

Russell Westbrook is a spectacle we can’t turn our eyes from. But Russell Westbrook can kiss winning an NBA Championship in OKC goodbye. And last but not least, Russell Westbrook has great numbers, but it’s all fools gold at the end of the day.\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow before you throw your phone at the wall, knock your computer off the table, and contemplate sending death threats…hear me out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, let me give this man his props. Westbrook is doing things that 98 percent of humans are incapable of. He’s setting this league on fire and sending a message to Kevin Durant that he’s doing fine just without him. He’s playing a jilted lover left at the altar whose determination to get a revenge bod has only made him hotter - and I mean a hotter commodity. As of today he’s averaging 31.2 points, 11.3 assists, and 10.5 rebounds. He’s a fantasy basketball dream come true. We should be thankful that we get to witness this kind of dominance in a league that has become just as compelling in American sports as the No Fun League (NFL.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInstead of tucking tail and signing with a ready made team that didn’t need him like Durant this past summer, Westbrook said the hell with that.  Westbrook doubled down and reiterated that the OKC Thunder was his team and that he was always as suspected, the alpha male on that squad.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut Westbrook and I know a little something that the rest of the basketball fan boys fail to see. Westbrook is going to be a stat machine for the rest of his prime with no jewelry to show for it. Let’s realize there’s nothing wrong with that.  People would kill to be able to play basketball for a living. We’re talking about a childhood game that you can get millions for, including endorsements and fame.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRight now the OKC Thunder have a record of 14-5. They’re the fifth ranked team in the Western Conference, and Westbrook is averaging a triple double later in the season than anyone in NBA history besides Oscar Robertson, the only man ever to average a triple double for a whole NBA season. But we have to dig deeper. The Thunder have only defeated two teams that currently have winning records above .500. It’s still early in the season but if those numbers keep up once the season is over, Westbrook can only take OKC so far in the playoffs without a viable number two scorer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI can see people arguing, “But Westbrook is doing what he has to do.” That is true, but do you think, given the way he dominates the ball, that a top tier free agent will want to go play with him in Oklahoma City? Do you think the Thunder will be bad enough to get a top draft pick in the next few years? The answer is no.  Westbrook’s best chance at a championship is basking in the Golden State Warriors locker room as we speak.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf we were to compare these players, Westbrook is a like a Ferrari in a driveway of an apartment in Pacoima. Durant is a Prius in a driveway of a Beverly Hills condo. I’ll take the latter situation any day of the week. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor now, I’m going to sit back and enjoy the show like everyone else, because we’re watching individual history being made in the NBA. But unfortunately, the NBA is a team sport.\u003c/p\u003e",

There are few other sports that can emphasize an individual like basketball can. The players must play both ends of the floor. The best player is almost always the center of the offense, and can be the crux of the defense too. They can play every game, and can be on the floor for nearly the whole game. For these reasons, if a team is building towards a championship, it is critical to have an elite foundational superstar. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of the best NBA teams have at least one. The Warriors trot out Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant every game. Their shooting and playmaking ability act as cornerstones for the Golden State’s offense. Steve Kerr is able to leverage the gravity that commands to free up the entire offense. If the team is sputtering, one of them has the potential to go supernova and get the warriors back in the game. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Cavs have Lebron James, who exemplifies the need for a superstar. He can impact the game in every way. If his team needs defense, his high flying chase down blocks will provide it. If they need play making, he’ll get into the paint and dish out to shooters. If they need baskets, he’ll take his man to the cup and feast on layups. The Cavs build everything they do around Lebron’s dominance and versatility, giving them an identity and a response to any challenges. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKawhi Leonard from the Spurs provides a two-way impact that is unparalleled in the league. Not only is he the center of their offense, but he defines their defense. His ability to guard everyone but centers impairs the other team\u0026rsquo;s offense. He can latch onto the other team\u0026rsquo;s best player, sucking the life out of them with perfect footwork, hands like black holes, and a keen understanding of angles and timing. He changes the way offenses can play. To have one player who can create that much impact is necessary if your team needs to stop the league’s best offenses. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou’re probably thinking, “Duh, having the best players makes it easier to win.” But there are sacrifices that need to be made to obtain players of this caliber: sacrifices in wins. Some franchises would rather stay in the playoffs then put all their chips into a lottery system designed to reward losing. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter years in the lottery, the Magic have committed themselves to win-now mode. They have lost patience in fishing through high draft picks, looking for a top-tier star. Instead, they have elected to sign a variety of veteran players to try and compliment their collection of young stars. They are throwing shit at a wall and hoping it makes a sandwich. However, their smorgasbord of players has left them without a direction and without an identity. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey currently sit at 6-9, one game out of the eighth seed. However, they are currently 29th in net rating (point differential per 100 possessions.) This is largely due to their last place spot on offensive efficiency. There are many factors that contribute to this, including a lack of spacing and 3 point shooting. They start Elfrid Payton (18.9 percent from three), Aaron Gordon (29.5 percent), and Vucevic (25 percent). Overall, their team shoots 31.9 percent from deep. This severely limits their ability to score (three is more than two), but more importantly, it limits their spacing. The lanes are cramped, so their players have little room to move. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis can be drawn back to their lack of a foundational star. If a team has a core player to build around, then they can surround them with role players. The Magic are forced to have everyone play a role in between role-player and centerpiece. They need to scrounge for talent to try to get some semblance of playmaking, forcing them to neglect the fit of these players with one another. In doing so, they have woefully neglected shooting. If they had a foundational star, then they could surround them with specialists, similar to J.R. Smith’s role next to Lebron. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut they have become impatient. This offseason, they moved away from young talent towards proven veterans. They signed Bismack Biyombo and Jeff Green. They traded young star Victor Oladipo and draft pick Domantas Sabonis for Serge Ibaka. Instead of diving deeper to try to obtain a young star, they moved into win-now mode. In doing so, they capped their ceiling at around a 7-seed and an early playoff exit. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Philadelphia 76ers dove head first into the lottery system. Long time GM Sam Hinkie designed the teams to lose a lot, hoarding draft picks and other assets. They wanted a star, and they knew the best place to get one is at the top of the draft. They refrained from signing free agents, and drafted players with major health problems coming out of college, such as Nerlens Noel and Joel Embiid. Over the past three years, this has resulted in a 19-63, 18-64, and 10-72 records, in order. Pretty awful fan experience. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYet it worked. The Sixers drafted Ben Simmons out of LSU with their number one overall pick this year. A 6’10’’ athlete with the power of a big man and the agility of a guard, Simmons combines positions in a way that is key for success in the current NBA. He has the handle and passing of a high-level point guard, but can rebound (11.8 per game in college) and dominate the paint like a high-level forward. On offense, he could be a hyper-athletic Draymond Green, with his ability to pass in both roles of the pick-and-roll and to run a fast break after grabbing a board. His potential is sky high. However, he is out with a broken foot, and there is no timetable for his return. There is risk of this injury persisting, but the Sixers have shown great patience in rehabbing injured players, as evidenced by Joel Embiid. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter rehabbing various injuries for the first two years of his career, Embiid has come out on a tear this year. He has reportedly grown to about 7’2’’, although he is officially listed at seven feet. A powerful and smooth athlete, he has the ability to protect the rim and switch onto guards. He’s averaging 3.8 blocks per 36 minutes. This rare combined ability is key for defensive success in the modern NBA. He brings a beautiful melody of modern and past center play on offense. A mix of post moves - including a nasty dream shake - allow him to score inside well. His athleticism makes him a dangerous pick-and-roll threat. His shooting stretches defense thin, as shown by his 46.2 percent split from long-range. Embiid is showing just how much a center can do in today\u0026rsquo;s NBA. Him and Karl-Anthony Towns have the highest ceiling of any young big man in the game. That potential alone makes the process worth it. Even more enticing, it looks like Embiid will reach it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\nThe Sixers now have a direction. They have potential All-NBA players to build around. They have the potential for an identity. This structure is invaluable. Trust the process.\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

The band formed when the members were in high school and has received national acclaim from various independent media outlets since the release of their debut album \u003ci\u003eTough Love\u003c/i\u003e in 2014. Forth Wanderers has now returned with \u003ci\u003eSlop\u003c/i\u003e, a four track EP that sticks to their woeful yet dynamic sound filled with adolescent musings and addictive melodies, but with a newfound confidence and self-awareness that was less present in their initial releases.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The EP’s opening track “Know Better” immediately shifts from its lone catchy guitar riff to the rich voice of Trilling. It’s a fitting start, with musings over the band’s central focus: being caught in a space between adolescence and adulthood, knowing you may not be very great at either. The theme follows into the title track. The same simplistic, yet enthralling instrumentals keep in time with Trilling’s soft, forlorn confessions of instability and naivety - “I love too much to hurt this bad / I laugh too much to be this sad.” The third track “Nerves” introduces itself with a gentle guitar riff, followed by lyrics filled with a sense of defeat reserved for our moments of juvenile turmoil. The EP concludes with “Unfold,” a slow-paced song whose slightly optimistic, accepting attitude contrasts the previous track. \u003ci\u003eSlop\u003c/i\u003e ends with a confession of love and reverberations that brings it to a close. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Forth Wanderer’s return to music brings with it not only the angst-filled and poetic troubles of being mature yet naive, but also a fully developed sound that is aware of the message the band hopes to convey. \u003ci\u003eSlop\u003c/i\u003e is hopelessly romantic, justifiably dramatic, and painfully relatable, and that’s what makes it so lovely to listen to.\u003c/p\u003e",

The Brooklyn psych rock outfit returned to the Sunset Strip almost a year to the day after they opened for DIIV on a string of fall tour dates. These days, Sunflower Bean are headlining a national tour and basking in the critical adoration garnered by their debut record for Fat Possum, Human Ceremony. In the relatively intimate space of the Roxy, the audience was palpably transfixed by their unique blend of classic rock bombast and modern indie, listening intently and only starting to move towards the end of the show, when lead guitarist Nick Kivlen hopped off the stage and into the crowd. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1620\" style=\"\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/45ab2b5fd9dcea20ab998229a38fd64f/tumblr_inline_ogghro6LZA1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1620\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe trio have a formidable sound live, managing to give off a more muscular vibe than one might expect from their record. In fact, almost everything about the band is magnified in person. Lead singer and bass guitarist Julia Cummings’ voice is unusually dynamic. In her higher register, she sounds ethereal and detached, and in her lower register, raw and emotive. Guitarist Nick Kivlen occasionally sings too, in a punk-rock tone that matches Cummings’ intensity. They opened with the mid-tempo title track from their album, “Human Ceremony,” which had lyrics that echoed the stage dynamic, with Kivlen interjecting from the other side of the stage, “In your right hand, theres a potion…” Dressed in bell bottoms and a button-up shirt with ruffles, he resembled a young Bob Dylan in person, and played an intricate solo on closing song, “Space Exploration Disaster”. Cummings kept the stage banter to a minimum, but she expressed how grateful they were to be there and also spoke from the heart about her love of Red Bull™, which was brought out on the stage during the performance and thrown into the crowd. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1620\" style=\"\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/76c27c179fc9960426f4435d49e664c9/tumblr_inline_ogghryDLFB1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1620\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe set was comprised mostly of songs from their debut, but “Tame Impala” and “Somebody Call A Doctor” were highlights from their 2015 EP Show Me Your Seven Seasons. For the encore, the band played lead single, “Easier Said”, which has jangly guitar lines and lovelorn lyrics that remind me of the Cranberries in the best way possible. Before leaving the stage, Kivlen reminded the crowd that on the following day, the band would be the first live concert streamed on MTV in over ten years. Sunflower Bean are the perfect example of the reason why live rock music is just as popular as ever. Even if they weren’t breaking new ground, they gave the audience a blissed out break from the real world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1620\" style=\"\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6e314f701aecebb1245d9cf5db1b4166/tumblr_inline_ogghs5Rysu1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1080\" data-orig-width=\"1620\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

The haunted voices which worked in tandem\nwith a minimal house style seemed to change with each track, as if never coming\nfrom a single source.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince \u003ci\u003eSpace Is Only Noise\u003c/i\u003e, Jaar has worked through the use\nof networks and fragmentary bouts of output. He’s worked with Dave Harrington\non the collaborative project Darkside, created a score for the avant-garde,\nSoviet film \u003ci\u003eThe Colour of Pomegranates\u003c/i\u003e, and dropped intermittent tracks\nwhich now assemble the proper \u003ci\u003eNymphs\u003c/i\u003e LP. On top of all this, Jaar’s\nassembled a collective of artists through his label Other People, and debuted \u003ci\u003eSirens\u003c/i\u003e\nthrough their own online radio system with a series of streams to choose from.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, \u003ci\u003eSirens\u003c/i\u003e comes to us through this context of\nnetwork-building, as the third in a series of records after \u003ci\u003ePomegranates\u003c/i\u003e\nand \u003ci\u003eNymphs\u003c/i\u003e. One can see \u003ci\u003eSirens\u003c/i\u003e as a culmination of Jaar’s recent\nreleases, as each becomes increasingly structured and rigorous in terms of\ncraft. Jaar presents 5 wholly fleshed out songs (with the exception of “Leaves”\nwhich works as an ambient interlude), which effortlessly code-switch between\ngenre, language and sonic palette. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Killing Time” bursts with fluid, piano glissandos and breaking\nglass, simultaneously evoking violence and beauty. The song segues into a\ncontemplative exploration of racial prejudice, using the story of Ahmed\nMohamed, who in 2015 was arrested for bringing a self-made clock to school,\nbecause authorities erroneously thought it was a bomb. Jaar presents Ahmed’s\ncreation as an act of self-preservation: “He was just building his own sense of\ntime.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat follows are songs that span genres, dipping into the\nhistories of rock’n’roll, R\u0026amp;B and punk. In “No,” Jaar sings in Spanish over\na lilting reggaeton beat, recalling the 1988 Chilean referendum which asked\ncitizens if US-backed dictator Augusto Pinochet should return to power for the\nnext 8 years. The response was a simple and effective no, from the people to\nthe government.

Rivers and Roads. The acoustic anthem perfectly encapsulates that feeling you get whenever you move on from a place that you call home. I sang my heart out to it driving home from camp last summer which was my last year as a counselor. I played it as the wheels of a plane lifted off the ground in Florence as I left to come back to L.A. after studying abroad there for four months. It’s nostalgic. It pinpoints that pain and inevitable feeling of moving on. I expected this vibe of remembrance and hurting going into The Greek last Friday for The Head and the Heart’s concert, but yet got something completely different.\u003cbr/\u003eThe band has come a long way since their self-titled album and their more recent 2013 album, Let’s Be Still. After the tour for that album, in 2014, the band decided to take a break. Each of the band members went in their own direction. Kenny Hensley (pianist) took kung-fu lessons in China. Chris Zasche (bassist) camped in the Canadian Rockies. Tyler Williams (drummer) lived in Richmond, Virginia to engage in the music scene there. Charity Rose Thielen (vocalist) spent a lot of time writing songs. And main vocalist Jonathan Russell worked with the non-profit Artists for Peace and Justice in Haiti. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey all came back together bursting with different life experiences and thoughts about the world and put together their newest album, Signs of Light which is also the title of the tour. The songs off this album and their words in between songs during the concert clearly demonstrate that they’ve moved on from Rivers and Roads. They are no longer nostalgic, but rather excited about the present moment and where their lives have brought them today. They are fully accepting and relishing in their new lives in a place that may not be their original home, but a place they’ve learned to call home, Los Angeles. Jonathan Russell expressed this in his opening monologue. He said it was so great to be back in Los Angeles which they now consider to be like a “second home” which perfectly lead into their new song “City of Angels”. The lyrics “I know where my heart should be” show that there’s a confidence in their new place. This is very different from their song “Down in the Valley” which lyrics say “California, Oklahoma, and all those places I’ve never been to”.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe concert proved that The Head and the Heart is transitioning from a little indie band to a major record label L.A. group. This could even be seen in Russell’s clothing. The band usually dresses pretty casually, but this evening Russell sported a fancy leather jacket and an ascot, which he thanked the crowd for giving him a pass for wearing. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile the band has moved leaps forward, they still recognized that maybe their audience hasn\u0026rsquo;t been moving as fast to keep up with them. So as the show was coming to a close, people began shouting for the song which I had come to see them for. Russell smiled and coyly said “Fear not Los Angeles, you will have your Rivers and Roads.” And for the last song of the evening, the audience of the Greek sang and cried in unison “rivers and roads, rivers and roads, rivers till I reach you” as the neon sign which read “Signs of Light” glowed on stage, reminding us that you can be nostalgic about the past while being optimistic about the present day.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By\u003c/i\u003e : Chase Madorsky, UCLA Radio Sports (10/11/16)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s go back to January 14, 2012, when something rare occurred in the game of baseball; two teams swapping stud prospects with one another, both trading from areas of strength to try to patch up their weaknesses. Coming off of a rookie year in which he went 9-10 with a 3.74 ERA and 173 strikeouts, (at the time) twenty two year old righty Michael Pineda was traded from the Seattle Mariners to the New York Yankees in exchange for Jesus Montero. Despite questions as to whether or not he would stick at catcher, the twenty one year old Montero had impressed with his short time in the majors in 2011, hitting .328 with four home runs and 28 RBIs in only eighteen games. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Although it seemed to come out of nowhere, the trade made a ton of sense for both teams. At the time, the Yankees were rich in catching depth, with Russell Martin coming off an All Star appearance at the major league level, and Austin Romine waiting in the wings in AAA, and John Ryan Murphy and Gary Sanchez down in the lower levels of the minors as well. However, the rotation had major question marks beyond workhorse ace CC Sabathia following the season, with Freddy Garcia and Bartolo Colon both fighting father time, and with the questions surrounding young and unproved arms in Phil Hughes and Ivan Nova, as well as AJ Burnett’s continued ineffectiveness. Not only would Pineda bring his electric stuff to New York, but it was also thought he would also give the Yankees a righty ace compliment to Sabathia, while also giving them a trio of young and affordable starters (Hughes and Nova) under the age of twenty five to go along with the newly signed Hiroki Kuroda. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009For the Mariners, who finished in last place in their division with 67 wins, the trade was made to give them a much-needed infusion of offense. In the 2011 season, Miguel Olivio led the team with only nineteen home runs, while Ichiro Suzuki led all regulars with a .272 average. And despite only playing in eighteen games, the Mariners front office felt that Montero would give them a true middle of the order presence, one they had been lacking greatly since the days of Brett Boone and Edgar Martinez amongst others. From their standpoint, losing Pineda would be offset by the work of their ace, Felix Hernandez, (Who was only one year removed from winning the AL Cy Young Award) as well as inning eaters Hisashi Iwakuma from Japan, and lefty Jason Vargas. Additionally, much like the Yankees were deep at catcher at the lower levels, the same could be said about the Mariners pitching prospects, with Taijuan Walker, Danny Hultzen, and James Paxton all waiting in the wings. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Over four years, and five MLB seasons have passed since this blockbuster trade, and needless to say, it did not pan out for either team. For the Mariners, Montero had a respectable rookie season in 2012, playing in one hundred thirty five games, and putting up fifteen home runs and sixty two runs batted in, albeit with a low .260 average and .298 on base percentage. However, with Montero only twenty-two, the future still seemed bright. But in reality, 2012 was the peak of Montero’s playing career, as he started the season so poorly in 2013 that he was demoted to AAA after only twenty-nine games, where he not only tore his meniscus, but was also hit with a fifty game suspension for his involvement in the Biogenesis PED scandal. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u00092014 presented the lowest point in Montero’s career, as he showed up to camp weighing 275 pounds, prompting Mariners GM Jack Zduriencik to proclaim he had “zero expectations” for Montero. Spending most of the year in the minors, Montero’s infamy reached a new level when playing through a rehab assignment with the Everett AquaSox, when the Mariners banned Montero from playing the remainder of the 2014 season after he threw an ice cream sandwich at and threatened an AquaSox instructor in the stands. The Mariners again brought up Montero in 2015, with little effect on the field in his thirty-eight games back with the big club; he was released in 2016. Despite being signed by the Blue Jays and being named a AAA All Star in 2016, Montero was again on the wrong side of the news, as he was hit with a second fifty game suspension, this time for testing positive for a banned substance. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Although the Yankees acquired Pineda in January of 2012, he would not make his Pinstripe debut until the 2014 season due to injury. Following Spring Training in 2012, the Yankees placed Pineda on the 15 day disabled list with right shoulder tendinitis, which later led to a labral tear in his right shoulder and season ending surgery in May. All be told, the rehab process lasted until July of 2013, where he was optioned to the Yankees AAA Scranton Wilkes affiliate for the remainder of the season. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009With the anticipation for a now healthy Pineda at an all time high heading into the 2014 season, he delivered, posting a 1.83 ERA in 192⁄3 innings over his first four starts. Yet Pineda’s season would not be without controversy, as on April 23, 2014, in a start against the Boston Red Sox, Pineda was ejected in the second inning after umpires discovered pine tar, a banned substance in the MLB, on his neck. Pineda was suspended ten games, and then later strained his neck, causing him to be absent until August. Despite the controversy, Pineda did finish the year with a 5–5 record and a 1.89 ERA in 76 1⁄3 innings, pitching strong in a small sample size. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The highlight of Pineda’s tenure in Pinstripes game in 2015, when on May 10th he struck out sixteen Orioles with no walks over the course of seven innings. Outside of this one start, Pineda struggled with consistency in 2015 and 2016, as although he made 59 starts across the two seasons, he did so with an 18-22 record, as well as a very high 4.60 ERA and 1.290 WHIP. However, 2016 did find Pineda amongst the AL leader boards, as he finished in the top ten in starts, strikeouts, and strikeout to walk ratio, while also leading the league in strikeouts per nine innings. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Clearly, this trade did not work out as envisioned in 2012 for the Mariners or the Yankees. Yet if we had to pick a winner, it seems we are forced to choose the Yankees, as although Pineda dealt with his own suspension and injuries, he did give the Yankees two and a half season of solid (if unspectacular starts) starts, and despite his maddening inconsistency eventually became an arm the Yankees could give the ball to every five days. On the other hand, Montero only played one full season with the Mariners before flaming out, and in the process dealt with issues over his weight, drug use, and on the field conduct, making fans wonder if Montero was ever all that great, or simply another part of the New York hype machine. When this trade occurred, it was the talk of baseball; yet now, almost five years later, it will go down as one of the ultimate “what if” trades in baseball history had both prospects panned out and played up to their potentials. \u003c/p\u003e",

The group first made headlines when Kylie Jenner released her commercial for her new line of lip glosses using their song \u0026ldquo;3 Strikes,\u0026rdquo; which until today remains their biggest hit. Very little information is known about the band itself except that the group is comprised of the Campa, Felix Snow, and the lead singer Lisa. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe group released their first album on October 22 and it’s deliriously delectable. With auto-tuned vocals that fill every song, \u003ci\u003eBop City\u003c/i\u003e is filled of bright, upset tracks about lust, restlessness, disillusion, and debauchery, with a slight taste of hope. It\u0026rsquo;s the kind of songs you would want to listen to after you’re slightly buzzed or after a long day of school, with its smooth, slippery tunes. \u003ci\u003eBop City\u003c/i\u003e is easy to understand and the perfect soundtrack to listen to when driving. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough my personal favorites are \u0026ldquo;Come First,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Sugar,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;3 Strikes,\u0026rdquo; the remaining five songs keep you hooked and wanting to hit the play button on repeat. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA lot of their appeal is from the mystery of who exactly they are, but their album will seriously make this group huge. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in music that mixes indie electronica with R\u0026amp;B. and has the same vibes as Kiiara. It’s a solid 8/10 on my scale! \u003c/p\u003e",

As complex as it is or needs to be, for a story to work in this format, it must comfortably and sensibly fit into this model.  There are other conventions in filmmaking that we respect because they work.  For example, if you want your audience to sympathize with your protagonist, you beat the shit out of him for most of the first act.  Think the first episode of \u003ci\u003eBreaking Bad\u003c/i\u003e or the first act of \u003ci\u003eThe Bourne Identity\u003c/i\u003e. Very few characters are as stripped of power and masculinity as Walter White, and poor Jason Bourne is literally adrift alone in the cold ocean. There are other practices that are followed because they make narrative or business sense.  Stories are abridged, characters are omitted or added, and narratives that might need two or three hours to tell effectively are shortened to 98 minutes to address short attention spans. None of this is news, and the story of a magical universe set inside of the actual one is bound to be complex.  But in the case of \u003ci\u003eDoctor Strange\u003c/i\u003e, it isn’t, and the film suffers for it.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe story of a genius young neurosurgeon with an ego of Trump-like proportions, Strange begins his journey as a decidedly unlikeable guy. Forced into introspection by tragedy, he wanders the Earth (and other realms) on a quest to be restored and ultimately finds redemption.  It’s the kind of thing that presents almost unlimited opportunity for rich and innovative storytelling. Instead, the one-dimensional take on a decidedly multi-dimensional character ends up making things feel formulaic. There are too many compromises and too much insincerity when the story calls for authenticity. Questions are asked and answered in the same breath, and the viewer doesn’t get a chance to think about what any specific action, word, or event means. It feels canned. Even when Strange experiences a paradigm shift and becomes a somewhat nicer person, it’s hard to buy it. At its heart, \u003ci\u003eDoctor Strange \u003c/i\u003eis the story of a complex man navigating infinitely complex and sensitive situations.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers seem to think we aren’t up to that. Like a packet of saccharin instead of real sugar, they built a world of simple neat story lines instead of something deep, dark, meaty, and satisfying.  It made an interesting story boring, and it kind of hurts to be spoken down to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe visual effects are pretty, but fail to live up to the hoopla. Shortcuts and bows to convention make\u003ci\u003e Doctor Strange\u003c/i\u003e feel like a lot of other films – contrived. Whitewashing one of the most important characters from an Asian man to the talented but decidedly white Tilda Swinton doesn’t help matters.  She does what she can with the role, but her casting is one of those nods to the formula that make the film feel like a color-by-numbers experience. Major transitions happen in the blink of an eye – such as Strange accepting and becoming adept in magic. This is a man who is forced to change his ideas about everything he knows or thought he knew. The problem here is that the transformation happens lickety-split. That happens a lot in this movie. With a run time of just under two hours, an extra 20-30 minutes of screen time dedicated to fleshing out the Doctor’s physical and spiritual journey would have gone a long way towards making things actually feel magical. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s not all bad. \u003ci\u003eDoctor Strange\u003c/i\u003e has a freshness and energy that hasn’t touched Marvel in years (\u003ci\u003eGuardians of the Galaxy\u003c/i\u003e is a lovely exception.) As far as film music goes, the score is exceptional. The cast sparkles with talent and charm.  Of special note are supporting characters Christine and Pangborn, beautifully played by Rachel McAdams and Benjamin Bratt, respectively. Mads Mikkelsen does his thing and knocks it out of the park as the very angry and tragic villain Kaecilius. It would have been great to have a better understanding of what drove him to madness.  But even with the insufficient backstory, he is 100 percent effective as the guy whose appearance makes your blood run cold.  Benedict Cumberbatch has the makings of a star, and it’s easy to see why he was chosen to helm this project.  If he’d been given more to work with, he would have been up to it.  If we had been given more story, we might have been too. \u003c/p\u003e",

A majority of these releases were demos - soft acoustic tracks defined by expressions of love, loss, and memory. However, following the release of Sometimes Even in My Dreams I Am in June of 2013, releases from Infinity Crush came to a halt. During this period, White worked on projects such as Julia Brown, began the ambient duo High Bloom, and, for the past two years, wrote and produced Infinity Crush’s first full-length album with friend Derrick Brandon. That album, Warmth Equation, is a twelve track exploration of various forms of coping with grief. It features the vocals and lyrics of White paired with the subtle guitar of Brandon, along with the keys and vocals of Sam Ray, from Ricky Eat Acid, Julia Brown, and Teen Suicide. \u0009\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWarmth Equation opens with the demo turned full-fledged track “Drowning Here with All My Friends,” a testament to that prolific year of 2013 as well as a display of meticulous and well-thought-out efforts to develop a clean, mature sound. What follows is a combination of ambient reverberations centered on loss and twinkly nods to lovers past and present, all presented by White’s ringing, unearthly voice. Still tracks such as “Spoil” and “Over You” provide more light-hearted pictures of modern romance and unwanted advances, returning back to the sugary-sweetness of White’s final release of 2013. Yet despite the varied atmospheres, the sound always returns to its base elements: simple guitar riffs, dainty vocals, and the refined poetic verses of Caroline White.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe album finishes with “Heaven,” a collective piece largely centered on understanding deep grief through the concept of a flower-filled afterlife, where we can meet again with those we have lost. Its slow pace, soft harmonies, and abrupt stop call back to the previous works of Infinity Crush, combining to represent the culmination of its past scratchy bedroom recordings and its present warm, developed sound.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe entirety of Warmth Equation is a collective of White’s memories of love and loss, along with her ties to her most active year of musical production. She employs the help of friends, along with her own incredible talent in poetry, to submerge us in delicate moments of affection and sorrow on our thirty-minute walk home. She produces tracks of the near spiritual variety, yet always returns us to reality - that is, the inevitability of our passing, and how we learn to cope with it. \u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "This One Time That I Licked a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich, and How That’s Exactly Like The Election Results Right Now",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By : Rohnie Williams, UCLA Radio Comedy Member\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date : 11/11/16\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e So this one time, I licked a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and it’s exactly like the election results. I should explain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I was a wee lad, I loved peanut butter and jelly sandwiches (I was also pretty fond of America). I probably made myself five or 13 sandwiches a day and, let me tell you, I savored every bite. This one time I made the most amazing sandwich ever (I’m talking perfect peanut-to-butter ratio and a smooth continuous spread of jelly) and I was ready to catch a dope ass episode of \u003ci\u003eSpongebob Squarepants\u003c/i\u003e (I was like 7 by the way, I thought I should mention). So, I walk in the TV room of my house, feelin’ myself, and my dad looks over at me and my sandwich and says, “Hey, lemme have some.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt this point a little part of me died. My father, half of a whole unit that worked tirelessly to bring me into this world, was asking something of me, a mere child. My mind began racing, I was trying to figure out how I could keep him from wanting my sandwich, but also not do anything too drastic so I could still enjoy it. So I licked it. Yeah, that’s right, I licked it, and as power began to rush to my head, my father just said, “Wow, that’s sad.” That moment of triumphant history was lost in the recesses of my memory until that fateful Tuesday night when Donald J. (which stands for John and not Jumbo Tron) Trump was chosen to be our country’s 45th president.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo who was the sandwich-licker this time? It wasn’t me, I swear. Well, for starters, it was anyone who voted for Trump. Meanwhile the dads of us are just sitting there without any sandwiches, watching our sons eat a sandwich covered in saliva (that sandwich is America by the way.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"222\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/85502ecc7ad3202418737df0ad0ac78d/tumblr_inline_ogi6biZD431qhakxc_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"400\" data-orig-height=\"222\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow I’m not here to chastise you for your vote, but the fact of the matter is, sandwich licking is actually a group effort. If you voted for Trump, you licked the sandwich. If you voted for Gary Johnson (even if it was some kind of white people protest vote because you feel that Americans need to “wake up” and realize that there are more than just two candidates even though Gary Johnson literally knows less than anybody else on the ballot and is probably the least qualified candidate), you licked the sandwich. If you voted for Jill Stein, you licked the sandwich. And if you were one of the approximately 11,000 people who wrote in “Harambe” or one of the 12 people who wrote in “Hennessy,” even you licked the sandwich. The point is, a vote for anyone (or anything) else other than Hillary Clinton was a vote for Donald Justifies Sexual Assault Trump, and that ruined the outcome for anyone who wanted an America without Trump, I mean, a sandwich without saliva.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow you’re probably looking at your screen like, “Hold up, Rohnie, it’s not that deep.” To that, I say, you’re right - the electoral college, an elected body, chooses the president. Technically, our votes don’t matter. However, with the existence of “swing states” that are not consistently Republican or Democratic, the popular vote in some areas of the United States does matter. That’s all I’m trying to say.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the real, if Hillary won, I’d probably have written an article about how I’m enjoying a saliva covered PB\u0026amp;J. But she didn’t, and however we want to feel about that, I sincerely hope Donald Just Doesn’t Know When To Quit Trump does a great job leading our nation, because it’s not like my dad was like, “I hope that sandwich kills you.”\u003c/p\u003e",

Aside from his influences in music, fashion, art (among\nother things), West is notorious for his live performances and stage\nproductions. His last tour was the Yeezus Tour (in 2013-2014), which included\nballet dancers, a 50-foot tall Mountain, and even “Jesus” himself.  This marks my third time seeing Kanye West\nlive and it is apparent each time why he remains considered one of the greatest\nartists of our time. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9ce0822c5cdc5828012d5f823a0997f5/tumblr_inline_og1qwdhfpQ1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6f3ba50020088a9d9c5f0e36345a91b4/tumblr_inline_og1qx6vK461qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe night starts as I was waiting to gain entry into the\nphoto section.

Without an opener, Kanye\nWest stood on the stage as a slightly altered version of “Father Stretch My\nHands,” began playing.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bf1af31214593f8a7d2ea88eca8dea94/tumblr_inline_og1qz6NaB31qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2fd4f93ac554fe7c7a6a4cec4f7eb611/tumblr_inline_og1qzq6cuE1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe floating stage started moving towards the center of the\narena as the audience below him raised their arms in the air.

If you keep a keen eye to hip-hop, then you would instead see D.R.A.M. as the drunk, sloppy crooner that scored that #1 single, “Broccoli”, alongside Lil Yachty. It’s clear now that Big Baby is both no stranger to success and has found his own flavor. While the flavor is unique, it can be a bit overdone, possibly oversaturated, but it stands slightly above most in the bucket of mimics that the mumble rap genre has produced.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe record kicks off with a kick to disbelief’s face on the track “Get It Myself”; where D.R.A.M. laughably refrains that he had to stop depending on others, or waiting on others, to reach his success. He takes the off the wall sounds of ODB with the off-key hilarity of Biz Markie to sculpt together a feel-good atmosphere on almost all of his tracks. It’s as if D.R.A.M. is not taking himself in the slightest way seriously. “Misunderstood” is a guitar driven banger that sees Young Thug join Big Baby on more serious topics regarding police and self-identity. Despite these sincere undertones on the intro tracks, D.R.A.M. quickly displays quirky, melodic off-key singing and rapping on the tracks “In a Minute/In House” and “Monticello Ave”. They are both songs about personal backgrounds and relationships: “In a Minute” pokes fun at sexual tones as he mutters references to celebrating celibacy by having sex; while “Monticello Ave” is a sincere display of affection to his significant other while on the road. Up to this point, the instrumentation on the record has been bouncy and mixed relatively well (the percussion for a fact has been a bit more dynamic than one might come to expect from hip hop records).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBig Baby sees fit to later clump the singles into the midsection of the record where an avid listener might be most prone to falling asleep. “WiFi”, “Cash Machine”, and “Broccoli” are fun bangers but can feel extremely boxed in and flaccid at around their respective 2/3rd marks. “WiFi” is one of the most underwhelming tracks on the record, with D.R.A.M. attempting to croon over a very polished RnB instrumental and as a result the track feels very disheveled. Fortunately, the same cannot be said for “Cash Machine” and “Broccoli”. These are two tracks that rely heavily on 808 bass hits and straightforward production that provides more than enough freedom for D.R.A.M. and his guest to play with summery references and the typical rap topics of weed, wealth, and women.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s important to note that D.R.A.M. can get away with a lot of things that many other rappers can’t, such as the corny lines on the track “Cute”. He shows a lot of diversity on the tracks that round off the record: “Change My #” and “Password” are all technology-referencing tracks that deal with sour relationships and rocky endings. However, even with the more sappy topics, Big Baby gets away with being sugary, even to the point of being oversaturated. His voice riddles each track with a different emotion displayed in the lyrical content. At the same time, these beats are not too flashy or attention seeking but rather they are fit for D.R.A.M. to doodle over.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe record is then rounded out with a sweetly tinged weed-praising track, “Sweet VA Breeze” and an apparently generic struggle rap song disguised as a pop rap jingle “Workaholic”. The record might not have listeners absolutely begging for new material from the new age Biz Markie anytime soon, but it will for sure be in the back catalog of anybody looking to pop a feel good record during the upcoming winter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e6/10\u003c/p\u003e",

It was already consolation enough that the Manchester-based duo, made up of Dan Wild-Beesly on guitar and John Simm on drums, would be recording and releasing a final album before walking away. When it was announced, several months after I’d gotten my ArcTanGent ticket, that they’d be playing one last show at the festival (a fitting farewell since they had played every ArcTanGent since the festival’s inception in 2013), my already high level of excitement was multiplied tenfold. So while I was still sad that the band was ending, being able to fly from California to England to see their last ever performance was the best possible silver lining. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI spoke with Dan as he was changing his guitar strings in preparation for the band’s last ever gig later that afternoon. We discussed ArcTanGent, the band’s first and last shows, and their process for writing “stupid music”.

It’s always been a 5,000 capacity festival but I think this year they’re very close to have selling it out. The first year, it was still busy but it wasn’t like it is now. It’s got a real community hinged around it. I’m sure you might have already worked that out just being here for a day. \u003cbr/\u003eLayla: Yeah definitely.\u003cbr/\u003eDan: Everyone knows each other, just really friendly and it’s unlike any festival I’ve ever been to, apart from 2000trees which is like a slightly bigger version of this and run by the same people. But yeah, it’s incredible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: Do you have a favorite memory from this year or any year?\u003cbr/\u003eD: The very first year we played was mad because we were a totally unknown entity and we were both super nervous. It was probably by twice the amount the most people we’d ever played to and we were shitting ourselves before we got onstage. There’s one picture John [Simm, drummer] managed to get of the crowd that’s really blurry because he was shaking with nerves. So that was pretty great but I think the 2nd year we were on the same stage, the same stage we’re playing today actually, we did a medley of Rage Against the Machine tunes with Tom [Peters] from Alpha Male Tea Party. It’s the first one we did and it’s become a bit of a tradition. That’s probably my favorite time here so far. Although, every year I’ve had a blast actually. I can’t really tell you what the best year was. I’ll come off stage today and be like “That was the best one, definitely” (Editor’s Note: I spoke with Dan after the show and he confirmed that it had in fact been the best show they’d played) and then if I ever play again in another band I’ll probably say the same again. It’s just the best place to play. Basically our entire fan base comes to ArcTanGent so every time we play we’re playing to everyone that’s ever heard of our band. And everyone’s just really friendly. This is a beautiful place and I love coming here and even if I’m not in a band this time next year I will be here as a human being to watch bands. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: Because this is my first of hopefully many ArcTanGents, do you have any advice for newcomers in your veteran experience?\u003cbr/\u003eD: I suppose I am a veteran. I’d say just go and see all the bands because they don’t book bad bands. From the very first band to the very last band of every day on every stage, they’re all fucking great. If you’re a fan of math rock and anything a bit weird and guitar-based, this is the only place to be. It’s fantastic. So go and see bands, don’t sit in your tent and be an asshole. And talk to people as well. Everyone here is more friendly than almost anywhere else you can go. We don’t have much of a reputation, us Brits, as being friendly but once a year everyone gets together in a field just outside of Bristol and we talk to each other and it’s nice. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: Talking about how many great bands there are, are there any bands you’ve seen so far that have really blown you away or anyone you’re still looking forward to seeing?\u003cbr/\u003eD: I’m really looking forward to seeing Mutoid Man tomorrow. They are so fucking fun and heavy as hell but still quite cheesy in places. They’ve got the balance perfectly right. I saw Three Trapped Tigers yesterday. I’ve seen them tons of times but I’m a massive fan. That was great. We had a little mosh pit and I pretended I was 18 again. Axes were absolutely fucking awesome. We’ve toured with Axes quite a few times and they were exceptional last night. They’re the ultimate festival band. They’re just so much fun and everyone’s dancing and having a wicked time. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: I want to ask you about the term “math rock” because I know there’s a variety of opinions on it. How would you describe it and do you think it’s actually accurate to your music?\u003cbr/\u003eD: Every single style of music needs a title and it annoys me when people get really pissed off about it. You need a name. How are you going to say “I just play widdly guitar stuff, has some weird time changes, very little vocals” which you could say in two syllables if you say “I play in a math rock band”. I wouldn’t say that Cleft is necessarily that much of a math rock band. The only problem I have with the term “math” rock is twofold: One is that I’m shit at math so that just frustrates me and secondly, people when they hear the term “math rock” if they know a bit about it assume that you’re sat there picking time signatures before you’re writing riffs and thinking of melodies and chord structures and writing a song, which is completely the opposite of our writing process. We just jam and then come up with something that makes one of us laugh and then extend that. Quite often, we’ll record something on - we’ve both got those Zoom Handy Recorders which are perfect. Anyone in a band, I’d highly recommend you get a Zoom Recorder and record everything you ever do if you think it’s any good. Then go back to it and you’ll realize that you’ve got more material than you realize. All of our stuff comes from bits and pieces of jams where it’s like, “Oh that little tiny bit, that was good” and quite regularly we won’t come back to it for two years and then “Do you remember that riff we had? I reckon that might sit in well with these chords”. It’s just a really good way of documenting your process and it’s quite easy to amass a load of shit that’s rubbish but eventually you’ll find there was one bit in there that you really liked.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: What bands were you listening to early on in the formation of Cleft that influenced your sound?\u003cbr/\u003eD: One band that I could think of is Faraquet with Devin Ocampo on lead guitar but not playing solos. His playing really changed the way I thought about guitar. My first proper band when I was 16 was a three-guitar band so I was one of three. So my thought process with that was always finding my place in the song and often not playing for half a song or I also played a bit of keys in that band as well. But it was very much knowing my place whereas I started Cleft having heard Faraquet because Devin Ocampo is just the most insanely tasteful but brilliant guitar player. No solos, really. But really nice chords and fast little riffs and mostly not even double-tracked on the recordings. They’re quite stripped back recordings which, again I was very guilty of layering up tons and tons of guitar tracks all the time. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: You announced the band’s breakup back in December and I do want to say I’m very happy that you decided to release another album and do more shows before splitting up. Does it feel weird that this is finally the last show when you guys have been building up to it for a while?\u003cbr/\u003eD: Yeah, I fully agree with you. I’m very glad we decided to do it this way. We sat and had a chat in my kitchen in November last year and we were just saying “I don’t know what it is, but I’m not enjoying being in this band anymore. There’s something that doesn’t have the same kind of buzz that it used to” and we said even before we wrote our first track that if we get to that point, just knock it on the head straight away but not just fizzle out. Actually say goodbye because we’ve done quite a lot together in the last four years. So we didn’t want to do it a disservice to just go, “Alright, we’re done. Cheers.” and not do anything more. And we already had basically an album written and studio time booked. So it’s like, alright let’s do this last album, let’s do a final tour, go back to the places that we’ve played before and just put it to bed properly rather than just letting it die out like a forgotten fart.\u003cbr/\u003eL: That’s an excellent way of putting it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: I know there’s probably going to be some emotions surrounding it but what is something you’re definitely not going to miss about the band?\u003cbr/\u003eD: Ooh, tough question. I won’t miss traveling through Birmingham Town Centre at 3:00 in the morning having been paid about £12 to play a gig to six people on a Sunday evening and then having to get up for work at 9:00 in the morning the next day. I will not miss that.\u003cbr/\u003eL: Yeah, that does sound miserable. \u003cbr/\u003eD: Yeah, it’s pretty shit.\u003cbr/\u003eL: To any people who want to start bands and think it’s glamorous.\u003cbr/\u003eD: Yeah, it’s really not. I won’t miss that but for the majority of the time it’s been awesome. I’ve had a blast and I’ve met most of current best friends through being in this band. Like Tom [Peters] was the best man at my wedding. \u003cbr/\u003eL: Aww wow! That’s nice! And you just met through being in bands?\u003cbr/\u003eD: Yeah. We happened to support [Alpha Male Tea Party] in Manchester at the Bay Horse. Tiny little gig to probably about 10-12 people. Got on really well, they liked my guitar so decided to speak to me and we’ve been best mates ever since. \u003cbr/\u003eL: That’s wonderful.\u003cbr/\u003eD: He’s been sick in my house many times. \u003cbr/\u003eL: That’s the mark of true friendship right there.\u003cbr/\u003eD: Yeah, it really is, like “You can vomit in my house. Mi casa es su casa”. \u003cbr/\u003eL: That’s great. That’s the new thing I need to base all my friendships on.\u003cbr/\u003eD: “Have we vomited in each other’s houses? Well, we’re not proper friends then. Sorry”\u003cbr/\u003eL: Just walk up to someone and ask, “If I vomit at your house tonight, would it be okay” and if they say “no” just walk away. Don’t even bother.\u003cbr/\u003eD: “You’re dead to me”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: So, you guys do have your last ever show tonight. Do you have any surprises or secrets you’re willing to divulge?\u003cbr/\u003eD: We’re gonna be doing what’s become an ArcTanGent tradition for Cleft, a little medley at the end of our set. We’re getting up two guest vocalists from two bands, one being Nick Duke from Trojan Horse and one being Ben Forrester from a band called Bad Grammar, who are no longer together either. But Ben’s also started a new project called Peaks. The medley consists of recently departed musicians’ tunes so it’s got Motörhead, Prince, and two Bowie tunes.\u003cbr/\u003eL: Oh my god. \u003cbr/\u003eD: It’s gonna be pretty emotional.\u003cbr/\u003eL: I might cry.\u003cbr/\u003eD: I think probably a few people will. I’ll probably be there with them, not being able to play anymore. \u003cbr/\u003eL: Yeah, I think the show will end when the entire stage is just a puddle of tears like an electricity hazard.\u003cbr/\u003eD: No one else will ever be able to use that stage again.\u003cbr/\u003eL: That’s how you do it. It’s your last show. Just burn the stage down when you’re done. \u003cbr/\u003eD: “Thank you and good night!” (explosion sound) Release the bees.\u003cbr/\u003eL: That would be the way to end it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"612\" data-orig-height=\"765\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6db34e7d5bc8940cd8f42d5e6ff7c3ae/tumblr_inline_oe2qo6F21O1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"612\" data-orig-height=\"765\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: I want to talk about the new album, although some of the tracks like “Me, Sugar” and “Onan’s Boulder”, those have been around for years now. \u003cbr/\u003eD: Yeah, we did live kind-of demos of those for… last year’s ArcTanGent? No, the year before actually.\u003cbr/\u003eL: I think it was two years ago.\u003cbr/\u003eD: Yeah, thank you. We did that because we hadn’t released anything for a little while and we had those two tunes. And you can’t really call two songs a demo or an EP. We’d been experimenting with live recordings for ages anyway and done quite a few gigs where we’ve kept the audio. In fact, our very first ever gig is on YouTube, like the first two tunes from there anyway. And in fact, oddly enough that very first gig - I’m going to go off on a tangent so you might need to poke me back in the right direction.\u003cbr/\u003eL: No, by all means. It’s ArcTanGent. \u003cbr/\u003eD: There should be lots of tangents at ArcTanGent. \u003cbr/\u003eL: Exactly, we encourage tangents.\u003cbr/\u003eD: So yeah, our very first ever gig was at a venue called the Yorkshire House in Lancaster, where John went to uni. We were supporting a band called Dohnut (formerly known as eating disorder), which is their full name. And I thought “I wonder why they were called Eating Disorder” but they were always called Dohnut (formerly known as eating disorder).\u003cbr/\u003eL: That is brilliant.\u003cbr/\u003eD: Yeah, but their whole shtick is to play to a film that they’ve put together for it. Basically that meant that they have to have a screen in front of a stage for the whole gig. So our first gig, we actually had to play behind a screen. It was very strange. You can’t really get that nervous if you can’t see the crowd. Luckily it was, again, all these stories end with “There’s only 6 people there” so it doesn’t matter anyway. Anyway, I was talking about them because I saw their sticker on a coffee machine at one of the cafes this morning. \u003cbr/\u003eL: That’s funny. \u003cbr/\u003eD: Yeah. What was the question? I think I lost it.\u003cbr/\u003eL: I think it was about you guys recorded two songs but it’s all connected.\u003cbr/\u003eD: Yeah yeah, it’s all connected eventually. I’ll get there. So yeah, we put them out and we felt like we needed to do them properly. It was a really nice way to start an album. We’ve already got two tunes that really we should record properly because we’ve kind of done a bit of a disservice to them by only releasing them as live recordings. So that’s what we did and I’m still pretty chuffed with them. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: Also talking about that, were most of the songs on [Wrong, the new album] part of your backlog or did you record them specifically for the album?\u003cbr/\u003eD: We wrote 80% of the album new. We just happened to have those two tracks already going and we figured we should really do them again. Well, I say new but like I was saying, our process is [to] record lots of live jams, pick it apart, find one good bit and then reconstruct again. So a few of them have been around for a long time but in no actual guise we’ve played in front of people or anything. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: I’ve noticed that when a lot of two-piece bands go into the studio, they tend to overcompensate with lots of overdubs and very heavy production whereas you seem to take the opposite approach. Your albums always sound very live. Is that intentional?\u003cbr/\u003eD: Totally, yeah. Again, going back to Faraquet and Devin Ocampo, all of their tunes especially the earlier ones sound like a band in a room and I’ve always loved that idea. So for this last album we wanted to make it as close to what we sound like in the flesh as possible. But we also decided to go quite far out in terms of budget and studios. Initially the plan was to do a different track per different studio per day all on the trot and do a little documentary about it. But we quickly realized that that was a stupid idea and probably impossible and that, especially if we wanted to play live, it was never going to happen. So we did a version of it, we went to about 5 different studios.\u003cbr/\u003eL: And you posted small videos about each one to get the feel.\u003cbr/\u003eD: Yeah, but it wasn’t this big documentary. I wanted to do a math rock shit version of “Sonic Highways” but it didn’t work out in the end. And I’m still proud of the album. I think it sounds pretty cool. It was a huge effort that we put in. There was loads of driving and it was pretty intense but I think it’s turned out alright.\u003cbr/\u003eL: I think it’s fantastic. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: So, a more technical question. Because you have a pretty elaborate pedal board.\u003cbr/\u003eD: That is true.\u003cbr/\u003eL: When you’re writing, do you have a riff in mind and then see what pedals work with it or do you already have the pedals in mind as you’re writing?\u003cbr/\u003eD: Most of our tunes come out of us dicking about in the practice room so a lot of the time I’ll just be playing on a clean sound but usually with a POG (Polyphonic Octave Generator) on just because it fattens everything up. That’s on 95% of the time, really. But I don’t really think “I’ve got this new pedal, I want to write a song for this pedal”. I’ve tried to do that. Don’t get me wrong, I am a massive nerd. But I’ve generally never gotten anywhere with that. So I just try to write something that I like to dance to or I think is funny or pull a stink face. If I look like I’ve just smelled a big pile of dung, then it must be onto something. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: How do you come up with names for instrumental songs? Because your names are quite… noticeable.\u003cbr/\u003eD: (laughter) That’s very diplomatic. Usually whoever has hold of the recordings, like I’ve said, we record everything very roughly. We’ve got a shared Dropbox folder full of stuff. Well, it’s now actually very organized because John is the most organized person on the planet Earth. It’s incredible. Keep your receipts. But yeah, the names come from whoever puts it up. You can’t have “Untitled 3075” so we just pick a stupid name and if it’s funny enough, it sticks and if it’s not funny enough I’ll think of something else. \u003cbr/\u003eL: Yeah, the stupider the better, really.\u003cbr/\u003eD: Yeah basically. But we try to keep just shy of wacky.\u003cbr/\u003eL: Nice. Because when you’re going wacky then you’re just going too far. \u003cbr/\u003eD: Yeah exactly.\u003cbr/\u003eL: It’s a very fine balance. I don’t think people realize that it’s both an art and a science in naming instrumental tracks.\u003cbr/\u003eD: Absolutely. \u003cbr/\u003eL: It can completely change the entire song.\u003cbr/\u003eD: Totally. Like, I don’t like this anymore. Why do we have to call it “Shit Stick”?\u003cbr/\u003eL: (laughter) Shit Stick is actually the name of my band.\u003cbr/\u003eD: Is it?\u003cbr/\u003eL: It is now.\u003cbr/\u003eD: Shit Stick dot com.\u003cbr/\u003eL: Dot org. \u003cbr/\u003eD: Oh okay, you must be organized.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: You can speak for John on this too, but what’s next for you guys? How can people keep tabs on you?\u003cbr/\u003eD: Well, I’ve already been writing other bits and pieces. John is in general in at least ten bands. We’ve had this discussion and I’m gonna be posting stuff up on the Cleft page if I do something new, which I will because it’s very hard to stop being in bands once you’ve done it for as long as I have. My first band I was 15 and I’m now 31 in two weeks. So it’s been a long time and I don’t know what I would do if I wasn’t in a band, even if it was just a pub-rock band. I have this need and I get very depressed if I’m not playing music so I’ll do it forever or until I physically can’t anymore and then I’ll be really depressed. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: You’ve touched on this earlier. I’m not sure if it’s just me because I have a very strange sense of humor but I feel like there is a lot of humor and not taking itself too seriously within math rock. Do you agree with that?\u003cbr/\u003eD: Oh yeah. I don’t actually like that many bands that take themselves seriously. It might be something to do with mainly enjoying instrumental music where you can’t say “Oh, this song is about so and so” if there’s no lyrics. You can try and impart some kind of emotional feeling but ultimately we’re just two dickheads that like doing stupid music and other people seem to like that so that’s fine. Well that’s not fine, it’s fucking brilliant actually.\u003cbr/\u003eL: It’s certainly convenient if nothing else. \u003cbr/\u003eD: Oh, it’s great! We’re still shocked when people are really big fans of ours. Like, are you sure? You haven’t got a different Cleft in mind, have you?\u003cbr/\u003eL: Like those crazy people who’ll come all the way from California.\u003cbr/\u003eD: Yeah, exactly. I mean, who the fuck would do that?\u003cbr/\u003eL: It’s weird.\u003cbr/\u003eD: That’s a mad thing to do. \u003cbr/\u003eL: Very strange. Might be a little bit disturbed. \u003cbr/\u003eD: (laughter) Aren’t we all?\u003cbr/\u003eL: I think that’s why everyone’s here. We’ve all just wandered here in a daze.\u003cbr/\u003eD: Exactly. We’re all on the same page at this festival and that’s one of the nicest things about the festival in itself is everyone’s a bit weird. You can just do whatever you want, like “Hey! We’re all the same, aren’t we?”\u003cbr/\u003eL: That’s very true.\u003c/p\u003e",

It was the UK-by-way-of-Blompton-based band’s first show since the release of their third studio album, Disappointment Island on July 8th. The album also marked their second release as a trio, with the departure of two members and the addition of Henry Tremain to brothers Tim and Chris Collis in 2011. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe night began with Bay Area natives Covet, an immensely talented trio that in their short tenure has already produced a standout EP which successfully fuses impeccable math technique with rich atmospheric soundscapes. Unlike many bands whose complexly layered studio recordings can’t help but fall flat when placed in a live setting, Covet’s performance somehow managed to heighten the listening experience, especially during more dramatic tunes like “Sea Dragon”.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTaking the stage at just past 11:30, it only took a couple of seconds into “Sponkulus Nodge” for TTNG to prove what many had previously suspected: It’s not easy to dance to songs in 14.5 meter. That said, this crowd was certainly up to the challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough it may not have been the band’s original intention when first forming in 2004, the current lineup is one of the strongest live power trios I’ve come across in recent years. Individually, each part seems infinitely intricate and precise yet when played together they meld seamlessly as a singular cohesive piece of music. While Tim Collis’ flowing ornamented guitar lines carry the songs beyond the territory of conventional counting methods, Henry Tremain’s bass playing is the counterweight with decisive rhythm and punches of melodic counterpoint. Paired with his bright vocals and falsetto, Tremain’s custom Squier 6-string bass is an excellent anchor for the trio’s low end. His style is as unique as the instrument itself, refusing to conform to the standard roles of a baritone guitar or a 4-string bass. At the core of every song is Chris Collis’ asymmetrical yet organic drumming, which serves as the thread that ties all the other musical elements together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was this strength as a trio that made for such an interesting dynamic when the band was joined onstage by their tour manager and fellow Sargent House labelmate Henry Kohen, who is best known for making his own brand of one-man math rock under the name Mylets. Being a longtime friend of the band and having contributed bass to a track on the new album, Kohen’s presence onstage seemed effortless as the two Henrys split bass and rhythm guitar duties throughout the night.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTTNG’s dedication to their fans was evidenced in how they constructed their setlist. With this being their 5th visit to San Francisco since the release of their previous album in 2013, it was clear that they were making an effort to keep their shows fresh and exciting. In addition to playing several tracks off their new album, the band also reached deep into their back catalog with songs like “Want to Come Back to My Room and Listen to Some Belle and Sebastian” off of their 2008 self-titled EP. Their set was also littered with fan favorites such as “Gibbon” off the band’s first album Animals, which had every member of the audience singing along in a raucous chorus, as well as the live debut of their virtuosic jam “+3 Awesomeness Repels Water”.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany years ago, this band was my inauguration into the world of math rock and no matter how deeply I explore the genre I still feel that their execution of the style is one of the purest I’ve ever heard. Their songs are highly technical and precise without ever feeling mechanical. Their newest album demonstrates their ongoing commitment to pushing rhythmic and harmonic boundaries without slipping into self-indulgence. Each instrumental line\u003cb\u003e \u003c/b\u003ehas its own complexities, just as each musician has their own personality, yet they still come together in a way where no instrument overshadows or detracts from another. Listening to a TTNG album, you can hit replay as many times as you’d like to try and soak up every last note. But when experiencing them in a live setting, one can do nothing more than smile, nod along and enjoy the ride.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten By: James Shippy, UCLA Radio Sports\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date: 12/11/16\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s face it.  Everyone’s thinking about it but no one is really saying it out loud.  After Peyton Manning retired there was a huge void left in the NFL, a yearly void of who to compare to the great Tom Brady.  Even Tom Brady’s biggest critics and naysayers historically have to admit he’s likely the greatest quarterback of all time…besides anyone who grew up in the Joe Montana era.  But something special happened late April 2016 in the fourth round of the NFL draft.  That something special was Dak Prescott, who received the biggest gift of all: the Dallas Cowboys drafting him.  Prescott has set the league on fire from day one and he’s showing no signs of stopping. As far as rookie seasons, Prescott is out-Tom-Bradying Tom Brady.  This is not a hyperbole and this is not being a creature of the moment, as majority of sports fans are.  Through Prescott’s first foray into the NFL, in 11 games he has completed 18 touchdowns to only two interceptions.  In Brady’s 2001 rookie season he had 16 touchdowns to 9 interceptions. Prescott has completed 231 out of 340 passes (67.9 percent.) Brady completed 212 out of 320 passes (66.2 percent.) The Patriots had the sixth ranked offense and the fifth ranked points per game defense in the league that year. Dallas has the fifth ranked offense and the twenty-first ranked defense so far this year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe stats are strikingly the same.  But I don’t want to just focus on numbers, even though numbers never lie.  I want to focus on fate and poise.  Fate would have it that back in 2001 there were six quarterbacks drafted before Brady, including the likes of Chad Pennington and a guy named Giovanni Carmazzi from Hofstra.  Sorry Giovanni.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrescott had the likes of Cody Kessler and Jared Goff drafted ahead of him.  Now it’s way too early to determine what kind of careers these players are going to have, but it’s not too early to assume that the NFL is unlikely to have multiple Hall of Fame talents in the same draft class at the same position.  (That is, unless you’re talking about the 1983 draft with players like John Elway and Jim Kelly - but back then, Mario Bros the arcade game and McNuggets being sold nationwide just went into effect, so it was a very long time ago.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost importantly is the poise factor.  Numerous quarterbacks have arm and foot talent, but numerous quarterbacks don’t have what it takes in the space between the ears to relieve an all time quarterback due to injury - Brady to Drew Bledsoe, and now Prescott to Tony Romo.  Not only did they relieve them, but they set the league on fire and make it look so damn easy.  So instead of us trying to complain that the press is engaging in some love fest for the new “it” guy on America’s team.  It’s time we bask in the birth of a new star, no pun intended.  Because once Brady retires, the league is going to be in good hands with our new crop of quarterbacks dazzling fans every Sunday.  And Prescott can be added to that list.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Text, Image, Movement, Sound: Akhnaten at the LA Opera Reviewed",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten by: Aaron Peretz, UCLA Radio Digital Press\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date: 12/4/16\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI had the pleasure of seeing Philip Glass’s third installment of his portrait trilogy, \u003ci\u003eAkhnaten\u003c/i\u003e, at the LA Opera the other night. Visitors of this showing lucked out, as Mr. Glass himself came to discuss with the conductor-in-residency Matthew Aucoin before the show. At one point in their conversation, the master composer noted that he’s enjoyed his tenured foray into movie collaborations because it shares the same elements that the opera/theater does: text, image, movement, and sound. With that, I’ll proceed to review this opera by Mr. Glass’s own standards\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eText\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis opera is the final installment of Glass’s portrait trilogy focused on individuals who changed the sociological plenum. The first two operas in the series \u003ci\u003eEinstein on the Beach\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eSatyagraha \u003c/i\u003esee the role of man’s other institutional artifacts in shaping our world. The former is concerned with the Copernican Revolution following Einstein, while the latter’s lens looks to the pacifistic political revolt of Gandhi. This third story has as its subject the pharaoh Akhnaten who is historically cited as introducing monotheism to the West, because of his transition of the Egyptian civilization away from its predating polytheism. The story follows Akhnaten’s ascension to his decline. We see his move from Thebes to Amarna, a city dedicated to him by the monotheistic god Aten. After decades of self-imposed isolation, the people overtake the royal palace and killAkhnaten. He is replaced by his alleged son, the future pharaoh Tutankhamen who reinstates polytheism. In the pre-show discussion Glass alluded to his (and modern theater’s) indebtedness to the absurdist Beckett. In true absurdist style the opera cycles. The ostentatious Akhnaten is replaced by another demigod. Like a modernist film, the mechanisms of the artwork are revealed to the viewer. The story ends with a scene framed around a university lecture on the legacy of Akhnaten. Although spaced millennia apart, Akhnaten’s story ripples today: the ruling class’s self-indulging disregard for the populace, the people’s willingness to be controlled, and history’s ability to deify the human narrative.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eImage\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately for Glass, the art direction failed to live up to the music. Glass admits that his creative process permits little-to-no coordination with the other artists involved in any of his operas. That was evident for this performance. It didn’t share the informed contrast of Robert Wilson’s art direction for \u003ci\u003eEinstein on the Beach\u003c/i\u003e. Instead, \u003ci\u003eAkhnaten\u003c/i\u003e, directed by the English Phelim McDermott, was gaudy and unchecked. If there was any precision, it was obfuscated bythe steampunk cum ancient Egypt aesthetic and the Liberace approved flamboyancy of the costuming. The opera was largely devoid of irony, except the continued submission of the populace, i.e. repetition of history. But this presence of irony wasn’t reinforced by the stylistic choices at all. The outfits flaunted lapis lazuli and gold hues (and then some) reminiscent of the precious materials of the ancients. But the rhinestone bedazzled vestments added all the tackiness of the two-thousand-and-aughts without any of the fun. The stage lighting was excessively warm. Aten, the declared god of Akhnaten, is a sun god, but yellow-tinge only emphasized a steampunk grittiness and not a royal wash. The other motivation in the warm stage lighting was perhaps the framing of a historical picture because we have collectively decided that sepia tones symbolize old-times. The text would have been better served if the tropes were replaced by sincere form.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMovement\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough hard to parse from the image, I think the movement aspect of the opera better illuminated the text than the aesthetics of the lighting, costuming, etc. The opera is sung in ancient languages (ancient Hebrew, Akkadian) taken from primary sources of sorts. Interpolated between the story is a narrator speaking in a modern language. A pre-show email from the LA Opera informed audiences that there’d be no subtitles overhead for \u003ci\u003eAkhnaten\u003c/i\u003e. For the classical operas of Italian and German, English subtitles are always present. But this deliberateness not to provide translations of the dead languages made the audience dependent on a narrator, just as the ruled classes were dependent on a translator of the royal authorities. This narrator later played the role of the professor who serves as mediator of past and present to his students and to the audience. The opera tells us how history becomes deified. We look to it to for the same reason we look to any higher authority—we ask what our fates can be. The positing of an ineffable (nonexistent?) God leaves vacancy for mortals to dominate other mortals with the promise of fortune-telling. Akhnaten’s turning his back left the mass in a state of indetermination. Uncomfortable with this position, the masses revolted to reinstate hierarchy, their own domination.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSound\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGlass’s layered minimalism is sheer profundity. The boisterous visual aesthetic didn’t cooperate with the understated eidos of the music. The ineffable insight of the immortal fails when translated into the natural language, but can only be uncovered by the music.\u003c/p\u003e",

Accordingly, I didn’t fully consider just how loud their live performance would be, or how much screaming would be involved. Tickets to the show sold out in just over an hour, and I mourned for weeks that I hadn’t gotten tickets before miraculously getting my hands on a press pass. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs soon as Will Toledo walked on stage, soon joined by the rest of the band, I could feel the energy in the room rising. After acknowledging the recent presidential election and citing the death of Leonard Cohen this week, as well as the year’s earlier loss of David Bowie, the band opened with covers of Cohen’s “Field Commander Cohen” and Bowie’s “Five Years” to start the show. All four members of the band were giving it their all, evidenced by the blasting guitars and drums radiating over the crowd. But the moment I knew we were in for a great ride was when we heard the opening notes of “Fill in the Blank,” the first track from CSH’s highly-anticipated Teens of Denial album, which came out earlier this year. After a roar of approving applause and cheers, the crowd began singing along: “I’m so sick of… (fill in the blank)\u0026hellip;” As the instruments all briefly cut out for the start of the chorus, the crowd started to not just sing but scream along with the chorus: “‘You have no right to be depressed!’ ‘You haven’t tried hard enough to like it’\u0026hellip; it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts…” Although the band’s faces remained stoic, the crowd’s energy built throughout the set to match the intensity of the music pouring off the stage. The crowd continued alternatively singing and screaming along, even to some of the band’s older songs. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe show, of course, was incredible. It was almost hard to believe that such a strong musical performance was coming from this relatively calm-looking group of musicians. Unlike performers who throw their whole bodies into their act, the band’s faces reflected a placid state of concentration. Will, the poster child of CSH, barely moved for most of the show, besides picking up and putting down his guitar. The ultimate of art boys, he was clad in a gray dress shirt, shiny black dress shoes, and a dark tie and jacket as if he had just escaped from some oppressive prep school. I wondered how he was able to play without sweating through all those clothes. Nonetheless, his vocals were surprisingly powerful, to say nothing of the frequent screaming that broke through sporadically. The band’s outward low-energy stage presence, contrasted with the intensity of their performance, seemed to represent something often reflected in their lyrics: you might look calm on the outside, but inside you can still be filled with rage, power, and pain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"980\" data-orig-height=\"654\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f77bb43fbef284516ce55dd716f55c7e/tumblr_inline_ohh6zpREgZ1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"980\" data-orig-height=\"654\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePictured above: UCLA Radio interns before having their minds completely blown by Car Seat Headrest\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter an impressive hour-long set that went by in what seemed like a few moments, Will stepped to the mic and announced, “We were going to end this with a sad song, but I don’t want to do that anymore ‘cause I’m actually feeling pretty good right now.” We saw his elusive smile for maybe the first time as he turned to his bandmates and they banged out “Destroyed by Hippie Powers” to close out the set. Then they disappeared off stage, and the crowd screamed for an encore like our lives depended on it. After an excruciating minute or two that almost made us believe that the walk-off was for real, they re-emerged and told us they hadn’t been able to decide between “the sad encore” or “the happy encore,” so they would do both. The sad factors were obvious, but “the happy thing is that life goes on, and we still go to rock shows, and we still fall in love and all the other good shit,” Will told us. The band played two more songs. I didn’t want it to end and neither did anybody else.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt would do no good to try to further put into words exactly how the show was or how euphoric it was to be among all the other angsty people dancing, jumping, and singing along as we dumped our hearts all over the Teragram Ballroom. There were no hecklers, there was no moshing, only people reacting in earnest to music that really touched them. After the show I spent fully 24 hours thinking about how perfect it all was and hearing in my mind the echo of the crowd. I’m not one for concert videos, but I combed YouTube for a live recording of “Fill In the Blank,” and no one was singing along in any of them. Red Bull Sound Select, if you’re reading, please release live footage of Day 13 so we can see a band and a concert crowd together at their finest. For now, I’ll be clinging to the memories and waiting for the next tour.\u003c/p\u003e",

The small floor space is packed, and people are pressed against the stage, laughing at the bar, and leaning over the balcony. The two openers have left everyone restless. Local alternative rock band Future Feats animated the crowd with their boyish energy and excitement, as an opener whose music sounds much better live because of the pure enjoyment they emulate during their performance. Clean Spill had continued with their slurred, angsty vocals against surf rock streaked guitar and steady drums. While the crowd a little slow to catch onto the mood after the more mainstream energy of Future Feats, by the end many were moving and cheering, and even managed to form a small pit by the last song. Now buzzing with anticipation, fans peek up every once and awhile at the glass booth on the upper level, where Day Wave and his touring band are waiting to take to stage. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/bd1db7801aba74697005079589cf2519/tumblr_inline_ogadj2esUF1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7baaae60da09b6fd0ed60b6380eb0973/tumblr_inline_ogade1tFq81qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4a8daa4af2c62c29bf63dded736692d9/tumblr_inline_ogade7jAMA1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s an impressive sight for a musician who, just a little over a year ago, was playing only small local gigs in the Bay Area. I’d first met Day Wave when they were performing at happy hour in the quad of Phoenix Hotel in San Francisco, with a modest crowd made up mostly of patrons enjoying a cocktail by the pool. Back then they were getting paid in free booze and hotel rooms, and they were fun - talking to them after their set, they were energetic, excited, and just a bit cocky. In the subsequent months they’ve burst onto the indie music scene, performing in Europe, Australia, and across the United States at festivals like Lollapalooza and Treasure Island. Yet after seeing their features on Noisey and Urban Outfitters, the washed out pastel portraits of Jackson Phillips, the musician behind Day Wave, and the EPs released on limited edition pink vinyl, part of me became worried that what was really propelling the band was its ability to fit inside the current alternative aesthetic. Indeed, when I had investigated their merch table earlier that night I found minimalist white pocket tees and stacks of dreamy polaroids taken by one of the touring musicians during their previous tour. Sifting through the photos, I wondered if the band’s selling point that night was their music, or their look. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3071\" data-orig-width=\"4373\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/97392ddab8bea24e751ad448724cfe42/tumblr_inline_ogadi9h2M11qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3071\" data-orig-width=\"4373\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3212\" data-orig-width=\"4831\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/dbcd34e8f0d815cd581e270483dfb00e/tumblr_inline_ogadgnYpmr1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3212\" data-orig-width=\"4831\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ce01ace6b30aae027817f55742a871ad/tumblr_inline_ogadgxzmQB1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor a brief moment, as Phillips stepped out on stage in black jeans, white high top Converse, and an appropriately ironic D.A.R.E. t-shirt, my fears seemed to be confirmed. Yet the minute the group launched into their new single “Wasting Time,” I experienced a complete reversal of all I had expected. The band’s live performance chose to favor their rock influence over the more dreamy electronic aspects of the music, while still keeping the perfect hint of synth and slightly ethereal delivery. The musicians forwent the indie stereotype of barely moving on stage with eyes closed and instead moved around to jam out together, bending low over their instruments, and keeping spirits high. The first song, one of Day Wave’s more upbeat and breezy releases, set a perfect tone for the night. The set was nearly entirely music, with very brief interludes of Phillips thanking the crowd, and almost bashfully admitting the band wasn’t used to performing for such a sizeable group of people. The arrangement of the venue, with the floor pushed close up to the low stage, also created a shared atmosphere between the performers and attendees, and helped immensely with both groups trading excitement and good vibes. The crowd bounced and swayed along as Day Wave played tracks from EP’s Headcase and Hard to Read. “Deadbeat Girl” especially brought cheers as the familiar synth and upbeat guitar led into Phillip’s whimsical vocals. Even when the band brought down the tempo with quieter, daydreamy “You,” Phillips smiled softly, bringing a sweet nostalgia to his lyrics, “I don’t know how to feel about you,” in one of the best songs of the night. The performance concluded with a masterful three piece ending, starting with the band’s stellar cover of “Ceremony.” Much of Day Wave’s music is already influenced by New Order, making the rendition a good fit within the set. When they flowed into their most popular track, “Drag,” no one could help but to sing along. Finally, after the band promised to come back to LA soon, the night concluded with a raucous version of one of Day Wave’s first songs, “We Try But We Don’t Fit In,” which had the crowd shouting and even head banging as the band applied a garage band energy and rowdiness to their sound. After the set, Phillips and the touring members hung around the floor, talking and drinking with the crowd in a comfortable sense of familiarity and casualness. When I asked one of the musicians how things had changed since the Phoenix back last summer, he shrugged and said it wasn’t that much different. And I believed him. When it came down to the question of whether Day Wave would become neatly packaged within their pastel polaroids, their performance showed they most certainly didn’t. They hadn’t even really been there in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3026\" data-orig-width=\"4890\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1d7569eb249302af5ee3ceb07dc7313f/tumblr_inline_ogadhuM1DN1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3026\" data-orig-width=\"4890\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"2859\" data-orig-width=\"4288\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/90dac6596f6f9b27fb976d203861565b/tumblr_inline_ogadk6qS4x1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"2859\" data-orig-width=\"4288\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ac12954824c2e812dcffba6f58c099b4/tumblr_inline_ogadi0DuGh1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" data-orig-width=\"5184\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

And the inner-resolution of maybe never finding that understanding. The album’s 10 poly-fi recordings are a collection of sacred moments, love’s torment and salvation, contexts of intense memories, signs that you can pin meaning onto or disregard as coincidence. If Bon Iver, Bon Iver built a habitat rooted in physical spaces, then 22, A Million is the letting go of that attachment to a place.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is music that is beautiful because it reminds us of something else, for example when The Killers evoke New Wave nostalgia or how Adele never lets us forget the beauty of a classic piano ballad. And then there is music that is beautiful because it feels so different and innovative it reminds us of nothing else. Bon Iver’s newest album, 22, A Million, falls into the latter category.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this album, Bon Iver experiments sonically with computer-affected vocals and arrangements, as well as instruments such as the saxophone that not typically used by this indie folk, Wisconsin-based band. However, despite being a distinct departure from previous bodies of work, 22, A Million still maintains an innate yet intangible “Bon Iver” quality to its sound, which I can only describe as a clarity of emotional expression so embedded into the heart of Bon Iver’s music that it feels not only deeply personal, but also vulnerable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat separates 22, A Million from past albums is that before, this, for lack of a more apt name, “Bon Iver” quality was firmly anchored in the music’s connection to physical places. The very titles of songs from Bon Iver and For Emma, Forever Ago are largely names of places such as “Perth” or “Lisbon, OH.” In 22, A Million, the “Bon Iver” quality disconnects from physical places, which is reflected both in the lyrics and the disembodied, slightly electronically altered sounds of the album. The song “33 “God”” states plainly, “These will just be places to me now,” concisely summarizing the shift from expressing oneself through physical locations to suspending freely in a more ethereal understanding of existence in the world. Like the unfamiliar yet intimate musical sounds of 22, A Million, the lyrics of the album depart from attaching emotional significance to places and transcend onto a level of self-understanding and emotional reflection that is beyond one’s immediate physical surroundings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy only criticism for 22, A Million is a superficial one. I think the song titles needlessly use excessive symbols and letter capitalization. Because of this, it becomes inconvenient to reference the specific song titles in verbal conversation (“Hey what do you think about 715 – CRΣΣKS? You know what my favorite track is? ____45_____”), which is a shame because I want to talk about the album with people! However, I am willing to concede that perhaps this is an artistic choice singer-songwriter Justin Vernon makes for reasons that go over my uncreative head.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFavorite tracks of the album: 29 #Strafford APTS and 715 – CRΣΣKS\u003c/p\u003e",

He’s a hydrologist, not just a dad. But also my friend! He brought me a stalk of rapini (aka broccoli rabe) as a thank you present.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eDJ CENTRIFUGE: That was definitely a memorable show. We pushed the boundary of what a theme could be, but were surprised at how much music we found that fit in. We also got to talk about a pressing issue and be uncharacteristically serious, offering our listeners an educated perspective on something other than our great tastes in music.

But seriously, we try to keep a balance between our personalities and our responsibilities as DJs— sharing our favorite music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJ CENTRIFUGE: Viva UCLA Radio!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eSPINACH BOI: Stop.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eDJ CENTRIFUGE: Our main goal is to translate our enthusiasm and excitement about the songs we’re playing to the audience.

Our weekly theme determines what direction we’ll go, so inspiration for it is potentially more important than for specific songs. We might notice common elements in songs we’re currently listening to (written in second person, featuring other artists, etc) and translate these to themes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eSPINACH BOI: We also sometimes draw inspiration from what’s going on around us/in the world that week for our weekly themes! One week, it was DJ Centrifuge’s birthday, so we made our theme essentially be some of her favorite songs. As DJ Centrifuge said above, we do try to stick to the theme and concept of our show but sometimes we can’t help but play our current favs and find a way to fit them in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"720\" data-orig-height=\"516\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e1e8b755562be347df7f41f6e1800015/tumblr_inline_oet20xk4N51qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"720\" data-orig-height=\"516\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eHow did you come up with idea for your show?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJ CENTRIFUGE: In each episode of Opposites Attract, we connect each song to the next one by either a close similarity or stark difference, creating a cohesive chain. If Spinach Boi picks a simple song with only vocals and guitar, I might lead us in a completely new direction with something loud, complex, and chaotic. We’ve got to give credit here, though, to the original creator of Opposites Attract: the wickedly talented, one and only Annie Rimmon. She was in fact a co-DJ on our show’s very first season, in the spring of 2015.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eSPINACH BOI: It was so fun having our show with Annie, but she had to leave to study abroad so we took the show over! Since then, we’ve made the show more music-centric, and have cultivated a representative sound focused on more specific genres than before. We also have themes now, to spice things up! Take a load of that, Annie! Just kidding.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow would you describe the dynamic between you two DJ’s?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSPINACH BOI: Well, we live together now, have been seeing concerts together for at least a year, and recently have been trying to learn songs together on guitar (recently = one hour ago)— so, it really just seems like an extension of our everyday lives, just with weird microphones in our faces! Of course we love to make fun of each other and be goofy as heck, but we also love keeping our show professional and putting our listeners first.\u003cbr/\u003eDJ CENTRIFUGE: He’s right! Although we’re comfortable with each other and maintain a jovial atmosphere on-air, we make a big effort to focus on the music. The show has been an awesome way for me to learn details and histories about artists I love. We do like to talk about our friendship on the show, and recently introduced a new segment called Opposites Attract: Friends Edition, in which we discuss similarities and differences between the two of us. There is a questionably larger proportion of the latter, but we agree that Quiznos \u0026gt; Subway and that the artisan sandwich place in North Campus Student Union is by far the best on campus.\u003cbr/\u003eSPINACH BOI: We just really like sandwiches.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"719\" data-orig-height=\"500\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7a5643732339fdd5c71d6240c04d750d/tumblr_inline_oet21oK7mP1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"719\" data-orig-height=\"500\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

Maybe that’s why it felt so fitting for them to be one of the first bands I saw at my first ArcTanGent. Last time I saw the trio, it was their first show following the release of their third album, Disappointment Island. \u003ca href=\"http://uclaradio.tumblr.com/post/148114631247/show-review-ttng-thee-parkside-san-francisco\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e(You can read a review of the show here\u003c/a\u003e.) This time around, they had toured the album all across the United States and as a result, many of the tracks definitely felt more settled. It was also clear that the fans had fully embraced the new album as well. From an audience perspective, it was perhaps the most electrifying set I’ve seen them play and it really set the tone for the whole festival and all the exciting bands I’d be witnessing over the next three days. I sat down with guitarist Tim Collis and drummer Chris Collis to discuss the band’s evolution, their new album, and geekiness in the math rock scene.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAugust 19, 2016 - Fernhill Farm, Bristol, UK\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLayla: This is your third time playing ArcTanGent. How do you think the festival has grown since the first time you played it?\u003cbr/\u003eTim: There’s a few more people. It seemed pretty popular the first year but I guess they’ve sold more tickets since the years have gone on. \u003cbr/\u003eChris: Yeah, it’s cool that the kind of lineups are obviously changing. I mean, they still have bands back on the Thursday but they seem to get really big popular acts that haven’t played before as well. So I hope they keep finding enough bands to keep it interesting, which they seem to be doing at the moment. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: Do you have a favorite memory from ArcTanGent, either from this year or any of the previous years?\u003cbr/\u003eC: I think playing last night was probably the highlight of all of them. That was awesome.\u003cbr/\u003eT: I like the first year but purely for the weather because it was really sunny. That was nice for that reason but yeah as Chris said, this one was pretty cool performance-wise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: This is my first year [at ArcTanGent] so do you guys have any advice for a first-timer? How to navigate or any do’s or don’ts?\u003cbr/\u003eT: Don’t camp (laughter)\u003cbr/\u003eC: Bring a jacket. We’re pretty wussy when it comes to camping because we don’t live too far so we tend to drive home and come back. But we might camp tonight. It’s pretty fun so we’ll see.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: Have you guys been seeing a lot of the other bands around? Are there any who’ve surprised you or any you really enjoyed?\u003cbr/\u003eC: I watched Three Trapped Tigers. They’re awesome so I always like watching them. I look forward to seeing toe, obviously. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: What bands were you listening to when you first started this band and were trying to figure out your sound?\u003cbr/\u003eC: (to Tim) Well you first started it, didn’t you?\u003cbr/\u003eT: I guess when the band first started it sounded really different. It sounded more like Biffy Clyro’s early stuff and I was listening to bands like Incubus. So this was a long time ago. It didn’t actually sound anything like it does now. It was completely different. \u003cbr/\u003eC: I think American Football, Owls, Make Believe were quite influential in the movement towards mathy indie stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: Henry [Tremain, bassist and vocalist] isn’t here so I can’t ask him about vocals, but as a band that has a vocalist when a lot of math rock bands are instrumental, do you think it’s harder for vocals to fit into math rock? Why do you think that it’s less common?\u003cbr/\u003eT: I think it is harder. I think it depends how you want the vocals to sit. We have it as quite a predominant thing. The lyrical aspect is at the forefront in a traditional sense of what a vocalist would do. They’re delivering the most obvious message to the audience in terms of lyrics and meaning that you can take directly. But yeah, I do think it’s harder for vocalists to write math rock music because it tends to be more technical. There’s less space. But I think Henry likes that. It’s more of a challenge to fit things in and perhaps not just consider lyrics, but syllables and rhythms of how he’s singing and how it’s gonna fit or where to leave space. So yeah, I think it’s more difficult but I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad thing.\u003cbr/\u003eC: I think a lot of instrumental math rock bands could benefit from having vocals. Because I personally find it gets very boring and samey without them. But that’s just what I like from music. I definitely like some vocals on them. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: You guys became a 3-piece band over three years ago, but Disappointment Island was your first album actually recording as one. Do you think that playing live as a 3-piece for so many years influenced the writing and recording process? Did it make you feel more comfortable?\u003cbr/\u003eC: When we became a 3-piece we had to make a lot of amendments to the [early] music to try and be able to play it as the three of us. So it’s been nice to have finally written an album where it’s the three of us from the start and it’s very comfortable playing it because that’s how we wrote it, whereas before we were always trying to figure out quite how to do it and never quite sounding as full. But yeah, they’ve certainly brought us closer in tightness, just being three and playing together for so long now so it does come across in that new album. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: So, this most recent album. You guys recorded it to tape and with very little overdubs. What was your reasoning behind doing that? \u003cbr/\u003eC: We just wanted to have a stripped down production to it so it was just the sound of the two guitars and the drums in a nice room. Recording it live to tape seemed to be the way that we could play the music together and get a nice energy to it and keep it simple and just play through the songs as we normally would do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: You guys toured the new album in the United States and now you’re playing it here. Have there been any songs that have been the most exciting for you to play live?\u003cbr/\u003eT: It’s always fun to play newer stuff, but what’s been nice is it doesn’t seem like there’s a standout track that people like. It seems like people’s favorite track varies. So the few new songs we’ve played, like yesterday’s, had a really good reception and it seemed like hopefully there wasn’t a duff one amongst them. So yeah, it’s been cool to play new stuff and have it received pretty well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: Continuing with your live shows, you guys always seem to tour with really fantastic bands. I’ve seen you guys play with Tera Melos, EV Kain, Mylets, And So I Watch You From Afar, and most recently Covet. Even just on your past US tour you also had LITE and Giraffes? Giraffes!. Have any of those touring lineups, those or others, been particularly special?\u003cbr/\u003eC: Yeah, they all are in their own way. You always get very close to the people you’re touring with and they become your friends. It’s always great to watch other bands who, like in the case of Tera Melos, always blow me away, like when I watch John [Clardy] drumming. We’ve been very lucky with who we’ve been able to tour with and we’ve always got on really well with all of them. So they’ve all been good in their own way. \u003cbr/\u003eT: I guess going back a little bit, one of - maybe all of ours - but one of my favorite tours was with Nate [Kinsella] from Birthmark, who we asked if he wanted to hop on a European tour with us and luckily he said yeah and it was super fun. It had a lot of challenges on that tour but he was just such a great guy to have on the road and his music is pretty special to us. So yeah, we’ve been pretty lucky to have the chance to play with such good bands over the years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: Are there any bands who you would love to tour with that the opportunity hasn’t come about yet?\u003cbr/\u003eC: I would love to tour with Deerhoof just because I think they would be a lot of fun to hang out with. \u003cbr/\u003eT: I’d love to tour with Make Believe, who’s another one of Nate’s bands but I don’t know if those guys are particularly active at the moment. But that would be great. I’d literally be front row every night just loving it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: I want to ask you guys this because I feel like this might just be me but I feel like math rock, more than other kinds of music, doesn’t take itself as seriously and there’s more fun or humor to it. Do you guys agree with that?\u003cbr/\u003eT: I think so. I think it’s probably overall a smaller genre anyway so I don’t know if there ever will be, or maybe I’m completely wrong, there’s ever gonna be a math rock band that, as such, is huge. So maybe the fact that you exist in a bubble of smaller shows where it is more intimate makes it easier -\u003cbr/\u003eC: Yeah, everyone’s sort of weird and geeky in the math rock world so I think it lends itself to people not being that serious.\u003cbr/\u003eT: Yeah, it’s very much about the musicianship and I would say that the vast majority of most audiences that go to math rock shows are in math rock bands or other bands. And they‘ll all come and talk to you about gear and stuff. I don’t know, I couldn’t imagine being in a band that doesn’t want to go and talk to people who come to shows because there’s so much in common and it’s such a positive environment. It seems weird that there is ever pretentiousness in music and that people are built up into something that is lauded as being better than anyone who’s there when those dudes are pretty much the exact same as you. So, maybe that’s a reason. Who knows. Maybe the math rock dudes who are geeky are just nice people, I don’t know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: Because you did mention gear, I have a more technical question. Tim, you use some pretty unique tunings in your songs. How do you come up with those tunings? Do you think of a riff and then find a tuning that works with it or do you just say “I wonder how this tuning would work” and then find something that comes out of it?\u003cbr/\u003eT: Yeah, it’s always just an experiment. I guess both Henry and myself, our approach to guitar has always been pretty much self-taught. So it’s just noodling around like, okay someone might show you a few chords but then it’s off on your own. I think experimenting with open tunings and going from tuning first then just finding a way around it is really interesting. I always remember this, I can’t remember what band it was, but I read this interview and the guy had specifically said that he felt open tunings were like cheat codes to a game. And I just really disagreed with it. I know I personally didn’t feel like it’s a cheat code or it’s a way to make it easier. I thought it was a bigger leap into something unknown and you’re finding a way around it, especially if you’re not from a background of theory or analyzing music in that way where it is just “Okay, I’m gonna try this out”. For me, I just thought it was really fun to come up with a chord shape that I perhaps knew and it sounds totally different or kind of invent chord shapes that, sorry not that don’t exist (laughter). Yeah, with six fingers or anything. That unknown keeps it interesting because we’ve been playing our instruments for quite a long time now and there are days where I say “I clearly don’t feel as excited about it as ten years ago” but I think with things like that, maybe for other bands new effects or whatever, it’s quite a good way to keep it personally interesting and that can develop into your songwriting and keep that fun as well. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: So Chris, when you hear a riff that Tim comes up with that’s in some really strange meters or timing, do you find that you have to try to dissect it and count it out or do you just go by feel when constructing drum parts?\u003cbr/\u003eC: Yeah, for [TTNG’s first album] Animals I did split it up into sections and count them out. Then as the riffs got more and more complicated on the later stuff where there was more half beats and things, it’s almost impossible to count and play so then that’s detrimental. So I just listen to his riff and get it in my head and then just try and play along with that or against it or something rather than splitting it up. I think it sounds a bit more flowing when I’m not like “Here’s a bar of 4, then 5, then 3”. It’s more musical to try and just pick out bits to emphasize or disagree with in certain cases. It’s easy just to feel it.\u003c/p\u003e",

Touring around the world since 2015 they made one final stop in their hometown before they embark on the European leg come October.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e9:30pm: the room goes dark. A xylophonic melody of Cradle (Better Nature), (\u003ci\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/better-nature/id1018026467\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBetter Nature\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/i\u003e) begins to play softly; anticipating an unforgettable night, the restless crowd begins to cheer. The soft audio track mutates into a heavily distorted guitar and shrill synth, juxtaposed with Brian Aubert’s–the lead singer–eerily raspy, yet powerful voice as the band emerges from the shadows. Their energy was electric and inviting from the moment they stepped on stage. We rocked out, they jammed: this was only the beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the more lighthearted moments of the set was during their performance of Circadian Rhythm (Last Dance), (\u003ci\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/better-nature/id1018026467\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBetter Nature\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/i\u003e). Before playing the second single of the album, Brian Aubert (lead singer/guitarist), stopped and showed his appreciation for us because of how supportive and welcoming his hometown was to the band.“I’m a 4th generation Angelino, my kid was born here, and I hope that their kids are born in the best city in America. It’s wild because as a band we have been to so many shows here at the Palladium. We saw Bjork here, and now to be on this stage playing for you is extremely humbling. So thank you for welcoming us back home.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHit after hit is played, until we reach arguably one of their most popular songs, Panic Switch (\u003ci\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/swoon/id952842269\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSwoons\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/i\u003e). The heavily distorted guitar riff rips through the room, Nikki Monninger (bassist) shreds, that iconic bass riff: the duo cradles each other’s sound. The crowd breaks out into a wild, nostalgic frenzy. Released in 2009, this song embodies the teen angst of my generation. To scream “I’m fading and waiting and floating away” 7 years later was, for a lack of a better term, awesome!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best part of the night. They begin playing an A capella snippet of Growing Old is Getting Old, (\u003ci\u003eSwoons\u003c/i\u003e). Silence. The G# notes on the guitar rings. The crowd roars as Lazy Eye, (\u003ci\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/carnavas/id952837622\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCarnavas\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/i\u003e), commences. We sing the melody as Brian and Nikki effortlessly play the beautiful beginning riffs. This song is so unique because of the different textures each guitar solo has, transforming the sound throughout the song. I had to mentally step away for a moment just to make sure who I was seeing was real: what I was experiencing was real. Hearing “I’ve been waiting for this moment all my life” has never meant more until then. They step off the stage and the crowd begs for more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few minutes later they returned with a fire unseen from the first part of the set.

He touched on ways in which we are united, highlighting the fact that we’re all cheering for Giannis Antetokounmpo. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009In a time where seemingly no one can agree on anything, it seems like everyone is excited about the Greek Freak. The 6’11” power forward/point guard/center/overall basketball menace is smashing the limits of a new era pioneering positional flexibility. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Giannis serves as the young Buck’s lead guard and primary shot blocker.  He who-will-not-be-pronounced-correctly is leading the team in points (22 per game), rebounds (8.3), blocks (2.1), and steals (1.9), and is a close second in assist (6). He is the only player in the league with these averages, a testament to his elite versatility. This allows him to make plays few others are capable of.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Last week against the Magic, Giannis recorded a triple-double with 20 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists, 3 blocks and 5 steals.  This has been done 5 times in NBA history since the NBA started recording blocks in the 1973-1974 season. The last player to do so was Andrei Kirilenko in 2007. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009This versatility is most evident on plays in which he gets the block after helping on the weak side, grabs the rebound, takes it full court in 4 dribbles, and finishes with a nasty Euro step. The combination of length, athleticism, timing, and handles is rare in the league. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Giannis has taken huge steps as a playmaker this year, allowing him to exercise this versatility on offense.  Around mid-season last year, Jason Kidd made him the full time starter at the point. Matthew Dellavedova has slid into the official position after he signed with the Bucks this offseason, but that hasn’t decreased Giannis’ role. The Greek Freak leads the team in touches per game at 81.9, while Dellavedova is second at 61.6. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe offense primarily runs through Giannis, and he’s making the most of it. He’s shooting a career best 51.4 percent from the field, a testament to his ability to get into the paint and finish. This is largely due to how assertive he’s been. Out of 57 qualified players (at least 60 touches per game), he’s 39th in seconds per touch. This shows he’s getting into his moves quickly, especially considering the burden he must carry on offense. His high scoring and assist numbers show that he is beginning to produce at elite levels. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The scariest part is that his game is still unrefined; he has the potential to get a lot better. Primarily, he needs to develop a better jump shot.  He’s shooting 25 percent on catch and shoot attempts, and 24.4 percent on pull-up attempts. Defenses sag several feet off of him when he’s standing at the three-point line, which damages the Bucks’ spacing and makes his drives tougher. He and Jabari Parker have developed a great sense of timing on cuts to combat these shooting issues, but if they can start to rain jump-shots, then their potential is unthinkable. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009The Bucks will be much better when they get Middleton back. Giannis and Jabari are both only 21. They have time to improve their game. Both have taken a huge step up this year, and look to keep getting better. Before long, Giannis will become such a household name that we’ll all learn how to pronounce ‘Antetokounmpo.’\u003c/p\u003e",

Midway through the interview, guitarist Grant Mullen joined us. He cited his favorite stop on tour as Hot Springs, Arkansas.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“There were natural hot springs. We went in them. They rejuvenated us.” Henry elaborated; “There’s a big mountain that has a lot of water stocked up in it, so there’s a little tourist town where they have bath houses, that are just natural mountain water that is just naturally heated by the whatever science tectonic plates and shit. So they would harness that, but we would just soak for like three hours.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI leave them there, hoping to squeeze my way to the front for their set. I slipped through the crowd, grabbing a spot near the front on the right side of the stage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Are you guys Naked Giants?” a CSH fan asked as she leaned into the stage. Bassist Gianni Aiello smiled and nodded as he fumbled with the chords on stage. The crowd watched intently as the band began to set up, trying to distinguish the band members from the stage crew while they quickly search “Naked Giants” on their phones. As with most opening bands, few in the audience had heard of Naked Giants, but within the first few seconds of the opening song, the crowd became chaotic, aggressively banging their heads and thrashing their bodies around in a fashion that somewhat resembled dancing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"428\" data-orig-width=\"640\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8bb99527c16476697c2dc981d8f64799/tumblr_inline_ohp8jpiTX81qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"428\" data-orig-width=\"640\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eGianni demanded the attention of the audience, frantically moving his hips to the beat of the music and dropping to the floor in fits of passion. Opposite Gianni, Grant shook his head as he sang, feverently flipping his straggly blonde hair across his face. Refusing to be overlooked, Henry used his entire body in playing the drums, losing his vest and bandana in the process. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTheir set left the audience both exhausted and exhilarated. Before the show, Henry explained that, “I really like playing shows where I’m playing on the ground level, with the people. Which if I want to be a big, famous drummer probably isn’t going to last that long. They connect better with me, and I connect better with them when I’m like right there.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough the Teragram Ballroom is a relatively small venue, it is large enough for for the divide between those onstage and the audience to be felt, but the passion and indulgence that Naked Giants put into their set made it feel intimate. So to Henry, I say that the connection between the band and the audience is not dictated by the size of the venue. I imagine that whether they’re playing a house show or a festival, the energy that Naked Giants puts in is not lost in effect.\u003c/p\u003e",

For the purposes of this article,\nI’m conjecturing something less drastic. Some feel that duress to our extant democracy means political reformation.

Here’s some loose\nchange on the future of American political parties—\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe Democratic Party will emphasize states’ rights in its ideology. \u003c/i\u003eThough the\nRepublicans (and not Democrats) are historically known to champions states’ rights over\nfederally dictated laws, I find that states’ rights is a solution to Democrats’ problems. With the\npresident-elect purporting to erase all remnants of our dear lame duck, the future of America\nlooks inhospitable to the progressive. Although Clinton won the popular vote, Trump won the\nmajority of districts. The central bastions of progressives are the two coasts, CO, and so forth.\nThese blue states will welcome strengthening of states’ rights to distance themselves from an\nantithetically motivated executive branch thus preserving the progressive legacy. Furthermore,\nTrump is known to support states’ rights himself, so the potential for sharper legal distinctions\nbetween states seems high.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe Republican Party will combine libertarian economic sense with alt-right social\nsentiment.\u003c/i\u003e The alt-right has become a favorite subject of discourse for major media outlets these\nlast few months. Adults are always late to catch-on to the newest fad. Every ten years a local\nnews channel plays a story about whippets five years after high schoolers have found a new\naerosol to get high to. The same is true of memes. The Republican Party is criticized as being the party of old white men. But this is no longer true. Now it appears to be the party of old and\nyoung (mostly) white men. The Republicans will imitate the meme motif of the alt-right to\nappear relevant just like Drake did by having a campy photoshop on his latest album cover. The\nmodern Republicans almost always support fewer business regulations. I can’t imagine that this\nchanges because: i) Trump is a businessman, in some sense of the word; and ii) the alt-right\ncorroborates much of Trump’s social views, but lacks any core political ideology beyond acute\nnationalism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eMembers of the Democratic and Republican Parties will develop gills like fish to\nempower their new underwater lifestyles when the sea levels rise. \u003c/i\u003eI recognize that this level of\nspeculation may be unsettling to some readers asking, “Why gills and not blowholes?” It is a\nsalient question considering our mammalian cousins, the whales, have blowholes and not gills.\nFish, of course, are taxonomically more distant than whales. Commuting the Lamarckian\nframework of evolution to American political parties subjects the dichotomy to a worldly\nuncertainness. Yet the biological yield is fruitful. That untapped epigenetic circulatory\nvariegation of species \u003ci\u003ehomo sapiens \u003c/i\u003eleaves underdetermined any answer to a question “Why gills\nand not blowholes?” In recognizing the potential for both we diffuse the Republican-Democratic-\ntwo-party-dialectic.

Amidst the array of\nbacklash and angry festival-goers demanding refunds, I can’t help but stand in\nsupport with the nightmarish festival experience—if you can even call it that.\nThroughout the years, the scene has never been a glowing archetype of how a\nfestival should operate. It’s always been a logistical nightmare with its\novercrowded claustrophobic feel, unbearable sound quality, and unorganized set\ntimes. In fact, the punkish attitudes of the artists inside their lo-fi bubble\nand the contributors born into the Burger scene seem to perpetuate this type of\nindie, psychedelic grittiness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/fd79afd2e1c9893f9294b566c72f58a2/tumblr_inline_og1sa3KW0S1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile the first day unfolded without a\nkink, I couldn’t comfortably say the same about the second day. As the rain\ncame in waves, dampening the festival-goers in body and spirit, the chaos began\nto ensue as artists changed and even cancelled their scheduled sets. For most\nof day two, I was huddled in the green room above the Observatory waiting for\nthe rain to subside and for the crowds to disperse from their usual cattle herd\nformation. I couldn’t help but laugh at the scene of the fuming mom jean clad\ncrowd attempting to break their way through the chain of pink shirted security\nguards. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/af65092aaa75175a9033b5f5a7f6fc22/tumblr_inline_og1s9uSVZ91qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3456\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut still, the remaining acts (besides\nGrimes), rallied.

Quality-wise,\nit was kind of a train wreck.  Weekend\nafter weekend I went. Movie after movie:  Bourne, Magnificent Seven, you name it - they\nwere unbelievably bad. After a few hundred dollars spent, many weekends wasted\nand wondering if my marriage was going to hold up until school started in the\nfall, I gave up and watched the new seasons of \u003ci\u003eTransparent\u003c/i\u003e, \u003ci\u003eBallers\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eMr. Robot \u003c/i\u003erather than go to the theater\nagain.  I’ve loved going to the movies\never since my first one, so many years ago that there were still ashtrays in\nthe armrests and nobody cared if an 8-year snuck into an R-rated movie.  But with this kind of quality at these kinds\nof prices, I couldn’t do it anymore.  I\ngave up the ghost. I stayed home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut just when it seemed over, I began to hear whispers. It’s\nhow word-of-mouth amongst movie fans really works.  At a job interview, on the train, in line at\nthe supermarket, I heard people mentioning this one release – and everything I\nheard made me want to know more. It was an animated movie.  A hero’s journey type thing that should have\nbeen ordinary except for the fact that everyone kept talking about how extraordinary\nit was. I had to see it.  Without telling\na soul, I finally headed to the theater for a midweek, mid-summer matinee on my\nown – and that’s how I discovered the best release of the summer – \u003ci\u003eKubo and the Two Strings \u003c/i\u003e(2016 – D.\nTravis Knight).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e “If you must blink,\ndo it now.” is the very first line of this breathtaking stop-motion animated\nfilm.  From the first moment until the\nvery last frame, the film delivers on visual style, sharp screenwriting and\ncrisp, clear characterization that would put any live-action release of the\nsummer to shame.  From his first moment\nonscreen, young Kubo faces a world filled with grim realities and vivid dreams\nthat live in the waking world.  Facing a\nseries of challenges placed upon him at birth, he navigates an increasingly\ntreacherous landscape with ingenuity and the assistance of a surrogate family\ncomprised of a talking snow gorilla and a large insect/man hybrid.  While this may sound clunky, the film and\nnarrative are executed with seamless and lyric grace in the vein of Kurosawa\nwith a touch of Tim Burton.  The\nanimation is spellbinding and the performances by an array of star talent\nvoicing the lead characters are excellent. \nStorytelling is the foundation of magic in Kubo’s world, and that same\nmagic is what he needs to survive it.  The ending will surprise you in such an\nelegant and heart-wrenching way that I can promise you will never be able to\nanticipate it.  Do yourself a favor,\ndon’t try.  Let this movie wash over you,\nmove through you, and change you.  \u003ci\u003eKubo and the Two Strings\u003c/i\u003e is water for\nthe soul that thirsts for beautiful storytelling.  Deeply resonant and fiercely committed, this\nmovie saved me from my summer blockbuster cynicism.  It might do something interesting for you\ntoo. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo that’s how \u003ci\u003eKubo and\nthe Two Strings\u003c/i\u003e saved me from my own bitterness and restored my faith in\nthe movie business, more or less.  I did\nmyself a favor after I saw it and haven’t been back to the theaters since.  It was an experience I want to keep close to\nmy heart which means I can’t let just any other movie muscle in on the space\nI’ve given it there.  I won’t lie – for\nme, the summer blockbuster is a thing of the past.  If Doug Liman ever comes back to direct\nanother Bourne movie I might be tempted, but he’s never going to do it and so I\ndon’t have to make that decision.  Until\nthen, I’ll keep my eyes peeled for more by Laika, the animation house that\nproduced this lovely and compelling tribute to the art of storytelling.  For those who must continue to go, a glass of\nChardonnay at the Pasadena Arclight costs 9 bucks – bring your own special\nsalt. \u003c/p\u003e",

Opening with Tamaryn, they followed the essential shoegaze\nstarterpack: long bangs covering their faces, heavily distorted guitars with an\nextravagant amount of reverb, and great dreamy music. They were a surprise that\nI was happy to discover, their set consisted of songs like “Cranekiss”, which rattled\nthe floor of The Fonda with banging drums from what sounded like a vintage 90’s\ndrum machine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1024\" data-orig-width=\"1545\" style=\"\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b747a5b0c3343bd81949117435d499f6/tumblr_inline_of2gm5ZWbD1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1024\" data-orig-width=\"1545\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eLush opened up with “De-Luxe” and in the beginning of the\nset, singer and guitarist Miki Berenyi told the crowd to “put their fucking\nphones away” in a cheeky voice that had the crowd applaud and cheer. Because of\nthe lack of iPhones being waved around in the crowd, I felt like I had\ntransformed back to the early 90’s. For the most part, Lush played their\nshoegaze classics from the album “Split” and “Spooky”, but also managed to slip\nin a new song of theirs titled “Out of Control” which sounded nearly identical\nto their songs prior to their breakup. “Ladykillers” was played somewhat near\nthe end of their set, which changed the atmosphere of the show from dreamy\nshoegaze to their more Britpop high-thumping catalog.

We’ve grown up thinking everything is about us. Jack Garratt makes it about us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a dimly lit room of the depths of the Observatory, an epiphany is about to happen. These fleeting moments awaken us from the stillness of daily ritual, allowing the existential crisis we once had to cease for a moment as we appreciate the vulnerability of British superstar Jack Garratt. The power of a good-live performance is enough to bring a smile, but the power of the Jack Garratt Show is enough to make humans romantic again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJack Garratt, best known for his boyish smirk and impressive red beard, brings a British charm last seen when the Beatles were around. He’s ready for this “Phase” in his life, where he’s toured internationally at music festivals to debut his latest album- “Phase.” Performing at Outside Lands and ACL, just to name a few, the audience at the Observatory are close enough to see the sweat drip on the Brit’s forehead. Normally we’d be bothered. This time, we welcome it.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eCouples on their first dates begin to hold hands, a birthday girl cries for recognition. The set begins suddenly, and Jack immediately jumps into his first song of the Phase album, “Coalesce”, beginning the percussion and multitasking as he sings into his mic. He doesn’t stop at percussion, as his guitar anxiously waits for its turn. Jumping from instrument to instrument, Jack appears calm and frantic all at once, as he searches for the right sounds to evoke emotion. It works. His voice sounds as melancholic as heard through headphones, as he gracefully displays the range of the highs and lows of an acapella tone. Without waiting for a transition or taking a breath, as soon as the song ends, “Breathe Life” and “Far Cry” keep the crowd on their feet. Throughout all three songs, Jack’s genuinely smiling, and it makes us wonder if he’s singing the song to someone particular. His energy remains consistent and happy throughout the entire show, and for that hour, time stands still as we experience Jack Garratt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHalfway through the set, Jack admits a confession- he’s exhausted, and with a laugh, he asks if he could do a cover. Covering the now infamous rendition of “Fresh Prince”, Jack lures in the YG crowd next door. Mid song, he notices them. “Don’t be shy! Come on in.” Midway through song, as the crowd in the back pauses to enter the room, Jack jumps in to humming “elevator music”, resembling the sound of a jazzy kazoo through the microphone. “We can wait” he jokes, as the theater feels like an elevator with hundreds of people. Suddenly, he jumps in to a cover of Justin Timberlake’s “Seniorita”, and the intimacy grew closer with each strumming motion of the guitar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven for a red bearded brit who’s been touring for the past several months across the globe, the show has just begun. Jack Garratt, better known as the Jack of all trades, has built his show so that he can legally, in public, “play with himself in front of people.” That’s the point of it, he says. “This shouldn’t be a show where I come for an hour to play a song and that’s it. The audience should be left feeling just as physically and mentally exhausted as I am, otherwise I haven’t done my job.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJack’s been playing music his whole life, and knew this would always be a part of his career. Finding the bravery to leave college where he was originally going to become a music teacher, he found himself doing music full time. “I am the least important person in the room. I walk out on stage, and I have to give and share a moment with whoever else is in the room. I have to take myself out of the equation. I know nothing that will happen on stage, its up to the crowd as to what happens on that point. But I have to help them.” Jack’s performances are unique to each show, even though his set list remains the same. Like different colors, the energy remains the same, we just experience it differently.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJack references a conversation with (UCLA Radio’s) Jack Black, who said “We are one person on a planet of billions of people. We must remember we are so small, so it makes it fun to walk on stage and remember that we are still so small…The reason I can say I am the least important person when I’m stage, is because I know I’m the most important person in my life.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf Jack Garratt wasn’t a performer, he’d be a philosopher.

As someone who’s been following the band for a while, it was pretty exciting to see them catching fire overseas especially since the California-native band has yet to tour within the United States. When listening to high volumes of math rock, I’ve found that there are many bands whose sounds may blend together and start to sound more or less the same. Floral has never been one of those bands. Their music is easily recognizable, which comes in large part as a result of Nate Sherman’s rapidly virtuosic and highly melodic style of guitar playing. These qualities are very prominent on the band’s two EPs and their live shows have the added bonus of highlighting both the tightness of the band’s musical chemistry and the high levels of complexity that both guys make seem so effortless. I sat down with Nate and drummer Ty Mayer just hours before the last show of their tour, which was also the largest show they’d ever played. \u003ca href=\"http://uclaradio.tumblr.com/post/150968888330/top-5-most-anticipated-acts-at-arctangent\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFor more about their festival set, check out my “Top 5 Most Anticipated Acts at ArcTanGent” list here\u003c/a\u003e.

How has it been for you guys?\u003cbr/\u003eNate: Unprecedented. \u003cbr/\u003eTy: Really really fun. Especially because you were at a few of the shows.\u003cbr/\u003eLayla: I was at many of the shows. I was even at some shows you didn’t see me at. I just decided to stop by in disguises.\u003cbr/\u003eTy: Oh wow. Is that true? That’s not true.\u003cbr/\u003eLayla: No, it’s not true. \u003cbr/\u003eTy: I could almost see that.\u003cbr/\u003eLayla: No, I had plans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: How have the UK audiences compared to the American ones?\u003cbr/\u003eN: They’re better. I mean, we’ve had great shows in the US, of course. But I don’t think we expected to feel this good about coming to another country and feeling as welcomed as we were by not just the people watching our shows but the other bands we were playing with and people we’re staying with and promoters. They’re all really stoked to have us and really stoked to be here so it feels really good.\u003cbr/\u003eL: Yeah, I feel like the math rock scene in the UK tends to be, if not bigger then just more connected than in the US. Would you guys agree with that?\u003cbr/\u003eT: We only have a small amount of data points to go on so it’s hard to say but that’s what it seems like to us, yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: In your time in the UK, have you picked up any British slang that you’re bringing back to the US with you?\u003cbr/\u003eN: I would say wanking. That’s a big one. I mean, I always refer to wanking as playing guitar really weirdly but now we have another use for it. I’ve started referring to things as half-two and half-three instead of two-thirty or three-thirty. Ty accidentally said uni at one point.\u003cbr/\u003eT: I did. Someone had just said it to me twenty seconds before so that then became the word for that minute for college. But it’s called college.\u003cbr/\u003eN: After a few beers you start to have the same mannerism and phrasing as the people around you, just completely unconsciously. I’ll try to sound American but it just doesn’t work sometimes. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: I know you guys don’t have any touring plans in the future. But if you could choose another country to tour which one would you choose next?\u003cbr/\u003eT: We were hearing good things about Germany last night, so probably that one.\u003cbr/\u003eN: Yeah, Malik from Town Portal was saying, “Go to Germany”. They put you up and apparently they just really appreciate artists over there. And honestly, compared to the US, this has been pretty good too. But people have said very high things about Germany and just mainland Europe in general. It seems to be the place to be.\u003cbr/\u003eT: I think if we did Germany, we’d bring my mom and she’d be our translator.\u003cbr/\u003eL: Oh, does your mom speak German?\u003cbr/\u003eT: She does. She was a German teacher. We have no German heritage but she accidentally wound up in a German class once and basically it became her major. So we would bring her along.\u003cbr/\u003eN: How do you think your mom would hold up on tour, Ty?\u003cbr/\u003eT: Better than me, for sure. She knows how to camp. She can rough it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: Getting more into gear stuff. Nate, I know you’re not technically endorsed by Daisy Rock yet.\u003cbr/\u003eN: No, it’s sort of a joke that the hashtag #daisyrockpleaseendorsenate has found its way into various posts. And I don’t know, I hope they’ll [see] this interview and listen to my music and think “This guy would do pretty well with the Daisy Rock endorsement”. You know, just send me a few free guitars. I already have 3 Daisy Rocks and I want more to keep them in all sorts of tunings.\u003cbr/\u003eL: Can you talk about why you chose Daisy Rock? Because I don’t think I’ll see any others at this festival. \u003cbr/\u003eN: Well, my mom bought one. I think because she thought it was cute. But I always liked having different guitars to keep in different tunings. I was experimenting with trying to find a tuning for this project that is now Floral and I took it from my mom without asking because she wasn’t really playing it and I restrung it and it just sort of stuck. I guess I really liked how light they are. I’m really not a fan of heavy guitars And they were short, which was a big deal actually because my high string is tuned so high and I actually tried doing the same tuning that I do on a different guitar and I kept on snapping the high string. Which meant that I probably should have gotten a thinner string. But it worked on this guitar. It’s the Daisy Rock Rock Candy Special. It’s like a custom. I haven’t been able to find the same model online for a while. But yeah [they’re] just light, short, they look cool. That’s a big one, that they look really cool. \u003cbr/\u003eL: Yeah, they do. They’re fun.\u003cbr/\u003eN: They are fun. They’re fun guitars. And they sound great. Honestly, people come up to me and they’re like “Ah man, your tone is so good. What kind of pickups do you use?” And they’re expecting me to say “EMG Bare Knuckles” or something like that. And I’m like “No, these are just the stock pickups that came in my Daisy Rock”. They’re Seymour Duncans. They have a coil tap and everything so sometimes if I’m feeling it I’ll just pull the coil tap and play single coil for some songs. But yeah, that’s why I like them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"543\" data-orig-height=\"662\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a3fffc498aae7ba27b33adfa57e95278/tumblr_inline_odqg1bwN4s1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"543\" data-orig-height=\"662\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: Awesome. So, I happen to know that you guys have been playing music together for many years. But at what point did you decide to make the switch to math rock and give birth to what is now Floral?\u003cbr/\u003eT: Three years ago, I think. We were in another band where we played different instruments and we had a drummer. And at one point the drummer’s schedule just conflicted too much and we had to stop playing with him. I think I had already started living with Nate at the time, or at least I was going over everyday. So he just pulled out “Climbing a Wall”, the riff from that, and so we started working on that. \u003cbr/\u003eN: And we wrote other songs.\u003cbr/\u003eL: And now you have two EPs together.\u003cbr/\u003eN: Yeah. Pretty much all the songs for both EPs were written around the same time, like within the same year. But we recorded them a year apart. So it was cool to have all that backlog. And when we played, after releasing the first EP, it was cool to be able to play songs that weren’t on that. Then eventually they all got released. Hopefully we’ll write new songs soon too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: Did the songs that were on the 2nd EP grow at all in playing live or were they pretty much the same as when you first wrote them?\u003cbr/\u003eN: Ooh, that’s actually a good question. Because we had the songs down and they weren’t recorded. We would just jam them out and we remembered how to play them every time. So maybe not consciously, but I can definitely think of some things \u0026ndash;\u003cbr/\u003eT: What was the question? I missed the question.\u003cbr/\u003eL: The question was did the songs from the 2nd EP that you hadn’t recorded yet evolve while you were playing them live or were they pretty much the same?\u003cbr/\u003eT: Well, Nate had the structures down but we just got better at them while playing them live. I probably finalized certain things while playing them live but Nate’s part probably didn’t change too much. \u003cbr/\u003eN: I mean, I‘ve found sometimes when you write something, you’re not playing it the most efficient way possible. At first [you’re] just trying to figure out what the best sounding way to play the same part is. But there’s definitely little things that did shift around. The structures all stayed the same pretty much from the very beginning. But there definitely are little things, very little things.\u003cbr/\u003eT: I guess “Climbing a Wall” was just half of that song for the first few months and then after we’d written some other ones, we combined two songs into one. \u003cbr/\u003eN: Yeah, speaking of the first EP. That was definitely an example of that. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: What were the early bands you guys were listening to when you decided to \u0026ndash; Were you consciously thinking “let’s do a math rock band” or was that just the sound that came out?\u003cbr/\u003eN: It was kinda conscious, I think. Parent Guardian, our old band, had some math stuff in it. We experimented with not playing in 4/4 and 6/8 all the time. I was listening to a lot of Town Portal at the time, I found them online and jammed their songs all the time. And then Ty started showing me some bands too, like Three Trapped Tigers and Daughters. He showed me Piglet as well, I think. And Invalids, another huge one obviously. So it was just hearing those bands and thinking “Oh man, people can make music like this” and then I realized I could do it too. \u003cbr/\u003eT: I think the first two songs that we wrote, especially because “Climbing a Wall” didn’t have the second part, they weren’t really math rock. It was just that he was finger-tapping, which people call math rock. But it was really straightforward time signature. I think it wasn’t until the third or fourth song that we had anything like that in there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: I want to know what do you guys think about the term “math rock”? How would you define it and do you think it’s accurate to your own music? Because it seems like a pretty vague term for some people.\u003cbr/\u003eT: I actually think as a genre term, it’s one of those things that it now means a specific kind of music to a lot of people. But the idea of calling rock with odd time signatures math rock makes a lot of sense. It’s one of the more sensible genre names that exist.\u003cbr/\u003eN: It does definitely make sense but I feel as though a lot of math rock isn’t necessarily any more complicated than a Frank Sinatra tune. A lot of older music had plenty of short bars and stuff like that and I feel like that’s slowly made its way back into rock-like music. And now we have math rock. Maybe if I’d invented the genre I might have called it something different but I feel as though it’s definitely appropriate. I definitely don’t mind labeling things as a person, I think it’s pretty natural for people to do that. So as a blanket term it definitely makes sense. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: So, later today you guys have the biggest show you’ve ever played. Do you have any special additions to your regular set or any surprises you’re willing to divulge?\u003cbr/\u003eN: We’re playing longer. We’re usually pretty concise with our set but we have a time slot to fill. It’s cool to do that every once in a while. I’m not mad about playing a long set today. Also Dominique, who is doing a juggling set during Gulfers’ set today is going to run over and do a song with us as well. She’s going to do a pretty sweet hat juggling act so that’ll be cool. \u003cbr/\u003eT: Also, violent nudity by the end of the show. But that is a surprise.\u003cbr/\u003eL: Is the beginning of the show going to be more subdued nudity and then get more violent as the set goes on?\u003cbr/\u003eT: You’ll have to wait and see.\u003cbr/\u003eL: I will be very excited for that. \u003c/p\u003e",

Since being discovered as Dr. Dre’s protégé, he has arguably become\none of the most iconic figures in Hip-Hop. Both of his albums, \u003ci\u003egood kid, m.A.A.d city\u003c/i\u003e, and \u003ci\u003eTo Pimp a Butterfly\u003c/i\u003e, are both platinum\ncertified and considered classics.

In 2015 they released two back-to-back albums, \u003ci\u003eDepression Cherry\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eThank You Lucky Stars\u003c/i\u003e, both of which\nwere sensational. Grimes also released one of the greatest albums of 2015 with \u003ci\u003eArt Angels\u003c/i\u003e. Dancing away to Grimes’\nunique sounds will be a one-of-a-kind experience. Dev Hynes (Blood Orange), who\nhas been a writer for artists such as Solange, Tinashe and FKA Twigs, recently\nreleased his third studio album, \u003ci\u003eFreetown\nSound\u003c/i\u003e. Blood Orange provides a rich 80’s R\u0026amp;B aesthetic mixed with a\nmodern sound, which results in a constant pleasure of timeless music. Long\nBeach’s Vince Staples is personally one of my favorite current rappers.\nStaples’ provides a combination of dark lyrics and a catchy flow that he\nusually laces over bass-heavy instrumentals. The combination of Vince Staples\nmusical elements results in a very enjoyable audio experience. Atlanta’s Young\nThug is another artist I am looking forward to. Young Thug will bring another\ndynamic to FYF that will keep the weekend interesting and full of energy. With\nhits such as “Lifestyle,” “About The Money,” and even working with Jamie xx on\n“I Know There’s Gonna Be (Good Times),” Young Thug is another artist that will\nbring iconic moments to the memorable weekend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DBjLBB-TMa84\"\u003e\u003ciframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" id=\"youtube_iframe\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BjLBB-TMa84?feature=oembed\u0026amp;enablejsapi=1\u0026amp;origin=https://safe.txmblr.com\u0026amp;wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

Fronting two guitars and a bass, The HAIM sisters—Este, Danielle, and Alana—are the girls that broke through the proverbial glass ceiling of a male dominated industry. This power trio headlined for Red Bull’s 30 Days in LA on November 15. With their last album \u003ci\u003eDays Are Gone\u003c/i\u003e released in 2013, the crowd bubbled with excitement for the sisters to bang out their newest tunes. For anyone who is unfamiliar with HAIM’s music, their sound is displayed as a kinetic amalgam of many different musical influences—namely rock and synth pop. Undoubtedly, the band is acclimated to playing high energy shows accompanied by a highly engaged audience that raises their hands when ordered to and acts as a backing chorus when a microphone is pointed their way. Easily, the band showcased their undeniable musical talent with their first song “Forever,” that was complimented with a plethora of stank faces and synchronized dance moves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"533\" data-orig-width=\"800\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9d6e54451a1d93585fd6753759b3eda1/tumblr_inline_ohztzt1AdO1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"533\" data-orig-width=\"800\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009With their impressive performance prowess, I couldn’t help but notice that almost every person in the crowd failed to participate in an organic concert experience. At the start of the show, with Steven A. Clark and Charlotte Day Wilson as the openers, the crowd seemed disengaged from the obvious emotional catharsis occurring on stage. As Wilson poured her soul on stage, the audience seemed more interested in conversing about Saturday brunch and how-to articles on BuzzFeed. Even as HAIM made their way on stage, arms in the audience quickly shot up, iPhone in hand, in order to snap the best picture for Instagram—a platform so engaged in pleasing, pandering, and pretension.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"533\" data-orig-width=\"800\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5a095f25da3a8f7dccf23e2ca01a2365/tumblr_inline_ohzu0j9mfi1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"533\" data-orig-width=\"800\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe audience’s blatant disinterest in the talented musicians right in front of them had me thinking about the ingenuity of emotion and personal style. As the bands began to play new songs, the battle of voices between conversation of the audience and the singers made itself obvious to me. This sentiment, specifically in 2016, poses the dilemma of how the public is devouring music in the modern age. It seems as if populists are more interested in going to shows purely for their ‘live value’ rather than attending for the pure, unadulterated musical talent. Thus, bands are forced to resort to playing well-known, well-loved tunes that are familiar to the audience’s ears. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\nWith the like-obsessed audience in mind, it seemed to me that HAIM’s ‘cool girl’ persona was at best pandering to the popular notion of what an all-girl band should be. Their array of stank faces, moody glances, and nonchalant attitude initially translated into a way to feed into what the general population wanted them to be. With HAIM’s backing on high-end magazines, A-list friendships, and sold out shows, their trendsetting and “original” persona has been glued directly into their image as a band, leaving them no choice to adhere to what the public wants. We’ve seen this before. Call it selling out. Call it the reality of the music industry.\n\n\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWritten by: Ryland Towne, UCLA Radio Sports \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003ePost Date: 12/4/16\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith finals approaching and our football team taking what seem like endless losses, it appears as if all hope is lost for UCLA. Yet there appears to be light at the end of the tunnel - with the recent 74-67 win over Texas A\u0026amp;M, the UCLA mens basketball team has clinched their first tournament title.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Wooden legacy appeared to be a breeze for the Bruins with opponents Portland, Nebraska, and eventually Texas A\u0026amp;M taking on the incoming 4-0 team.  Portland could not stop the onslaught of offensive power and UCLA rolled over them, outscoring Portland 99-77. During halftime, the father of superstar freshman Lonzo Ball spoke with the announcers.  Beyond analysis of his son’s game, Ball’s father made a surprising statement proclaiming that the Bruins would be winning the NCAA championship this year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis got me thinking.  With the new additions of Lonzo Ball and T.J. Leaf, does UCLA have a chance at making a significant run in the big tournament?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn all honesty, I believe Mr. Ball would reclaim that statement if he saw how UCLA played in the next two games.  While they did dominate over Nebraska and Texas A\u0026amp;M, there were flaws exposed in both games. While the Bruins defeated Nebraska by double digits, the Cornhuskers stuck around for nearly the entire game.  One reason was that Nebraska’s Tai Webster and Glynn Watson Jr. were playing some of the best basketball they’ll play all year.  They combined for a total of 47 points, more than two-thirds of their entire team’s final score.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUCLA can run-and-gun offensively with nearly any team in the nation.  With Ball’s seemingly effortless scoring ability as well as a more dominant presence in the paint thanks to Leaf, UCLA appears to have a balanced offense. However, when players like Webster and Watson Jr. get hot, it will be interesting to see how UCLA reacts.  In the Nebraska game they resorted to a spread 3-2 defense, which proved effective but did not slow down Watson Jr. from launching beyond the three-point line. For the Texas A\u0026amp;M game, UCLA largely depended on the offensive persistence of Hamilton.  Alford went scoreless during the first half but made a resurgence in the second half, scoring 13 critical points.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Bruins will have their hands full when they begin to face top-ranked teams. I believe they will find that while their offense is commanding, they must not depend on it. The rest of the season will serve as a true testament to whether UCLA can uphold Mr. Ball’s prediction of a 114th NCAA championship.\u003c/p\u003e",

You can go to shows alone with no explanation and no awkwardness. You can go to shows alone and not speak to a soul and have a grand time. And you can go to shows alone and make eight new friends and leave the venue with glitter all over your face and four new Instagram mutuals. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat was my Friday night on November 11th.  PWR BTTM at the Bootleg was the best show I have attended in my twenty-two years of existence. To think that I might have missed it all because of social mores! Every show you attend alone will not be like that, but I want to encourage you to attend shows alone because it will increase your chance of having that one night where you feel like you are exactly where you need to be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePWR BTTM is a special band. They are an explicitly queer indie rock band that create songs that are both campy and vulnerable. Their shows are true performances. Liv and Ben, the band\u0026rsquo;s main members, have an unmatched onstage repartee. Ben typically slathers glitter and stickers on their face. During the show I attended they brought a person wearing a chicken wing costume onstage. I know of very few contemporary bands that seem to be having as much fun onstage as they are. Please go watch their \u003ca href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/03/30/472462205/pwr-bttm-tiny-desk-concert\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTiny Desk Concert\u003c/a\u003e and see for yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eTheir fans often participate in the camp and the glamour. When I arrived at the venue, the glory of the PWR BTTM fan base was on full display. Lined up and down Beverly Blvd were kids and adults doused in sequins and glitter. People all across the gender spectrum were holding hands, laughing, and hanging out after a truly horrible week for queers and minorities of all kinds. One person even wore a pastel pink wig.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI mentioned that I came alone, and alone I stayed for half an hour or so. I sat down and watched the opener, Lisa Prank play her set. Lisa Prank\u0026rsquo;s aesthetic and work fit in well with PWR BTTM. She wore a sparkly gold paper crown and sung about her feelings. She shone brightest when she turned off her drum machine and played her songs with just her and her guitar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen I got up to use the bathroom and made friends with four teenagers in the line. It all started because one of them took out four markers and asked me if I wanted to draw on their pants. Soon we were talking about post-Halloween sales and exploring the venue together. And, the Bootleg is a great place to explore. For some unknown reason we found a collection of statues featuring barbies and trophies while wandering the halls. I also recognized rock royalty Patty Schemel (of Hole aka my favorite 90s alternative band) and Waxahatchee amongst the crowd. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe settled in to watch the Bellows set next. Bellows is a more standard, four piece indie band, complete with a bassist, guitarist, keyboardist, and drummer. Like all the music that night, their songs are emotional and leaky in a way I crave and appreciate. The group next to me started swaying and I joined them. Suddenly they were all introducing themselves to me and passing me glitter packets to apply to my face. They took a group selfie and insisted I join them. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you try to listen to Bellows on the device of your choosing you might not think it lends itself to dancing, but not so at their live shows. Me and my new friends jumped up and down, rocked and swayed through the whole set. I have never had so much fun dancing to emo music with strangers. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy the time PWR BTTM took the stage the whole crowd was dancing. Due to the current state of our country, I could feel how much we all needed to be there. And so, everyone was going to get as much out of the show as they possibly could. After a few songs, when the vibe was higher than I have ever felt at any other show, Ben yelled, \u0026ldquo;THIS IS WHY I\u0026rsquo;M NOT AFRAID! Because there are so many of us and so few of them.\u0026rdquo; \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so PWR BTTM directly addressed the election of Donald Trump and all the fear that has come with it. And yet, the whole show was exploding with hope and creativity. The bands\u0026rsquo; van and almost all of their gear and clothes were also stolen two days earlier in San Francisco, but there they all were, strutting and confident onstage in all of their queer, sparkly glory. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe crowd sang along to the songs they knew and rocked out to the new material the band played. The pink wig I had seen in line earlier migrated up to the stage where the bassist wore it and Ben and Liv joked about how dry it looked. It was an hour of pure magic. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI left the show high off of the kindness of strangers and the glory in the queer and the different. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe upcoming days seem dark and sometimes they scare me, but PWR BTTM and all of those lovely strangers showed me how beautiful we can be in struggle. We can sparkle and shine and even dance with new friends as we fight and suffer for a better world\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe concert was like a wave washing over me, cooing, \u003ci\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s all right, It\u0026rsquo;s all right, we\u0026rsquo;re all here, have some glitter, let\u0026rsquo;s dance. And then\u003c/i\u003e\u003ci\u003e,\u003c/i\u003e\u003ci\u003e let\u0026rsquo;s build together and let\u0026rsquo;s fight.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

You may be thinking, what a specific qualm to have regarding such a particular subject. Ah yes, but if you saw the amount of Planned Parenthood propaganda I have on hand, you would understand my obsession with controlling the overpopulation of our planet through one of our main sources of human genetic material, sperm count. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eNow you may be asking, what about the womxn of our society, don’t they too have genetic material? Well, if you are asking a question like that you probably missed that one class on the history of women’s oral contraceptives, and thus should sit down and study up, kiddo. \u003cbr/\u003eAs we are well aware, both men and women are responsible for pregnancy, yet more times than not the burden of attempting to prevent this outcome falls more on one gender than the other. For years, men’s only options for birth control revolved around the three methods of “pulling out,” which is extremely ineffective, condoms, and sterilization. Thus, the burden remained on women to take more precaution and use other forms of contraceptives to prevent pregnancy, until now. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThat’s right folks, since 2011 a trial to create a new contraceptive for men in the form of a shot has been in full swing, until the study was cut short due to adverse side effects. Now you may be thinking, What crazy side effects must have occurred to cause a complete shutdown of a study on this new revolutionary form of birth control for men? Well kiddo, as one who is extremely invested in the issue of lack of contraceptive options for men, I can give you all the sweet deets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eAccording to CNN.com, “Serious negative effects resulting from the shots included one case of depression and one experience of an abnormally fast and irregular heartbeat after the injections stopped,” which was probably caused by “one intentional overdose of acetaminophen” determined by researchers of the study. Other side effects include injection site pain, muscle pain, increased libido and acne. Yet researchers of the study reported that “nearly 39% of these symptoms \u0026ndash; including one death by suicide \u0026ndash; were unrelated to the shots.” \u003cbr/\u003eWait a second, a lot of these symptoms sound very familiar, don’t they? Perhaps to the side effects of oral contraceptives for women? Which were approved by the FDA in the 1960s? I don’t know about you, but something seems a little fishy around here, and this time it’s not the vagina. \u003cbr/\u003eUnfortunately for now, the reality of another male birth control option does not seem to be “pulling out” anytime soon. But hey, at least we now officially know that our society is still men-centric and women’s health will always be less important in the eyes of the FDA.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Joshua Tree has been deemed one of the strangest places to visit in California, so it makes sense that \u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eMoon Block Party\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e decided to move the growing “anti-coachella” festival from previous locations. The small desert city is known for it’s high desert art galleries, new-age spiritual centers, and a hip and growing music scene. The latest 420-acre venue is a meditative center built by Frank Lloyd Wright, advertised as “a portal to your inner being”, which helped provide Desert Daze with a miraculously otherworldly aesthetic. The spiritually charged atmosphere was complimented by the many interactive art installations, meditative altars tucked away from the crowd, mysterious tents filled with Reiki healers, and the trippy sound of psych-rock penetrating the air.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"827\" data-orig-width=\"1028\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ab42566515462258d5ce9fcf82c135ed/tumblr_inline_ofqxv0GBtj1qhakxc_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"827\" data-orig-width=\"1028\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"731\" data-orig-width=\"975\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f078e583e93b63610a477b3e20c7f60e/tumblr_inline_ofqxzxiOoE1qhakxc_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"731\" data-orig-width=\"975\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDay 1 \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first day of the festival was very different from the rest of the weekend, mostly because the crowd presence was much smaller. Since many people didn’t arrive until Friday night, it was particularly easy to stand next to the stages and be close to the performers without trying to squeeze past anyone. When I watched one of my favorite bands \u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eMild High Club\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e, who gave an amazing performance, there were only about fifty people in the audience. \u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eGary Wilson\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e, pictured below, performed with his band at the same small stage and it was easy to just walk up to the band and have a conversation (they became very offended when I complimented their wigs, saying, “We never wear wigs” in a harsh tone) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the band played, Gary Wilson writhed around on the floor under a plastic tarp holding\nvarious makeup-smeared mannequin heads.This performance was Desert Daze in\nit’s most pure form. Later that day, many other bands such as \u003cb\u003eDeerhunter\u003c/b\u003e, \u003cb\u003eWashed Out, Toro\ny Moi, Suuns, \u003c/b\u003eand \u003cb\u003eKing Gizzard and\nThe Lizard Wizard \u003c/b\u003eplayed on the other two bigger stages. \u003cb\u003eToro Y Moi\u003c/b\u003e played a wonderfully\nenergetic set, but I didn’t end up seeing all of the bands that night because I\ndecided to spend my night in the \u003cb\u003eMystic\nBazaar\u003c/b\u003e. The Bazaar was a healing tent situated next to the camping section.\nThe smell of sage continuously filled the air while the spiritual healers held\nsound baths, performed massages, Reiki healing ceremonies, and Shamanic rituals\nuntil about 3am.\n\n\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"861\" data-orig-width=\"1133\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7506c75a47967a36c580ed3561f1857d/tumblr_inline_ofqxre1lxz1qhakxc_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"861\" data-orig-width=\"1133\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"842\" data-orig-width=\"1055\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2292dc79d99fafd9436bf01da7e3b992/tumblr_inline_ofqxstwn7H1qhakxc_540.png\" data-orig-height=\"842\" data-orig-width=\"1055\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDay 2\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e The second day was of the festival\nwas much livelier, especially since there was a much larger and more excited\ncrowd. \u003cb\u003eCherry Glazerr \u003c/b\u003ewas definitely\none of the crowd’s favorite sets during the day. \u003cb\u003eThee Oh Sees \u003c/b\u003ehit the stage early that evening and delivered a set\nwith limitless energy, probably one of the most intense performances I’ve ever\nwitnessed. \u003cb\u003eThe Black Angels\u003c/b\u003e\n(pictured), the festival’s founder’s very own band \u003cb\u003eJJUJJU, \u003c/b\u003eand \u003cb\u003eNight Beats \u003c/b\u003ewere\nfollowed by Montreal post-rock legends \u003cb\u003eGodspeed\nYou!

My favorite performance during the day was feminist duo \u003cb\u003eDeap Vally \u003c/b\u003ewho had about a dozen\ndancers wearing unicorn and monster costumes on stage while they played a\ncatchy and politically-charged set. Overall, \u003cb\u003eFoxygen \u003c/b\u003e(pictured below) was my favorite band of the night. Even\nthough they took almost an entire hour to soundcheck, the band made up for it\nwith a fun performance with the lead singers dancing and the band playing an\nextremely broad range of instruments. The iconic band \u003cb\u003eTelevision \u003c/b\u003ewas one of the last shows of the night, and ended their\nset playing the cult-favorite \u003cb\u003eMarquee\nMoon\u003c/b\u003e. Overall, Desert Daze was a truly magical experience that I would\nhighly recommend over more commercialized festivals such as Coachella. Even\nthough there were many legendary groups, it still kept a low-key and relaxing\nvibe which made the experience that much more special.

Before the film began, Hart, who right before had an engagement unveiling his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, told the audience that this film was his “baby”, his magnum opus.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI can say, without a doubt, this may have been one of the greatest stand-up specials of all time. The stand-up features a frame story in which Kevin Hart lives out his secret agent fantasy with Halle Berry as his “Bond Girl” only hours before he is due on stage. The stage, by the way, is none other than Lincoln Financial Field, the football stadium in his hometown of Philadelphia. For even daring to pack this many people in one space, Hart broke a few records and began the most successful comedy tour of all time with Billboard clocking in so far at $35 million after only selling 600,000 tickets back in March 2015.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’ve seen Kevin Hart’s previous specials and have finished each hour with tears in my eyes and a pain at my side, \u003ci\u003eWhat Now?\u003c/i\u003edoesn’t disappoint. Kevin Hart touches on his relationship with his then-fiancée, children and father and hanging out with his older friends and getting older himself. Hart, as a seasoned veteran at this point in career, expertly weaves what feels like a continuous story rather than simply telling jokes, starting with a hood ass raccoon and ending with his own inability to make sense of Starbucks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat really took the film to the next level was how prepared he was for this one to be his biggest and best show yet. Giant monitors supported Hart’s jokes with visuals and sounds that aided in his storytelling. An amazing feat of the design of this show is during Hart’s segment on using the airport bathroom when his “stomach told [his] ass” that he needed to get to a restroom immediately. Hart positioned his stool and with the camera trained on him it looked as if he was sitting on a toilet complete with the sounds of the restroom. The entire show featured other moments of Hart seamlessly playing God and turning all the lights on in the stadium with simply a wave of his hand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUltimately, the film was a reminder that Kevin Hart can still kill it with stand-up and everything (except for \u003ci\u003eSoul Plane\u003c/i\u003e) Kevin Hart touches will leave you in stitches.\u003c/p\u003e",

Malvin, who was educated\nin classical percussion began performing as Chrome Sparks while studying at the\nUniversity of Michigan. His musical career took off with the release of the\n2013 stoner anthem “Marijuana” which was later sampled by Jamie XX on “Loud\nPlaces”. The performance at The Echoplex was characterized by loud, pulsing\nbass drums and heavy synthesizers which brought unique elements to the\nelectronic genre.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/63038c17738310f678016370f18c652e/tumblr_inline_oejsqfdj6y1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e The night’s opener was the Australian producer\nRoland Tings, whose set list was deeply rooted in the early UK rave and club\nmusic of the 1990’s. His music featured long buildups filled with\nretro-sounding synths and classic club drum beats. While his music was well\narranged and mixed, it lacked in tonal variety. Much of the set felt like a\nbuildup for the audience who was eagerly awaiting Chrome Sparks to appear. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c074f54448b78db4313dee33597e96e9/tumblr_inline_oejssno7AO1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eChrome Sparks took the stage with\npercussionist Bill DeLelles, both clad in all white, a stark contrast to the\nnear pitch darkness of the venue. Malvin surrounded himself with synthesizers and\nsamplers, all connected to his laptop and Ableton Live. DeLelles sat on a drum\nkit that was also fitted with electronic pads to add depth to the beats. The\nduo was well rehearsed and the music took new life with live drumming and\nkeyboard performances by Chrome Sparks. After a long introduction, the duo\nperformed “The Meaning of Love” which highlighted Malvin’s heavy usage of the vocoder\nand “the octagon”, a custom made octagon-shaped light that flashed different\ncolors and three-dimensional patterns with the beat. The octagon captured the\naudience’s attention and helped transport them into a state of intense musical\nnirvana. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7d05ad2179dc7aed57cd99f1cb06d88d/tumblr_inline_oejsquC7me1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eMalvin and DeLelles performance was\nunlike most other producers. The two used their musical training to improvise\nand take the music to new progressive sounds. The overall tone of the show was\ndifferent than his recorded material; it sounded heavy and psychedelic, as if\nMalvin had met El-P and Trent Reznor while on an acid trip. The intense synths\nwere welcomed by the audience, who danced along to a hypnotic take of “Send the\nPain On”. Chrome Sparks played some newer tracks such as “All or Nothing” which\nwas added to by DeLelle’s drum fills. Malvin closed off the night with a lively\nrendition of “Marijuana”, during which a smoky haze filled the room. The duo\nquickly walked off stage only to shortly return, understanding that the\naudience demanded more. Chrome Sparks played some new material during the\nencore and made use of the seizure-inducing lighting from the stage, which flashed\non and off with the rhythm of each song. At the end of the show, DeLelle walked\noff stage and left Malvin alone with his synthesizers, where he continued to\nplay along to a sustained chord before thanking the audience and exiting the\nstage. The set flowed continuously from its onset, as if Chrome Sparks knew\nthat the audience did not want the performance to end. \u003c/p\u003e",

But often times some of the bands that stick out for you the most are the ones you just happen upon while waiting in line at a food truck for your third serving of the greatest pad thai on the planet. This is a list of some of the not-so-hidden gems I stumbled upon throughout my weekend at ArcTanGent Festival in Bristol, UK (August 18-20).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e5) Vasudeva\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u0009I wasn’t surprised that Vasudeva absolutely killed their set. I’d seen them play a house show in Los Angeles about a year ago and knew they were an undeniably sick act. But from such an intimate environment, I never could have predicted how well their sound would carry from the main stage of a festival. The lyrical guitar lines and heavy reverb filled the space beautifully without ever straying from the tightest of pockets. Their highly technical yet groove-able tunes were a perfect opener for the day and it was a wonderful harbinger to those in the crowd that if this was the quality of music we’d be receiving at 11:30am, the rest of the day was bound to be incredible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e4) The Brackish\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u0009I caught The Brackish’s set immediately after Vasudeva’s and while I had listened to them prior to the festival and was intrigued by their sound, I have to be honest and say that the reason I rushed to their stage was because it had started raining heavily and their stage was less than a kilometer from the main stage (I’m assuming. I still haven’t quite figured out the metric system). I’m sure I wasn’t alone in this reasoning but by the 3rd song, I had forgotten the rain and was totally engrossed and rocking along to their hybrid of tight math rock and free flowing jam-band grooves. While still keeping with the cerebral nature of the genre, they managed to produce a set that was almost nostalgic of the free love and psychedelia festivals of decades past.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e3) Space Blood \u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u0009While several bands throughout the weekend could be noted for their grand displays of showmanship, I have to give the crown to Space Blood. I had listened to the band’s most recent album, Can’t Stop Seeing Creed, which featured Dan Wild-Beesly of Cleft playing guitar on the title track and I was eager to see the song replicated in a live setting. But when the bass and drums duo took the stage wearing masks and blasting confetti cannons into the audience, I knew I was in for something bigger. At a festival where many bands favor a raw, stripped down aesthetic, Space Blood took a more heavily conceptualized approach. In lieu of typical stage banter, all the dialogue in between songs came from a computerized voice who dished out plenty of tongue-in-cheek social commentary (sarcastically praising the “Non-United Kingdom” on their recent Brexit) and space-puns. When Dan entered the stage, he had donned a blonde wig as Boris Johnson and was tasked with several trials including correctly distinguishing a cookie from a biscuit, doing an impression of the Queen, and being successfully “Malort-ed” with the band’s special edition of the infamous Chicago wormwood-tinged liquor. Finally, it was with the powers granted to him by drinking the Malort that he was able to strap on his guitar and join the band in their thumping interstellar space rock. From the heavy jams, to just the right amount of wackiness, to the band’s ability to break the fourth wall at all the right moments, it was clear from the audience reaction that the brainwashing mission was a huge success.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e2) Godspeed You! Black Emperor\u003c/b\u003e \u003cbr/\u003eFriday night’s headliner was the heavily billed Godspeed You! Black Emperor, a highly influential band in the progressive rock genre whose sets are known for their elaborate production and visual component. As one of the most talked about acts of the festival, nothing about Godspeed’s act should have come as a surprise to me. But after months of hearing so much about how astonishing their live performance was, I made the decision not to explore their music prior to the festival so I could go in with fresh eyes and ears to take it all in. This approach ended up working out perfectly. Their set was a beautiful presentation of stunning graphics paired with vast soundscapes, the audio and visual mediums continuously feeding into one another without one ever overshadowing the other. Their 8-piece arrangement was the perfect musical centerpiece and matched the cinematic scale of the epic displays on the stage. Going back now and exploring the albums on their own continues to deepen my respect for the band and the high level of artistry they put into everything they do, for as different an experience it is to hear the music without the accompanying film, it is obvious that the music and its story are not dependent on visuals and can easily stand alone as a true work of art.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"568\" data-orig-height=\"561\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b3aaf2ed0036efd906f42aea8c6f95fa/tumblr_inline_odew25sQc01qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"568\" data-orig-height=\"561\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e1) Plini \u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009In a way, my experience with Plini’s set encompassed the entire ArcTanGent experience. For as breathtaking as GY!BE’s performance was, when a Facebook-acquaintance-turned-concert-buddy suggested we leave halfway through to catch Plini, I decided to join her. Since I’d assumed that I would be spending the entire evening glued to the main stage, I hadn’t researched Plini at all so once again I was going in with zero context or expectations. And once again, it paid off big time. Right away, seeing Plini and his bassist both walk out with Strandberg headless guitars was an indicator that this would be a performance unlike anything else I had witnessed at the festival thus far. When the music first began, I was immediately blown away by the purity of his guitar sound. Just as beautiful as the melodies he was playing was the thick, shining tone by which the melodies were being carried. Equally exciting for me was the crunchy yet bright tone of his bassist, who also thrilled throughout the set by exhibiting many virtuosic displays of tapping on his own 5-string Strandberg. The music was an excellent demonstration of math-jazz fusion in its truest form. Aside from some crucial swells and several moments of insane time-bending drumming, the music wasn’t aggressive. Whether it was through his melodic lines, his phrasing, or just his stance at center stage, Plini was never without his swagger. The set as a whole was magnetic and he seemed a bit shocked at times by the energy and depth of his audience, even reminding the crowd at one point that the headliner was performing at the other end of the festival. But, as I’m sure every person at that stage had realized, there was no such thing as bad bands at ArcTanGent and literally any band at any time of day could blow you away if you just stop and take a listen.\u003c/p\u003e",

TTNG (formerly known as This\nTown Needs Guns), while existing since 2004, have truly come into their own\nwith their most recent release, \u003ci\u003eDisappointment Island.  \u003c/i\u003eThis is something I’ve\nsaid about every record they’ve released since I first heard 2008’s\n\u003ci\u003eAnimals, \u003c/i\u003eso take it with a grain of salt, but I stand by it. The current\nincarnation of the band, consisting of brothers Chris and Tim Collis, as well\nas Henry Tremain (who joined the band before their 2013 release, \u003ci\u003e13.0.0.0.0\u003c/i\u003e)\nconveniently came along with the transition in band names. And with \u003ci\u003eDisappointment\nIsland, \u003c/i\u003ethey’ve shown that not only are they far beyond\ntalented as musicians, but that the talent is merely a channel for expression\nof their human existence. Because while they do things with their instruments\nthat seem completely inhuman at times to the ears of a fellow musician, as a\nperson you can’t help but to be overwhelmed with both empathy for the\nstruggles presented in the lyrics and the beauty in those struggles, framed\nimpeccably by instrumentation that is at once intricate and mathematic, yet at\nthe same time vulnerable and elegant. On the newest album, it feels like we’re\nseeing Hank’s lyricism grow into something even more honest and vivid,\nand while there is no shortage of odd time signatures and impossible guitar\nriffs, the music works cohesively to serve the emotion. The opening track, \u003ci\u003eConsoling\nGhosts, \u003c/i\u003eis a motivational speech to oneself through the process of writing\nmusic, as Hank sings: “Option paralysis stole your time, if\nyou don’t decide you’ll fall behind, do you realize this is\nbigger than you?” and “The worlds likely\nhave less merit than the timbre of their sound, so say anything you feel like,\nand don’t let it get you down.” The\nsong is a signal of Hank’s struggle to break down the walls\nseparating his emotional self and the music shared by fans around the world.\nAnd by the end of this first track, he’s effectively convinced himself that,\nfor better or worse, it’s best to let the words and feelings\nfall out, and so ensues the rest of the album. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e            Through\nponderings of life events as heavy as the suicide of a loved one to frustrations\nwith thinking patterns and unconditional loneliness, he maintains a forward\nprogress, not shying away from questions that only raise more questions and\ninquiring into those brought up by the ones he asks.  Investigating the biology at the root of the\nemotions he feels, and making peace with the human condition is the drive that\npushes this album forward. Tremain searches for the evolutionary roots of\ndepression and the roots of the search for happiness on songs like \u003ci\u003eBliss\nQuest\u003c/i\u003e. A few times on the album, the band builds and then breaks into\npowerful distorted guitars, something that hasn’t been seen as much\nsince songs like \u003ci\u003eIt\u003c/i\u003e\u003ci\u003e’s not true rufus, don\u003c/i\u003e\u003ci\u003e’t\nlisten to the hat \u003c/i\u003efrom the band’s self-titled album, providing an\nintense emotional release from lyrical topics as draining as existential\nconfusion on \u003ci\u003eSponkulus Nodge, \u003c/i\u003eor the frustration of falling in and out\nof depression on \u003ci\u003eWhatever, Whenever, \u003c/i\u003ewhere the cathartic resolve at the\nend of the song exchanges showing emotion through lyricism for an intense,\npurely instrumental build-up followed by an explosion of wide, overdriven\nguitars. TTNG experiments with a multitude of sounds on this record that are\nsomewhat new to them, yet they employ them masterfully, such as the tremolo\nguitar break on \u003ci\u003eIn Praise of Idlenesss, \u003c/i\u003eproof that you can get down on a\ngrove in a song that is entirely emotionally vunerable. The band puts the\nrhythm section in the forefront on the song \u003ci\u003eDestroy the Tabernacle!,\u003c/i\u003e\nshowcasing a gritty bass tone that we’ve gotten glimpses of on songs like \u003ci\u003e13.0.0.0.0\u003c/i\u003e\u003ci\u003e’s\nLeft Aligned, \u003c/i\u003ebut never quite to this extent, where the band channels the\nsounds of bands like The Mars Volta, bursting into a 5/4 breakdown that is\nnothing short of badass.\u003ci\u003e \u003c/i\u003eOn \u003ci\u003eEmpty Palms, \u003c/i\u003e the album’s closing track,\nwhere Hank sings “Two holding hands now halved, two\nempty palms apart. It’s best we part, I am broken and no\ngood for you,” before dropping out and letting the resolve of the sparkling\nguitar riff leading into the full band playing in unison at a tempo that\ncarries the listener and the band forward, allowing us to reflect on the\nnever-ending nature of the questions asked by the album, and also to be aware\nof the beauty in being able to ask the questions themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2448\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/691f6f58e3607ecbbcd898418c10fe14/tumblr_inline_ob7e3qoQqW1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2448\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e            I was fortunate\nenough to be able to see TTNG play the Teragram Ballroom on July 22, and the\nsongs played from the new album translated seemingly effortlessly to a live\nsetting. The band’s often bleak lyrics were in no way\nindicative of their demeanor between songs, as they were constantly cheery,\nbringing a necessary sense of lightness to the atmosphere. While they were sure\nto play plenty of songs from the newest record, which were received by the\naudience as if they had been songs known for years, they were also sure to play\nfavorites from each of their releases. Highlights included tracks like \u003ci\u003eBaboon,\nI\u003c/i\u003e\u003ci\u003e’ll Take The Minute Snake, \u003c/i\u003eand \u003ci\u003eWant to come back to my\nroom and listen to some Belle and Sebastian, \u003c/i\u003ebut the true climax of the\nshow came with the encore, when the band played the leading track from their\nself-titled debut, \u003ci\u003e26 is dancier than 4. \u003c/i\u003eHank warned the crowd before\nthat “this song is very hard to play, so we apologize if we mess\nup,” before breaking into a near-flawless performance of the\nsong, which is not only one of the band’s most technically impressive, but one\nthat is sure to wet every eye that was still dry in the venue. With their\nlatest release and tour, TTNG has shown that they are at the top of their game,\nand are showing no signs of letting up any time soon.\u003c/p\u003e",

Every devoted disciple must make the pilgrimage to Bristol at least once. As someone who dedicates an hour every week to blasting my favorite math and prog jams across the interwaves, it’s a trip I was beyond excited to make and you can be sure I spent excessive amounts of time exploring every band on the lineup. While I discovered plenty of new favorite bands at the festival, there were definitely bands I was already familiar with that I knew I couldn’t miss. In conjunction with my other list \u003ca href=\"http://uclaradio.tumblr.com/post/150327655932/top-5-most-surprising-acts-at-arctangent\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e, this list could be nicknamed “Least Surprising Acts at ArcTanGent” because they were bands I had sought out early on and knew would totally blow me away (that said, there were still plenty of fun surprises to be had).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNote: Obviously with a festival lineup as deep as ArcTanGent’s, there are so many more acts I was looking forward to seeing and who blew me away than I have space to discuss. For this reason, I’m omitting many of the festival’s headlining acts from this list in order to give way to some of the lesser-known acts. So while American Football, Three Trapped Tigers, And So I Watch You From Afar and others may not be listed below, let it be known that they were not only highly anticipated leading up to the festival, but that they wildly surpassed all expectations and gave unforgettable performances that I’m thankful to have been able to witness. I’m also leaving off TTNG, even though they were one of the highlights of Day 1, since I already published a review for the opening night of their US tour last month (\u003ca href=\"http://uclaradio.tumblr.com/post/148114631247/show-review-ttng-thee-parkside-san-francisco\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecan be read here\u003c/a\u003e) However, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t check out my interview with them \u003ca href=\"http://uclaradio.tumblr.com/post/150733906947/interview-getting-geeky-with-ttng-arctangent\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e5) Bearded Youth Quest\u003cbr/\u003e\u0009My excitement to see Bearded Youth Quest on the Bixler stage was ignited earlier this year the first time I heard the opening yell of “Banana Flip-flop”, an electrifying jam with a title derived from the rhythm of the song’s opening riff. As their name suggests, the band is a fairly young group who are clearly on a quest to deliver fun, energetic guitar-driven math rock to the masses. There was never a dull moment in their set and even the most complex sections of their songs were never without lightness and joy. Whether it’s on their album or the festival stage, the group sounds primarily like a bunch of guys in a room trying to write songs that everyone can get excited about. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e4) Floral\u003cbr/\u003e\u0009Unlike most of the other bands on this list, my anticipation for Floral’s set wasn’t because I had never seen them live before. It was because I had seen them live many times and couldn’t wait to see how they would do on the festival stage. As someone who’s known the band for many years, seeing their first tour culminate on such a monumental stage was really special. The set was everything anyone could hope for. The band brought their usual energy and tight jams with some special surprises and additions to match the grand scale of the venue they were playing. It was the longest set I’d seen them play, which was definitely a treat. They were even joined onstage by a hat juggler during one of their songs. Just as exciting as the performance itself was the audience’s reaction. When I arrived at the PX3 stage, the crowd had already overflowed far beyond the reaches of the tarp covering the stage. Regardless of their familiarity or proximity to the band, everyone in the crowd was eagerly transfixed on the music. In talking with other festival goers following Floral’s set, it seemed like at least half of the people who had witnessed the set were previously unfamiliar with the band, but all had been blown away and genuinely enjoyed what they’d heard. \u003cbr/\u003e (\u003ca href=\"http://uclaradio.tumblr.com/post/150619104607/floral-talk-uk-tour-arctangent-festival-2016\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRead my interview with the band about their UK tour here\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003e3) Town Portal\u003cbr/\u003e\u0009The word I use to describe myself whenever I see Town Portal live is one I hardly use under any other circumstances: giddy. I don’t know if it’s being able to dance to such a fat and gritty bass tone or some other ineffable quality that peaks my math rock geekiness to such obscenely high levels, but for whatever reason, I simply couldn’t keep from smiling throughout their entire set. They are one of the truest three-piece bands I’ve experienced, for while each member will individually stun you in every song, the music is never dominated by a single instrument or personality. Although each musician’s part is not without its complexities and asymmetricalities, the music as a whole is always rock solid. What made me most ecstatic about Town Portal’s set was finding out that their grooves sound just as heavy live as they do on their albums, but much louder and with the added bonus of being able to share in the excitement of all the other people who’re just as thrilled to be there as you are. The band must have caught onto some of this joy partway through their set, for they asked the audience to form a “hopscotch circle”, which was essentially a mosh pit except everyone was just skipping in circles, during one of their songs.  It would be a strange request coming from most other bands, but for this group the crowd was more than happy to oblige.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2) toe\u003cbr/\u003eSeeing as math and music are both universal and without cultural barriers, it makes perfect sense that math rock is a highly diverse genre that can be traced all around the world. That said, there are few countries that have provided the world with the same volume of stellar math rock bands that Japan has. Ask anyone about the Japanese math rock scene and they’re bound to mention toe as one of the top bands the country has produced. Plain and simple, they are legendary among the math rock elite. Back when I was first discovering the genre, I had multiple friends mentioning toe as an essential band to look up. This was in large part because of the band’s drummer, Kashikura Takashi, whose drum parts are both the anchor and the driving force behind the band’s music. With plenty of varying electric and acoustic instrumental textures from one song to the next, Takashi’s complex rhythmic patterns are immediately recognizable and firmly place the band on the top tier of math rock that defies the misguided stereotype of being purely mechanical and without feeling, paired expertly with melodic guitar lines that are of the highest technique yet still feel organic. Experiencing their music live in the purest form was exhilarating and definitely a huge item on my concert bucket list.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"816\" data-orig-height=\"482\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/458398bf5ef4b4e6ef3ffbad2b32c3ea/tumblr_inline_oe2qzeWXrn1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"816\" data-orig-height=\"482\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e1) Cleft\u003cbr/\u003e\u0009When Cleft took the stage for their last ever show on Friday afternoon, they were greeted like rock stars. From the first note they played, they made it clear that they would be leaving everything out on the stage. The reception from the crowd showed that they too knew that this was going to be a very special show for everyone involved. The setlist featured both old and new songs, all of which had been chosen by fans in a Facebook poll prior to the festival. Dan Wild-Beesley’s already bulging guitar tone was further amplified by the electricity that ran through the audience, which in turn fed into the thundering energy and precision of John Simm’s drumming. To put it plainly, I have never heard such an enthusiastic singalong at an instrumental concert. Fans were singing along to complex mathy guitar lines like they were the outro of “Hey Jude”. There were even moments when Dan would omit playing certain phrases, unable to compete with the volume and vigor of the crowd. If there had been no festival and this had been the only concert I’d seen, it would still be one of the greatest shows I’ve ever witnessed. The emotions were high, the love was real, and the music was heavy as hell. The set was riddled with surprises and guest appearances from other members of the math rock community, with Ben Forrester of Bad Grammar filling in on vocals on the track “Elephant In The Bar Room”. The band saved the best surprise for last, closing the show with a medley of Motörhead, Prince, and David Bowie which was joined by Nick Duke of Trojan Horse on vocals and Tom Peters, guitarist of Alpha Male Tea Party. It was an emotional ending to say the least and while it was still very sad to see this band walk off for the last time, I will forever be grateful to have been present at such a poignant moment in the band’s, and the festival’s, history.\u003cbr/\u003e(\u003ca href=\"http://uclaradio.tumblr.com/post/151015591414/talking-tangents-and-fond-farewells-with-dan\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYou can read my conversation with Dan Wild-Beesley about Cleft’s final show here\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003c/p\u003e",

With one of the most tumultuous\nsummers in recent years, fans of the English top flight have been left with a\nnumber of burning questions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow will Leicester City fare?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e            Leicester\nCity shocked the world last year, when Claudio Raineri led the Foxes to their\nfirst and only top flight title. They won the league by playing a pragmatic yet\nbeautiful counter attacking style. Leicester have had a melancholic summer amid\ntransfer rumors surrounding Jamie Vardy, Riyad Mahrez, and N’golo Kante. While\nVardy and Mahrez remain in Leicester for now, Kante joined Chelsea for £30\nmillion. The Foxes loss to Hull City this past weekend illustrated how Kante’s\nloss will affect Leicester. Without Kante acting as the engine of their\nmidfield, they looked vulnerable in the middle. Drinkwater especially looked\nout of place without his usual midfield partner. Although Leicester bought\nAhmed Musa, who should provide a lot to the team if he can gel well with Vardy,\nthey haven’t added much depth to their thin squad. The additional Champions\nLeague matches will take their toll on the Foxes and cost them some domestic\nsuccess. Fortunately for Leicester, they have Claudio Raneiri at the helm. With\nRaneiri’s quality, I expect Leicester to finish anywhere from 6\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e to\n10\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e depending on how the Foxes deal with the added pressures of\nEuropean football.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c!-- more --\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow will Manchester United’s high\nprofile signings perform?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e            In\nJuly, the Red Devils signed Zlatan Ibrahimovic, one of the most prolific\nstrikers in the world. The next day, they bought Henrikh Mkhitarayan, the\nBundesliga Players’ Player of the Season, from Borussia Dortmund. A month\nlater, Manchester United overshadowed both of these impressive additions by\nsigning Paul Pogba for a world record £89.3 million. At times last year\nManchester United were lamented as a boring side that lacked creativity. With\nthe addition of these three players and Jose Mourinho as the new manager, the\nMancs will be anything but boring. Mkhitarayan, at least on paper, should be\nable to make a seamless transition to Premier League having previously played in\nthe similarly physical Bundesliga. Furthermore, Mkhitarayan thrived under\nDortmund’s direct play, which should help him adapt to Mourinho’s infamous\ncounter attacking tactics. Mourinho helped develop Hazard into one of the best\nwingers in the world and I have no doubts that he can do the same for\nMkhitarayan. Zlatan Ibrahimovic, like Mkhitarayan, has the tools to play well\nin England. On Sunday, Ibrahimovic had a dream debut against Bournemouth,\nscoring from 25 yards out. He has the physicality to deal with the toughest\ntacklers in the league, while he also has the technical skills to create goals\nfor himself. Unless his age finally catches up to him, I fully expect\nIbrahimovic to bag around 20 goals and a few assists. Despite being perhaps the\nmost hyped of Manchester United’s recent arrivals, I believe Paul Pogba will\ninitially struggle to adapt to life in the Premier League. Despite starting\nmost game for Euro 2016 runners-up France, his performances were relatively\nanonymous and hardly representative of his price tag. Pogba performs best as an\nadvanced midfielder, but Mourinho, like Didier Deschamps, may choose to play\nhim in a deeper midfield role. I expect Paul Pogba to start his Manchester\nUnited with a bang, scoring a screamer, but then hitting a bad midseason slump.\nManchester United fans have nothing to worry about though as Pogba is still\njust 23 and can only improve. United paid for his potential rather than his\ncurrent quality. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan the three newly promoted clubs\navoid relegation?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e            Middlesbrough,\nHull City, and Burnley all returned to Premier League action. While\nMiddlesbrough haven’t been in the top flight since 2009, Hull City and Burnley\nhave developed into yo-yo clubs that are constantly relegated and promoted.\nMiddlesbrough have made a statement of intent by bringing in some big names\nlike Alvaro Negredo and Victor Valdes who boast international experience and\nquality. Additionally, Gaston Ramirez and Stewart Downing, know the ins and\nouts of the Premier League and will seamlessly transition to life in the top\nflight. Out of the three promoted teams, Middlesbrough have the strongest side\non paper and should be able to steer clear of relegation if they perform to\ntheir ability. Hull City, on the other hand, look sure favorites to go right\nback down to the Championship. Although they managed to beat Leicester on the\nopening day, Hull City only had 13 available players. Furthermore, the club is\nin the process of being sold and doesn’t have a manager. Without any semblance\nof stability on or off the field, Hull will find it difficult to survive the\nPremier League. Burnley will also struggle this season in the Premier League\ndue to simple lack of quality. Besides George Boyd, the team reeks of\nmediocrity. Sam Vokes and Andre Gray formed a formidable strike partnership\nlast year in the Championship, but I’m not convinced they have the quality to\nperform in the Premier League. They couldn’t create many chances in their\ndefeat against Swansea City on Saturday.

Is it raining where you are? \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTK : Actually, I am in Palm Springs so it’s nice and clear right now but I think it’s meant to be raining this weekend. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eOh I am so jealous. So to be clear you are the creative director for the “Be Kind” festival? \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTK: That is correct I am the artistic director and creative marketing director of the “Be Kind” festival. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWow, and how old are you? I know that you recently celebrated a birthday. \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTK: Yeh, I just turned 20.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow were you able to get this opportunity at such a young age? What was your backstory for such a deal for you? \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTK: I’ve been doing music my whole life and went to school for jazz and piano performance. I play about thirteen different instruments and I got into NYU after graduating but decided to dropped out after six months because I didn’t like it too much. Then, I started interning. At the internship, I learned about producing which led me to link up with other artists in the LA area. This made me move back to LA where I started producing, making money, and getting placements on records. Somehow I end up meeting Mike Tyson on a boat with a family friend. Mike mentioned his son who is sixteen is an aspiring musician so we linked up and had a great vibe.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eThat’s interesting, and what led from that point? \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTK: It turns out Mike wanted to throw a music festival to launch his cannabis company called “Tyson Ranch.” Next thing you know I am in the Tyson ranch office and they wanted my input because I was experienced with social media and well connected in LA. I guess they needed a millennial opinion on the festival since the audience they wanted was within our age and college kids. [laughs] After that moment I got full fledged involved and worked my way up to the artistic director of the whole thing. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAll this before the age of 20, congratulations. To my knowledge, this going to be the first all-ages CBD festival am I right?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTK:  Yeah, we are saluting California’s progressive stance on cannabis and how it is used for recreational and medicinal. The brand of the festival is not to do with cannabis or CBD but more to do with kindness, that\u0026rsquo;s why it is called kind music festival. We want to focus on unity, kindness, and bringing people together. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eI hear that. So when is the festival?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTK: It’s going to be down here in Palm Springs, CA and that’s why I am down here. We are getting football fields of astro turf laid down to do this festival, but the event is going to be on February 23rd. It’s a one day opening pop-up event that can be considered a micro-festival. We have A$AP Ferg and Miguel headlining it\u0026rsquo;s going to be a good time and we have plenty of activities at the festival. There will be a surprise at the festival that will mark the opening of our brand and Kind music festival. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSounds like a great time. How has it been working with Mike and the whole crew, what can you tell us about your experiences?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTK: Mike Tyson is a legend, everyone always says you can go anywhere in the world and people will know three names Mickey Mouse, Michael Jackson, and Mike Tyson.  He’s really the face of boxing ever since Muhammad Ali passed. Its crazy every day being surrounded by these people who come into the office, like we had Diplo last week. It\u0026rsquo;s a crazy experience getting all this at such a young age and being around this caliber of people. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eDo you see yourself in the future being someone like Tariq? Rolling Louds co-founder?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTK: This festival in a couple of years is going to be another Rolling Loud or hopefully down the road turn into something as large as Coachella. So I definitely think I will hopefully be one of those names in the future. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow much of a reference did you use of Rolling Loud for the Kind Fest?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTK: What we\u0026rsquo;re doing is very different but it\u0026rsquo;s still a music festival, so it is obviously going to be inherent things that are similar to other music festivals. I grew up going to Coachella as a local of the Coachella Valley so that\u0026rsquo;s one of my really big influences. Everyone knows that Coachella is probably one of the craziest music festivals in the world. They do an insanely good job doing the marketing to millennials and influencers and kids who are apart of our generation, so that\u0026rsquo;s obviously apart of my inspiration but what we\u0026rsquo;re doing is next level. Nothing that we’re doing has been done before. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat kind of treats can we expect at the Kind Festival?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTK: There\u0026rsquo;s a lot that you can expect. We do have some fortune 500 companies that will be involved as far as sponsorships and stuff so you will see a lot of cool brands. A lot of stuff that is not normal for a music festival as far as creating an experience as opposed to just a festival. There’s going to be a ton of activities to do around the grounds such as theme park kind of feels and a lot of interactive stuff that you can do. And we have a huge surprise that\u0026rsquo;s going to be a part of it, so you gotta see for yourself or wait till the footage to come out because we’re selling out pretty quick. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eTalk about the lineup, how did that work out? \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTK: There are so many hip hop and EDM festivals nowadays so we wanted to tune it pack and make it a relaxed vibe at least for this first one. We do have that hip hop representative, with ASAP Ferg, a hip hop legend, but we wanted to make the headline vibe relaxed which is why we have Miguel. October we’re going have the full festival so as soon as this pop-up event ends February 23rd, we\u0026rsquo;re going to start working a week after for the one in October multiple days, multiple stages. It’s going to be huge. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHow is this February fest going to differ from the one in October?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTK: It\u0026rsquo;s going to be bigger and better. Every year it’s just going to get bigger and better. Longer, more acts, and crazy headliners for the one in October. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSo how do you think having more festivals besides Coachella is going to affect the community?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTK: Well I feel like we’re going to have a lot more kids running around, and I feel like that’s good for the valley, progressive. It’s good to have stuff that kids do because all these people come and retire here and they have kids and grandkids. Kids growing up don’t have a lot to do out here besides throwing house parties or… that’s pretty much it, you know? Other than Coachella every year, they really have nothing to do. Mike is building an entertainment complex so there’s going to be a lot of stuff that’s going to start catering to the younger audience. Hopefully, we see a shift to a community that revolves more around the future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eYeah, ok so when you say ‘entertainment complex’ what does that mean exactly?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTK: Yeah, the Tyson Ranch is building an entertainment complex, CDB research facility, an arena for concerts year-round in the desert, a luxury glamping site\u0026ndash;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eLuxury glamping? I love it!\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTK: Yeah, a waterpark, lazy river, pool, all types of stuff, so it’s gonna be insane.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAlright, so give us a re-cap again about what we can expect at the festival\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTK: Alright yeah, so at the festival, it’s gonna be a really great time, you can expect ASAP Ferg, Ric La Flare, Miguel will be there, a bunch of other acts and a bunch of other entertainment and activities that you’re gonna be able to do. It’s February 23rd, it’s a pop-up concert, it’s gonna be a good time down in Palm Springs 2-11pm, all ages, bring friends, bring family. I have a discount code for you guys it’s BEKIND, all caps, you get thirty dollars off your ticket and it goes down to like fifty dollars. Fifty dollars for all that good time, it’s a no-brainer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eYeah, it’s a no-brainer. So, how can we put that in? What website?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTK: it’s \u003ca href=\"http://www.kindmusicfestival.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.kindmusicfestival.com\u003c/a\u003e you scroll down to a pink button it says ‘tickets’, it’ll take you to Front Gate tickets site, that’s by Ticketmaster and there’s a discount option at the bottom, put in BEKIND, all caps, and just proceed to checkout and it’ll apply that discount in for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003ePerfect, well I know I’ll be there.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTK: Well I’ll be there too! I’m actually performing with one of the acts there, so I’ll see you guys on the main stage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eYou’re performing?!\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTK: Yeahhh\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhat will you be doing?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTK: I’ll be performing with Yonnie, he’s an artist that I produced for, so I’ll be back there doing a bunch of the background instruments so, it’s gonna be a good time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eOh tight, congrats! Break a leg.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTK: [laughs] Hopefully not, it can get real serious on that stage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eOk, well we’ll see you on that stage at the Be Kind Festival. Thank you for tuning in, thank you TK for calling in.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTK: Thanks Mahala, you’re the best!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"1109\" data-orig-width=\"1125\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/edb4626b5e363e305d06d4c8cd45bdf3/tumblr_inline_pn5foowU2F1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"1109\" data-orig-width=\"1125\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eYeah, alright.

    "title": "Ranking the Songs Nominated for Best Original Song at the 2019 Oscars",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003earticle by Mark McGreal\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the 91st Academy Awards fast approaching the movie world is abuzz. Questions are being posed such as “What will the awards looks like without a host?” and “Which film is going to win best picture?” and “Is the person who wins for sound editing REALLY going to talk for 5 minutes?!?!?”. While we won’t know the answer to any of these question until February 24, it’s always fun to do a little guessing, ranking, and arguing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Best Original Song category has five nominees that each have a shot at the little golden man, and, since it takes about 20 minutes to listen to all of them versus the approximately 20 hours it takes to watch all of the Best Picture nominees, I’ve decided to give you my prediction on which song will be taking home Oscar gold later in the month.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt should be noted that none of these songs are bad. Even the worst Oscar-nominated song is better than a fair amount of songs released in any particular year. Its like ice cream. Vanilla is no one’s favorite ice cream flavor, but it beats garlic flavored ice cream by a mile. It should also be noted that I’m ranking these songs based on my own opinion, tastes, and gut feelings after listening to the songs. You might have a different opinion, I just happen to be a writer for a blog. So, without further ado, coming in at number five is\u0026hellip;..\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e5. The Place Where Lost Things Go (Mary Poppins Returns)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’d like to start by saying that I absolutely adore Emily Blunt. She’s a terrific actress, funny in interviews, and her husband was on The Office. Oh yeah, and she’s an excellent singer. She previously appeared in Into the Woods (2014) where she showed off her pipes as The Baker’s Wife. She does a great job with this song as well, showing off her range and ability to carry a show tune. Overall, her performance was good. The song itself is the problem. It’s slow, methodical, and a little boring to be honest. Blunt does her best with it, but unless you have children or an unbridled passion for musicals, you probably won’t be bumping this song on your car’s stereo anytime soon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e4. When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings (The Ballad of Buster Scruggs)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eFull disclosure, I fully expected to hate this song. I can’t stand country music (apologies to any of you country fans reading this). I don’t like the genre and I’m not a big fan of westerns in general. This, of course, is not your ordinary western. The newest Coen Brothers film is a Netflix original and has been getting rave reviews. The film itself is built like a six-part anthology, following different stories in the old west. The song is very country. It\u0026rsquo;s slow, the singers have the trademark twang to their voices, and the acoustic guitar is prevalent, but the lyrics are poignant and the song has a certain intrigue to it. Extra points were given for Tim Blake Nelson’s performance on the song. Nelson plays the eponymous character and is probably best known for his role Dr. Pendanski in the Disney classic Holes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e3. I’ll Fight (RBG)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAcademy Award winner Jennifer Hudson collaborated with ten-time Academy Award nominee Diane Warren to create the theme for the documentary about Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the second woman ever elected to the Supreme Court. The song is an anthem for those people who feel oppressed or overlooked, and Hudson’s performance gives the song so much power and nuance. In another year, it might have won Warren her first Oscar. Unfortunately, the category is just too strong this year, and it appears Warren will be 0 for 10 in the Oscar Category.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e2. All the Stars (Black Panther)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst off, I’d like to say that it’s good to see a comic book movie receiving nominations for major awards that don’t have to do with visual effects. As a proud nerd and comic book geek, I appreciate the representation. The song has received a decent amount of radio play, SZA’s voice is excellent and Kendrick lays down another top-notch verse. The song does get a bit repetitive as it goes on, and the beat can be a bit annoying as it continues over and over, but it is one of only two songs being played at the awards this year so that has to count for something.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd that brings us to number one. And the Oscar (probably) goes to\u0026hellip;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e1. Shallow (A Star is Born)\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBradley Cooper’s directorial debut and Lady Gaga’s first lead role in a film coincided to deliver an above average remake of a classic film. Yes, I say above average. The movie isn’t great. The characters are semi one dimensional and if you pay close attention to the background for the first 5-8 minutes of the movie, you can guess the ending. It’s an okay film that is nominated for best picture because of its song. Shallow is great. Bradley Cooper is a surprisingly decent singer, and his performance should be commended. But Lady Gaga. Wow. Of course, I knew that she had singing talent, but the things she does with her voice are unbelievable. She and Mark Ronson put together a spectacular song that played into both her and Cooper’s strengths. Her vibrato is unmatched, and I think she deserves this award more than any other candidate in the field. (Side Note: bet anyone and everyone you know that she is going to burst into tears when she wins. She does it every time without fail. It’s like she doesn’t realize she’s talented.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd that wraps up the list. Tune in ABC to watch the Academy Awards on February 24th at 5 pm.  \u003c/p\u003e",

The choice to cover DEVO seems pointed in that the entirety of the EP feels largely a reflection of the current political climate. Do you feel parallels between the time in which DEVO erupted and now? Do you feel that man as a whole is in a state of de-evolution and how does this affect your perception of yourself? Do you see this as escapable or just as something that can be delayed?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTP: Yeah, I suppose so. DEVO started out during the Nixon administration and it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be hard to find some parallels between him and Trump. That was also during a kind of hangover from the hippie generation but that\u0026rsquo;s not something we have in common. I do feel like people are de-evolving. At least public discourse is. Our president was trying to convince people that he had a big dick during a nationally televised debate. People still voted for him.

For example, I think that Woody Allen has made movies that say some really interesting things about relationships and the human experience but I can\u0026rsquo;t watch his stuff without thinking about what a creep he is. It ruins the movies. That’s just how it is. I guess it\u0026rsquo;s a good thing that people now know more about the artist\u0026rsquo;s they idolize.

On November 15, 2018, talented young recording artist Lucy Downes released her first original single “Wasted Time,” produced and composed by Tyven Gabriner. The “ambient” indie-rock track will make you feel all kinds of melancholy in the sweetest ways. A soft, simple instrumental highlights Downes’ extraordinary voice as she questions the nature of communication, moderation, growth, and change\u0026hellip; asking, what do we do with all this fucking time? When the chorus hits, get ready to be wrenched: her voice floods in like running water, like the deepest blue of the night sky. (The celestial harmonies are a reminder of Downes’ background in the San Francisco Girls Chorus.) On hearing the song for the first time, my mom stopped the car in the middle of the road and said “Wow.” Say “wow” yourself and stream “Wasted Time” on \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/i-3music-11/wasted-time\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSoundcloud\u003c/a\u003e!

Like most people even vaguely involved in the music industry, I think the music that I like is greater than all and love nothing more than getting people out to shows and helping them find their way on the path to finally realizing that my taste is ultimately better than theirs, so a cheap show by a band featuring some of my favorite musicians seemed to be the perfect opportunity to do this. With Ex-Cult’s Chris Shaw on vocals, Ty Segall and Charles Moothart sharing drums and guitar, and recently “officially” added bassist Michael Anderson, GØGGS is a breeding ground for good music. Their latest release Pre Strike Sweep proves that while all four members have other projects (even with one another), GØGGS is more than just as it is often labeled as “one of hundreds of Ty’s bands,” but is a distinctive and necessary project.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"853\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/740b5234b4e33f3382ca1b8955a5e646/tumblr_inline_pl8mlq7tn91qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"853\" data-orig-height=\"1280\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe day of the show I checked in with my friend to see what time we wanted to leave at and realized that doors were at 5 PM, music started at 6 and had a hard deadline to end by 7. Being that we were on the westside and traffic was starting to peak we realized we had to leave right then if we wanted to catch their set. We arrived a little before 6 after trekking a few blocks by foot through the rain and when we came inside, they had already started. Their manager had emailed me that day, letting me know they were not allowing cameras which was disheartening until I realized that ditching my camera meant I could let myself fall into the pit and come out drenched in not only my own but also the sweat of all the strangers I’d bump into. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"853\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/eb908205c08de1a88d4c11be6c3b73f6/tumblr_inline_pl8mnuu2bR1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"853\" data-orig-height=\"1280\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile their set lived up to the bar set by their past performances, I was disappointed with the crowd. There was a strict dividing line between the people in the back wearing hoodies, crossing their arms as they banged their heads to the beat, and the pit that was filled with mostly teenage boys (likely because unlike most people who have jobs, they have no obligations at 6 PM on a Wednesday night) who while jittery with energy, have not yet grounded their footing on how to mosh in a way that isn’t uncomfortably dry humping whoever is standing in front of them. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"939\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5b7617c3487e28f38f0d67182ae68b7c/tumblr_inline_pl8mofgg0f1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"939\" data-orig-height=\"1280\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere were a few moments of aggression that opened up an uncomfortably large pit considering the small number of people jumping into it. Songs like “Falling In” that almost force everyone to move made even the sulky men who lurk in the back refusing to express that they have ever felt any emotion catch themselves no longer leaning against the bar. The show ended a good deal before 7 and I left feeling sort of unfulfilled. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"853\" data-orig-height=\"1280\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6fffb41261a9569db5cc1345fa2cfe5b/tumblr_inline_pl8mosRfaH1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"853\" data-orig-height=\"1280\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile their performance was painfully good with Shaw dragging himself across the stage, Anderson frighteningly still while playing with energy and aggression, Segall periodically looking to the ceiling in ecstasy, and the movement of Moothart’s hair making him hard to ignore, the energy of a crowd can make or break a show.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"853\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5f22c16d210c4b6c27b6409a969782ef/tumblr_inline_pl8mpcG4j81qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1280\" data-orig-height=\"853\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

From what you can tell, how do these influences surface in your music?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUh, I think there’s a lot of different artists… I try not to think about other artists when I’m making my own music. But I like a lot of different genres, my dad listened to lots of jazz so I think there’s elements of that in my music. I listened to a lot of singer-songwriters when I was still in my teens, people like Neil Young and Joni Mitchell and Nick Drake–kind of classic, sorta songsmith-type people…. Increasingly now I listen to more kind of atmospheric stuff. I think from working with Bullion my producer, coming from more of like an electronic background, that’s obviously something that’s been seeping into the music as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSince releasing the Harvard EP you’ve undergone a pretty rapid sonic transition in just a few short years. It seems like you’ve moved away from a folky acoustic set-up and have begun producing more atmospheric, electronic music….What specifically has influenced this change in your music?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think it’s just like, I had never really done any recording so when I was writing songs it was just writing on a guitar and singing ‘em live. Like you just have those two textures, your playing and your singing, and the lyrics. But I guess when it came to like start recording music and making the second EP and having done the process of seeing how you start to like build a track up, it just got me thinking about more kind of compositional elements. Just thinking about ways you could kinda create effects, and maybe it’s more effective to use a different texture and a melody line from an instrument as opposed to just your voice in that plane. So I guess just that process of starting to understand recording and the actual recording process a bit more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAnd would you say working with Bullion has affected this in any way?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYeah I mean sure, like we’re good friends, we get on really well and I think we just have a really good open and creative relationship where like we share music with each other all the time, and just like being opened up to I guess different types of music I didn’t know before. But yeah, also just watching the way that he makes his music and the way he builds tracks up I think by osmosis has just kind of affected the way that I think about arranging my own stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eThere’s been a revival of 80s aesthetics across different genres in recent years. Your 2018 projects seem to somewhat reflect this trend.  What are your thoughts on this trend and how does your music fit in this landscape?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUm, I don\u0026rsquo;t know. It’s strange because when I started making this music I wasn’t aware of like that that was gonna be a thing… I never think when I’m making music like ‘I wanna reference 80s sounds,’ it’s more just playing around with different textures when it comes to recording and just trying to find stuff which frames my melodies or my voice [in a way] which seems appropriate…. If that is something that’s being revived I do think there’s a nice romanticism in a lot of those sounds and textures, maybe if that’s a thing that’s coming back… maybe it’s kind of a nostalgia thing? I guess like when Ariel Pink first came through 10 years ago it was more of a thing of using analog gear. It might be linked to people getting more like… like people rejecting too-polished and too-processed “perfect” types of music…. But I haven’t really thought about it until you asked me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eYour music seems to elude categorization. What might inform your individualism and how do you see yourself in the greater landscape of music today?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI never really liked the idea of trying to sounds like something else. When I’m making music I try to not think too much about it and just sort of see what comes out, like I try not to process it too much other than like a degree of ordering and refining. But in terms of the melodies and stuff… I just try and follow that without looking at anything too much apart from my own intuition…. I guess it’s kind of alternative music, it’s not really concerned like the current trends of mainstream pop music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eOne word that comes to mind when I think of your post-2016 output is subtlety. What is it about subtlety you find attractive?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think the more music I make and the more I sort of understand making music and putting it together… I think a lot of modern music has just too much going on. Like maximalism can be cool if there’s like a reason for it. I do try and give the different elements and textures room to breathe. Like if the ideas are strong enough they should kinda carry that weight on their own, that’s definitely a principal that I do agree with. But I guess a lot if it is also just independence and what kind of voice you have. I have the voice that I have and it has a certain texture and a certain timbre and whatever… it’s just trying to suit it [and] find the right way of framing what you do, I guess.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAs a solo artist, what would you say are some of the advantages and disadvantages of working by yourself? Does being a multi-instrumentalist influence your choice to go it alone? \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI don’t know if I’d really classify myself as a multi-instrumentalist, that’s kind of you. I kind of play guitar and play some other stuff quite badly *chuckles*. I think I’ve always just liked working on my own, for me my process is trying to expel a lot of the kinda craziness in your day to day life. It can all be quite overwhelming, a sort of wall of information. Making music has always been a quiet thing that I do just to kind of make sense of all this crazy stuff…. I was always making music before I was releasing music and it was for that kind of tranquility and solace. I guess the advantages are like, I’ve never really thought much about scenes or whatever music fits in ‘cuz I’ve never really been a part of one. So maybe in terms of sounding like an individual, that probably plays a large part in that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eYou have a degree in philosophy. Are there philosophical concepts that you try to weave into your songwriting? Has this informed any lyrical themes or references?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think there’s a lot of questions in my music. I don’t know if that’s informed necessarily by having done philosophy or [if] I did philosophy because that’s kind of the way my mind works. I am definitely quite concerned with balance. I did a lot of Greek stuff. Just thinking about like Parmenides and Aristotle… that’s something I’m definitely drawn to in music, to kind of create balance. It kinda goes back to just like, giving things room to breathe and not overloading things.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eFinally, are there any contemporary artists you recommend?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s a good question… My favorite record this year is Amen Dunes’ album. I wasn’t aware of his music until this latest album but that’s a brilliant record. What else is good… I always find that a hard question, I do listen to music a lot but when you get put on the spot your mind goes blank. I’ve actually been listening to older stuff again recently. Like I’ve kind of been going back into a Talking Heads phase, which is a thing I do semi-regularly. But the Amen Dunes record, I definitely recommend that one.\u003c/p\u003e",

DTLA is full of so much life and energy, it really never sleeps. Going up to the NOVO feels so exclusive, like a VIP experience. Three flights of escalators or stairs, to enter to a large two story arena.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I walked in, Hood Rich Pablo was performing my favorite song by him, “We Don’t Luv Em.” I had just missed my favorite high energy girl, Asian Doll. Just as I got to my area, a pushing match between two drunk girls erupted, which gave me the perfect opportunity to advance in the crowd closer to the stage. Just as I had done so, Hood Rich brought Soulja Boy to the stage. Suddenly the drama was no longer existent, and everyone was cranking that Soulja Boy (except me because I forgot how to). Between Hood Rich Pablo and Soulja Boy, I thought I walked into a jewelry store. I could barely see their performance because they looked like walking chandeliers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3024\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ae298be425b1672edae439bc6bdd33bf/tumblr_inline_pix854QXZ41qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3024\" data-orig-height=\"4032\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eSmokepurpp\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSmokepurpp did a killer performance opening for Gucci. He came out to “123” and the crowd was going wild, doing that jumpy and pushy stuff that I hate. He performed his hit songs such as “Fingers Blue” and “Geek A lot,” and he even cleared the mosh pit. This was the biggest Mosh Pit I had ever seen. Purpp did a tribute to his dear friend XXXtentacion. He mentioned that how a year ago that day, him and X did a performance together on stage at The Novo, which lead him into his tribute to X, as the crowd folded their arms, and sang to “SAD!” by the late artist. Purpp closed out his performance with my favorite song by him, “Audi.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLights go black. Multicolored lights begin to flash. Intense trap beats play in the background, then the DJ poses to the crowd the grand question, “Are you ready for Gucci Mane?” The crowd is so hype, almost in a panic. Then you hear, “Yeaaaaah, Burr” (Gucci Voice). “I got so many felonies I might can never go to Canada, but Drake said he gone pull some strings so let me check my calendar…”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2517\" data-orig-height=\"3269\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e316e2042f2f41f4bdb1a5a2960e0f74/tumblr_inline_pix86bwp1E1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2517\" data-orig-height=\"3269\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eGucci Mane x Keyshia Kaoir\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGucci Mane is the goat, period. I love his transformation, his delivery in his verses, his adoration for his wife, and most of all I loved his performance. He has so many collabs from the Migos to Drake to Big Sean. You can tell he receives energy from his fans while he’s performing, very genuine artist. There were amazing graphics of the old Gucci blaring in the background as he performed. He even brought out his wife, Keyshia Ka’oir! She is so beautiful and her energy is on ten for her husband. She hyped the crowd as he performed fan favorites such as, “I Get the Bag”, “Black Beetles”, “Both”, and “Wasted.” He has so many great songs that he was only performing about 1 minute of each. He kept fans on high energy all night. When the performance was finished, the crowd wanted more.

The most significant result of Democrats gaining control of the House will be the power to investigate the Trump administration. With a divided Congress, the question of if there is truly a way for a bipartisan government to function currently is possible, or if oversight of the Trump administration will take precedence over passing legislation. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe midterms were a night of historic firsts, especially for women. At least 100 women won house races, with 35 newly elected women gaining seats. In the Senate, 12 women won seats. Additionally, this election cycle offered the most diverse set of candidates in history. The first Muslim women were elected to Congress, the first openly gay Governor elect won in Colorado, the first Somali-American woman was elected to serve in Congress, and the first Palestinian woman was elected to Congress. All of these candidates reinforce the diversity of the Democratic party compared to the Republican party. Interestingly, this election cycle the Democrat party did not push left towards more progressive candidates as was predicted. Rather, more moderate Democrats who focused on the needs of their district won. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven a week after the midterms, citizens of Georgia and Florida are still fighting to have each vote counted. In Georgia’s governor race, Stacey Abrams has not conceded due to how close the votes were and the voter suppression that occurred. Her opponent, Brian Kemp is being accused of voter suppression while he held his position of Secretary of State in Georgia. The month before the midterms, it was reported that 53,000 voter registrations, 70% of them from Black applicants, were being held by Kemp’s office for failing to meet a match of social security and state driver records. Although Kemp has declared victory, Abrams has not conceded arguing that are still 26,000 provisional ballots that must be counted.  President Trump has called for the recounts to stop and revert to what was counted originally. Essentially, he is asking for an incomplete count of the votes to be used. In Florida, recounts are taking place for both Governor and Senate races, both of which Republicans are currently narrowly in the lead for.  In the governor race, Ron DeSantis is ahead of Democrat candidate, Andrew Gillum by merely .4%. In terms of the Senate race, Rick Scott led by only .14% over Bill Nelson. Florida counties only have until Thursday to complete all of the recounts, which many argue is too soon. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough the 2018 midterms led to many great historic firsts and the Democrats gaining control of the House; they also showed the work that still needs to be done regarding accessible voting and voting suppression. \u003c/p\u003e",

(I say major release because they did release the single “I’m Still Here” in 2014).  The EP is an amalgamation of old and new, with a few tracks that had previously been performed live for years but were never formally released. I find the EP to be a welcome addition to Mazzy Star’s discography, as it possesses the same haunting quality that I have come to expect from them. It does not steer far from their traditional sound, but it is beautiful regardless. I, for one, am just excited that they have had an excuse to begin touring again.  “Quiet the Winter Harbor” is the only single released from \u003ci\u003eStill EP\u003c/i\u003e; Hope Sandoval’s gorgeous vocals are layered over a gentle piano piece. I would happily listen to it in place of my nightly Headspace sessions. Hope Sandoval narrate my guided meditation please? “That Way Again” is arguably the most enjoyable of the four tracks, emotionally impactful but breezy. The vocals on “Still” resemble spoken word, to the effect that they become cutting, melancholic, and, frankly, creepy \u0026ndash; in the best way possible. Sandoval has formerly used this vocal style on tracks like “Umbilical” and “Mary of Silence,” both equally ghostly tracks. The last song on the EP is an alternate version of “So Tonight That I Might See,” noted as the “ascension version.” It puts an emphasis on the chaotic instrumentals, but otherwise, does not excessively differ from the original track. This EP cemented my suspicion that it’s hard to ever be disappointed by Mazzy Star; any and all new music is welcomed from my end.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e~ Anshu Patel\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

No one deserves to be ridiculed, nevertheless, physically abused or tormented because of who they love. In the same light, it would be unfortunate if Jussie did actually fake this attack, being that it would denote the severance real hate crimes. My personal stance is that the show was far too passionate and the energy was way too real in the Troubadour for this to be a faked attack.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJussie was allegedly attacked in Chicago a week prior to his performance where his attackers threw an unknown chemical substance on him and wrapped a rope around his neck. He is literally the strongest person for not canceling his already sold out Los Angeles show. Before the performance he made a powerful statement, “I’m not fully healed yet, but I’m going to. And I’m going to stand strong with yall. I had to be here tonight y’all, and it sounds bad but I couldn’t let those MF’s win. So I will always stand for love, I will never stand for anything other than that. Regardless of what anyone else says I will only stand for love, and I hope you all will stand with me. So thank you so much.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe put so much energy into his performance, and the energy that he dispelled was nothing but powerful. Jussie is an example of how music and doing what you love can truly heal any hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Troubadour a super intimate concert venue with two levels that each allow you to see the artist in a personal light. Because of this intimate setting, his family got a super close view of the performance. Even his significant other was standing on the balcony and got a special shout out from Jussie for being so attentive during his recovery and helping him realize how lucky he is to be in love.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSongs such as “You’re so beautiful,” and “Good Enough” were the highlights of the performance. Opening singing group, June’s Diary, had a beautiful harmony and array of voices in the group. They truly set a colorful tone for the performance. His dancers were so high energy and precise in their movements, that it made me want to bust a move! Finally, Jussie has the most silky smooth and genuine voice.

Jacquees is an excellent singer even when he’s tired, and he even inspired me to get in the gym and work on my Cardio because of it. He, his DJ, and background dancers are all power players, down to the Choreography.

There were about three clothing changes and the show knew how to keep your attention captive. It was truly an excellent performance where he engaged and made eye contact with everyone he could. He hosted a meet and greet after the performance and he also had plenty of merch for sale.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you Jacquees for the excellent performance!\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eInterview and transcription by Princess Amugo\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrincess: Discussing her career and her new single. But would you like to introduce yourself to the people?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNyallah: Yes hey friends my name\u0026rsquo;s Nyallah I am a vocalist, songwriter, from Los Angeles, I don\u0026rsquo;t go to yalls school. I\u0026rsquo;m actually from rival territory, but I don\u0026rsquo;t have beef with y'all. I think yall cool, so it\u0026rsquo;s all good. If you have beef that\u0026rsquo;s fine, throw hands.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eP: Post up *laughter*\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eN: right, what\u0026rsquo;s good. But yeah my name is Nyallah, I\u0026rsquo;m 20, I\u0026rsquo;m a vocalist, writer, I do like R\u0026amp;B, soul, hip-hop music, influenced music. I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on a project called \u0026lsquo;Reflections\u0026rsquo; that is scheduled to drop in December. I am super excited as Princess said earlier, I have a single called 'Growing Pains\u0026rsquo; that I wrote ages ago but is still relatable content til this day. Omg there\u0026rsquo;s a jam playing\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e*Nyallah gets super flustered because my roommate started playing her song during the interview lol,*\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut yeah I\u0026rsquo;m from LA, I study music at SC, I also curate events. I love culture, stuff pertaining to black culture, stuff pertaining to advancing Black culture and advancing knowledge and all that beautiful to black folks and accessibility and things. I think its important as artists that we do that shit and that take the time to give back to our communities that are less fortunate, not less fortunate, but in the terms of white people, yeah less fortunate to everyone else. Y'all should run us some coin lol\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eP: Right off the back, I, idk I could feel it through text. I loved her energy and I could tell through text that she was a genuine person. Just to start off, we can first talk about your single and then we can branch out. I just wanted to know what was one of your inspirations for writing this song (i.e Growing Pains)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eN: So yeah, Growing Pains I started writing in 2017. It\u0026rsquo;s the 3rd song that I wrote that I then put on the project. I wrote it during a time when I was just really sad and really depressed and just really going through it. I had just gotten out of a relationship and I had a whole 360 with my friend group. Spending time with folks that I thought I was gonna be with forever and then that changing. It was just a really tough time, there were also just things at my personal level, like it was a lot of growth and a lot of difficulty. Growing Pains was the song that I wrote kind of thinking 'oh ok so like imagining\u0026rsquo; Me imaging myself 6 months from now like being healed and fine, I was like ok 'what would I tell myself right now\u0026rsquo;. And so I kind of wrote it in that sense. And its kind of funny, because for a while Growing Pains felt sad because I\u0026rsquo;m talking about myself not falling back to the past but it\u0026rsquo;s hard for you to be like 'don\u0026rsquo;t do that`if I\u0026rsquo;m literally actively doing that. Now I am in a place where I can sing the song or I can listen to the song and its so light and its so happy and its a lot more different because the intention and the meaning behind it has shifted due to my own growth as a person and my own growth in terms of the relationship with the song. But yeah pretty much that is the premise behind it, it was me writing affirmations to myself to remind myself that everything would be good. That\u0026rsquo;s like kind of how all my music is like honestly, it all kind of sounds like affirmations or conversations with self. They kind of feel like journal entries like poetic journal entries that rhyme, that have some riffs and have some really cool background shit. But yeah that\u0026rsquo;s the premise behind 'Growing Pains\u0026rsquo;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eP: Sounds like Growing Pains acted like a time capsule of emotion that you opened up later on as you grew\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eN: Yeah, I think the emotion behind it changed, because the first time it me crying out to myself like 'don\u0026rsquo;t fall back to the past\u0026rsquo; 'don\u0026rsquo;t do this\u0026rsquo; beating myself, you can\u0026rsquo;t do that, you can\u0026rsquo;t do this you know like a little kid, slapping them on the wrist and then as time passed and as I started writing more of the project growing into myself and just really embracing everything about my identity, about me as a person, not surface level but me as Nyallah and then me as Nyallah black, queer femme. And then me as black queer femme who is a vocalist and an artist and a content creator and all these different things and yeah. I was in a place where I was at the beginning of that journey and now I am a little bit further along that journey, I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m done, I don\u0026rsquo;t think the journey is ever done but I am very much further along in that journey. I have a very different perspective on things now and I needed to go through that really dark time of feeling straight up alone even though I wasn\u0026rsquo;t really alone. There were people in my life that still cared about me, I had to go through that process of 'dang nobody gives a fuck about me\u0026rsquo; and feeling like 'so many people who were close to me you just turned on me\u0026rsquo; people who I known for years\u0026hellip;there are certain situations that you think its not going to go that way but it does and that\u0026rsquo;s life. With this project, Reflections, the whole reason that it is called reflections is because it’s like me looking at the mirror and being like this is all the shit that I have learned and experienced within the last year, this is where I am at. It\u0026rsquo;s like me being like, hey guys hows it going my name is Nyallah. Here is where I have been for the last 2 years and I know you\u0026rsquo;ve all been curious, I\u0026rsquo;m a Capricorn I don\u0026rsquo;t say shit so yall don\u0026rsquo;t know what really is going on. But here enjoy. That is what the intention of it is was. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t the writing the project to write a project, like I was just writing to write and then eventually I was like 'oh I have enough stuff where I could make a project like I could tell a story, I could really go into some stuff and unpack my shit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eP: Speak your truth and things.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eN: Exactly because that\u0026rsquo;s really what music is for me. Its healing and unpacking and releasing. If I\u0026rsquo;m able to do that for myself and then do that for other people through my music like me get that therapy and then also be able to inspire others and get people through tough times like that is a blessing cause it\u0026rsquo;s not all about me or any of us, its just all about the collective. And I think that the more we recognize that and the more that we actively work with that in mind things are a lot easier. I learned that, and I\u0026rsquo;m learning that now because of all that I have experienced you know. Like I said I had to go through times of feeling like dang I\u0026rsquo;m really alone, I don\u0026rsquo;t think this will ever get better like oh I\u0026rsquo;m black and queer and femme and the whole world is essentially out to get me like I am not the norm. I am the polar opposite of what is the norm which is upper-middle class, cis-hetero white male total opposite. This world, in America, but the world at large the world at large is built to not support me, to not allow me to exist but me learning to be like with that all in mind still choosing love, still choosing to focus what I can do for my people, in the moment\u0026hellip;.I had to experience all of that in order to understand that\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eP: Wow I loved your answer. I guess you already answered this question in a way but I was going to ask now that you have this mindset, how do you now navigate through the world as an artist as a black queer femme.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eN: Just unapologetically as fuck. I\u0026rsquo;ve gone through the process of 'omg I\u0026rsquo;m going to silence myself, omg I\u0026rsquo;m going to do this, oh I need to make it so I\u0026rsquo;m palatable, omg I\u0026rsquo;m super femme but I\u0026rsquo;m not here for the male gaze but I think I need to do this for the male gaze so that I can get\u0026mdash;I don\u0026rsquo;t give a fuck. Like I don\u0026rsquo;t care anymore because the fact of the matter is, this whole thing is not made for me so I\u0026rsquo;m not supposed to succeed in it anyway even if I do do all that stuff so I\u0026rsquo;m just gonna do what I need to do, what feels comfortable, what feels safe, what feels rational for me. In order for me to get through and like that\u0026rsquo;s not playing into these norms or these stereotypes and these expectations `and all this fuckshit that has been put on us by white supremacist society. I think that it\u0026rsquo;s really interesting because people ask me this all the time \u0026ldquo;how do you navigate spaces\u0026rdquo; and I\u0026rsquo;m just like I come in with my bright colored hair I\u0026rsquo;m dressed however I\u0026rsquo;m dressed and I do what I have to do. I mean, I always feel that because I\u0026rsquo;m black and because I\u0026rsquo;m a woman I just deal with hella sexism and hella racism and then the intersectionality of that. Dealing with white men not acknowledging your existence and like your voice being silenced by white men, by black men, by white women, by this by that until they need something from you. I have always dealt with high expectations. I have really high expectations, that\u0026rsquo;s why I have anxiety. A lot of my anxiety is because of shit I\u0026rsquo;ve normalized that\u0026rsquo;s really just something that society has taught me like\u0026hellip;.being in these spaces where you\u0026rsquo;re doing that work you are doing above and beyond but yet you\u0026rsquo;re seeing your white counterparts doing a quarter of the work and getting triple the praise for shitty work\u0026hellip;I think knowing that we did all of this, I\u0026rsquo;m not an egomaniac. I think its really easy as black people to get trapped up in the cycle of white supremacy and of capitalism and all that shit. Where we think that we need to have all these cars and all that stuff on the class level but also in the terms of 'I need to look a certain way, I need to detach from my blackness\u0026rsquo; I\u0026rsquo;m not going to use any examples 'I\u0026rsquo;m going to detach from what feels comfortable to me\u0026rsquo; because blackness is so fluid. It\u0026rsquo;s the gang bangers, its the crips and bloods doing ay and z but its also the Afrocentric folxs doing drum circles its all these different things. Its the black folks going to school and trying to be doctors and lawyers, it\u0026rsquo;s the black folxs that are change makers in public policy, it\u0026rsquo;s the black people doing curation and creative work. WE are so fluid and I think as much as they have tried to shove my blackness in my face, it\u0026rsquo;s just helped me loved my blackness more. It makes me realize, I have something that y'all don\u0026rsquo;t have and it makes you mad and I don\u0026rsquo;t know why you\u0026rsquo;re perfect just the way you are, you don\u0026rsquo;t need any of this just like I don\u0026rsquo;t need any of your shit, but that\u0026rsquo;s your battle that you have to fight um and if you keep trying to project on me you can but I\u0026rsquo;m going to keep being unfazed and just doing what I need to do and focusing on myself..What I have learned going to a PWI in the music program, especially being black and queer you experience people wanting to pimp you out but they also want you to sit down and take their shit and to be shat on over and over again\u0026hellip;Its interesting to see the dichotomies\u0026hellip;its crazy because you\u0026rsquo;re in the middle of this intersection and you have people constantly telling you that you need to ignore this part of you, this is what you are and its so fucking annoying and I\u0026rsquo;ve just learned how to just silence most of [the bullshit] but I think I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten good at being like that\u0026rsquo;s how yall feel but this is where I\u0026rsquo;m at, this is what I\u0026rsquo;m feeling, this is like what I stand for and that\u0026rsquo;s like made it a lot easier. Remembering this is all us, like we did this, that always makes me feel really good\u0026hellip;Being in the music program I\u0026rsquo;ve dealt with [violence, manipulation, the most malicious shit], but I can\u0026rsquo;t sit and be malicious too because its a dumbass cycle and that is what you want, you want me to vibrate lower, be bitter, to step out of my zone and step out of focusing on myself and focusing on putting the people forward to focusing on your petty shit, I don\u0026rsquo;t give a fuck. I\u0026rsquo;ve learned so much about detachment within my program, I navigate spaces and relationships differently\u0026hellip;.learning how to do the work even when that person doesn\u0026rsquo;t fuck with you and makes it point to make it difficult. I\u0026rsquo;ve matured so much. Its eye opening because as a black, queer woman you see damn yall all made childish, you have to mature so quickly\u0026hellip;.I\u0026rsquo;ve learned to love myself more and grown into myself more\u0026hellip;cause I\u0026rsquo;ve tried conforming and not conforming and I\u0026rsquo;m like you don\u0026rsquo;t like that still because there will always be something wrong with me [in their eyes] because at the end of the day I still look the way I look, I still have the history I have and at the end of the day you don\u0026rsquo;t like what you see because of your own personal things\u0026hellip;that\u0026rsquo;s why I don\u0026rsquo;t care about white people\u0026hellip;because I have encyclopedia of receipts of yall. My identity, in relation to my program, has taught me how to focus on myself at the end of the day I just have to focus on myself\u0026hellip;.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eP:\u0026hellip;You just hit the mark on everything\u0026hellip;I wanted to ask what other mediums do you do?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eN: Music is my main thing that I have done the longest to go back to prior to college, I did musical theatre all of high school. I started doing theatre in 8th grade and then I just started doing musical theatre and stuff. I did my first straight play Senior year, I did Joe Turner\u0026rsquo;s 'Come and Gone\u0026rsquo; by August Wilson. Black, black, plays. It\u0026rsquo;s really good, it talks about the slave trade, it actually talks about intergenerational stuff. Like that\u0026rsquo;s literally my whole thing. I feel like the universe brought me here in part do intergenerational work and shit. So I\u0026rsquo;ve always done music and I joined a choir in the fourth grade and I started learning how to play piano around the same time. In elementary school, I played violin for a little bit, clarinet for a little bit. Violin for like 2 years, Clarinet for like a year.  Then in middle school, I did choir still, I was given awards in talent shows and shit. Then I did a play in the 8th grade and then I could write. That\u0026rsquo;s when I realized I could write like I could write plays because I always wrote poetry in like stories and tried to write a song but I just didn\u0026rsquo;t. For some reason it was really hard, I was a good detailed writer but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t put it with the music, it was always really hard, it would always be too many words, not enough melody or something. It was always something. I honestly just needed to refine it. It was always in the back of my head. Then I went to high school, I went to Hollywood High for 2 years and did show choir there and choir and plays and stuff, musicals. Then I started my first musical In the Heights my sophomore year and Abuela Claudia that shit was hard, she be sanging lol. I did a musical twice, I did it my sophomore year, junior year, when I switched schools we did it again. So I\u0026rsquo;ve just always done chamber choir, show choir, musical theatre, plays, I did photography. Like I was always writing. Writing and music is what I\u0026rsquo;ve done the longest and photography. Photography I started in 9th grade, summer of 9th grade. I was doing that and then stop. I always would stop and go with cause I feel like with photography, I loved the visual, I think it\u0026rsquo;s important, I love the snapshot of just a moment and being able to curate that moment exactly how you wanted it to be or capturing what is. I\u0026rsquo;m always dating visual artists because I just love how their minds work. I love how they can see the world and they see it completely different from how everyone views it but they can still merge their shit into another thing that\u0026rsquo;s dope. But yeah I was doing all those different things and then I did Grammy Camp the summer before my senior year of high school and that\u0026rsquo;s when I was like 'oh dang I can study music\u0026rsquo; because for the longest time, I was like 'I\u0026rsquo;m just gonna be a writer, I\u0026rsquo;m going to study English, I\u0026rsquo;m going to study film and its fine and it\u0026rsquo;s fine because people kept telling me that you can\u0026rsquo;t do music, everyone wants to do music. But then when I went to Grammy Camp at USC I was like 'oh there is a contemporary music program that is not just Jazz or Classical\u0026rsquo; because I knew that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to get into any of those programs because I wasn\u0026rsquo;t classically trained and I wasn\u0026rsquo;t jazz trained, I hadn\u0026rsquo;t been doing that for years. So I just knew that and I was like 'damn how the fuck was this gon work\u0026rsquo; and yeah I applied to USC I also had really good grades. They always knew that I would get into any school I applied to, they were just like 'you need to figure out what you want to do\u0026rsquo; you\u0026rsquo;re smart, but you don\u0026rsquo;t need to read for the rest of your life. That\u0026rsquo;s already going to be something to do. I applied to USC got in the first time, didn\u0026rsquo;t get into the Music Program but I got in for English and then after that, I got into the School to transfer. So I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing the program for three years and not four which means I have to take more classes at once and it\u0026rsquo;s jam-packed. Its kind of hard, but I\u0026rsquo;m almost done yknow I have one more semester after this, I\u0026rsquo;m thankful I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten through this one. I\u0026rsquo;m literally like damn I\u0026rsquo;m almost finished\u0026hellip;.I was always just doing different things. But now I do music mostly I write as well. So I sing and I write but I also take photos still. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to add more photos onto my feed but I keep having a conflict of interest with it because its like oh I\u0026rsquo;m an artist, I\u0026rsquo;m a musician so all my stuff on my feed should be my music but then its like naw if I wanna post all that\u0026mdash;its just kind of hard, I keep going back and forth with stuff. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna just starting being more fluid with it. I do photography, I write poetry but I put that on the same line as the music, but I write. Poetry helps me how I write out lyrically\u0026hellip;I do content curation. I started this series called the loft sessions my sophomore year of college, I\u0026rsquo;m a senior now. We\u0026rsquo;ve been on a hiatus because I needed to finish my EP Reflections. But now that\u0026rsquo;s almost done, I want to regroup and figure something out. I want to do some stuff and what else. I love doing events. Loft Sessions was kind of cool because it was a quarterly event series centered around black artists, for black artists, by black artists. I started it because I was tired of going to all these events that were school funded and there were no black artists, we weren\u0026rsquo;t at the center. Or feeling like damn ok if my music isn\u0026rsquo;t this, this or this, it\u0026rsquo;s not gonna work, it’s not gonna sell. So I started Loft Session, it was actually in collab with some UCLA folxs so a lot of my friends at UCLA and USC came together and they helped me put everything together. I would curate everything like the lineup and do it in my loft, in the loft I lived in. We would sell drinks and whatnot and showcase so many different types of artists. We\u0026rsquo;ll have black visual artists, photographers, I wanted to do filmmakers at one point. I wanted to live painting and different stuff like that, they would showcase like that and then we would have live DJs, bands, rappers, singers etc come in and perform. I was really cool because it was just a space where everybody black was able to behold space, have fun\u0026hellip;supporting black artists and meeting new people. Just having a good ass fucking time. But I want to focus more marginalized voices in the black community because we had a lot of men and I had different rules that were disrespected\u0026hellip;now that I have more time I understand how to navigate that differently. We didn\u0026rsquo;t turn away anyone who wasn\u0026rsquo;t black\u0026hellip;it was nice that we were at the center. I want to plan some things over winter break and over the next year. I want to plan shows, collaborative things, identity focused-caused focused events because those are important\u0026hellip;I want everyone to get that representation because it\u0026rsquo;s long overdue. Other than singing, writing songs poetry stories, event curation and photography. I want to do more creative direction. Like with my project I want to more directing but I\u0026rsquo;m scared. I want to find a filmmaker that I can vibe and we can collaborate and \u0026hellip;.I want to be as active in my process as possible I\u0026rsquo;m not tryna be idle. I like to cook. Spirituality, holistic healing. I\u0026rsquo;m a crystal wearer\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eP: You\u0026rsquo;ve already answered this, but I was going to ask, what should we be looking for in terms of like what you\u0026rsquo;re going to be putting out in terms of projects. You\u0026rsquo;ve already answered this with curating, creative curation, all of that and of course your EP coming out \u0026ldquo;Reflections\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eN: I can reiterate\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eP: Yeah for sure\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eN: Well Growing Pains is out right now, that is on all streaming platforms, Spotify, Apple Music Tidal, Youtube, SoundCloud, Amazon Prime, etc Listen to it add it to your playlist, share it with your mommy your aunty your grandma everybody.

    "title": "Excerpted Interview With Westside McFly (11/16/18)",
    "content": "\u003ch2\u003eInterview occurred on the “No Pulp Radio Show” with DJ Odyssey, Ishaan Pota and Lily Frankel \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis interview has been transcribed edited for concision with some questions edited for clarity by Lily Frankel\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJO: So for those who aren’t familiar with you, who are you, where are you from? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWM: Yeah, well, I grew up in South Central, man. I’m from Los Angeles, you know what I’m saying. Right there on the east side. Everybody kinda get confused by the name and stuff like that, but you know it’s Westside McFly I’m from the West Coast, but I grew up on the east side, Los Angeles. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJO: And what was that experience like, growing up in Los Angeles? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWM: Man, it was crazy, you know what I’m saying. You know, obviously, the album is out, and the title of it is, “South Central Ain’t 4 Everybody.” I feel like, that experience, growing up in South Central, is really difficult, and I wanted to\u0026hellip; kinda let the world know what’s it’s like, and how, you know, it’s kinda hard to make it, where we from. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJO: And seeing what you’re saying, it’s so hard to make it, coming out of South Central, what do you think is the most notorious challenge of trying to get out? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWM: Well I mean, obviously, you know, when you think about South Central, you think about LA, everybody already think about the gangs, the violence, the drugs, the police. You know what I’m saying, when you think about like, NWA, and all, like, fuck the police, you know what I’m saying, like. So growing up, where I grew up, you see that a lot, you know what I’m saying. It was drug dealers, it was gang bangers, it was—I mean, we, you know, we don’ faced it all. We don’ dealt with the police, we done all of the that, you know what I’m saying. So\u0026hellip; um, you kinda come from a different cloth when you gotta go through that as a young kid and you see so early, and there’s no way for your parents to kinda like shield you from what’s going on outside, in the world, you know what I’m saying. My granny lived on 81st and Central, the school I went to was off of McKinley and 83rd, that’s like two blocks up! So just walkin from my granny’s house to school, you could either run into somebody that’s gon ask you where you from, you might see a cop roll by, and they, you know, the cops—like, people always kinda confuse that, like, “oh, they gettin harassed by the cop, they gettin beat on by the cops,” it’s not that, like you could just get flashed by some police, and we take that as harassment, you know what I’m saying, cause I’m just mindin’ my business, just walkin up the street, what you got to flash me with your light for? You know what I’m saying. So it’s a lot of things that\u0026hellip; I would say, made me who I am today, and\u0026hellip; bring the music out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJO: Was music always the first option, or did you wanna be something else?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWM: Nah, nah, I would say that was like my first option. I come from a family\u0026hellip; you know, basketball players. Actually my cousin is actually Baron Davis. So I come from a basketball family, it was all sports. For me, I was that kid that was like\u0026hellip; I had my little composition book and I was writing poems. You know what I’m saying? Like my pops, he lived in Compton, so he lived right off Piru street\u0026hellip; I was at his house one day and I was writing like, little poems in my little composition book. And then like the neighbrohood bum, you know, he came through or whatever—think he was asking my dad if he could wash the car or somethin’, and he was askin’ me what I was doin’. And I was like, “what?” And he was like, “man, what you doin?” And tell him, I’m like, “man, I’m writing some poetry, you know what I’m sayin, just workin on my stuff.” He was like, “ahh, let me hear some stuff,” so I spit it and he was like, “man, you sound like you rappin!” And that was kinda like my first, like, “damn, like, it kinda do sound like I’m rappin.” And then I kinda took to it more cause my grandfather was a DJ, my grandmother, she collected like, old school 45 records, and stuff like that, so music kinda just always been there for me, you know what I’m sayin?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJO: So mentioning how you got a DJ in your family, mentioning that, you know, your grandma had the 45s, like, what were some of the musical influences that you grew up listening to, like what was Grandma spinning, what was the family spinnin? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWM: Damn. Alright so, back then? I mean you thinkin’ about like the The Temptations, you think about Diane Ross, Minnie Riperton. That’s what she was into. Al Green, Marvin Gaye—Michael Jackson was her ultimate favorite [laughing]. She had every Michael Jackson record you could think of. All the way back from Jackson 5, little Michael, to like, Billy Jean, Bad Michael. Like, she was a huge fan of Mike. My grandfather, being a DJ I guess, his vibe was different, because the club setting is different, people here drinking and smoking, and all of that goin on or whatever, back in that time. So it was a little different, his records had a little bit more upbeat, but, I felt like, every time music came on, it gave you a different experience about life. And a different setting. And it put you in a different place. And for me, I just kinda always wanted to be a part of that world. To be a creator of that, you know what I’m saying? And kinda capture and cement the memories and moments of\u0026ndash;of what we don’ went through. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJO: Does it piss you off when you hear a younger rapper, or people who pretend to be from “the hood,” to use that—when they haven’t actually seen it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWM: Yeah, I definitely, it makes me mad, when that happens. Because, you know, that’s not anything to be glamorized, in my opinion. When you really from a place that’s like, it’s trife, you know what I’m saying? And it’s really like, yo, you could really lose you life, livin out here. It’s\u0026hellip; it’s kinda difficult when that happens, cause you got people that are kinda like, fakin’ it. And for me, I take it as disrespect, because it’s kinda like a badge of honor to be able to say, “look, I lived in this city, I grew up in this neighborhood, I seen my friend get shot right here, I don seen this happen right here, I don—duh duh duh duh duh.” And for somebody to come along and just kinda fake that, and want to be part of that cause it look cool—it’s like, nah, I’m not wit that, you not gon come make money off of our struggle, you know what I’m saying? I ain’t having that. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJO: Especially when you livin’ it day in, day out. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWM: Day in’ day out! And I still got friends that’s livin in the hood, you know, I still got aunties, I still got cousins, so—it’s not always pretty, but it ain’t always ugly, like don’t get it twisted, the hood ain’t just like a “scary” place. Like if you get a chance? Fo sure, go take a trip down to Watts, go take a trip down to South Central, go see what it’s like. Go breathe in the air. You know what I’m saying? Go see what the people is like, so then you could really understand it. And I feel like people that are infatuated with like, Compton and Watts and South Central, they should go do that. If they really like—you know, if you really wanna know about it, go see about it. That’s what you gon do when you—if it’s a pair of Gucci shoes out that you want, you gon go to the Beverly Center, you gon cop them Gucci shoes, you gon go see how they look, you gon put em on your feet, you gon walk in them. So go do the same thing with the neighborhood, you know what I’m saying? Lily: Do you feel like people have certain misconceptions about South Central, or that area in general? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWM: Definitely. Because of—I think it started when the riots happened. When the riots happened—there’s certain things about, you know, East LA, that we can’t control. And what the media puts out about East LA, we can’t control it. You know what I’m saying? We don’t have those platforms. And\u0026hellip; the last big artist to make it from the east side.. [long pause] I don’t—dang. In my opinion, you’d probably have to say like, NWA, Snoop came from the East side of Long Beach, you know what I’m saying? Like, who can speak on that major platform, Snoop made it to that major platform, where he can kinda give you a different outlook of how the hood is, you know what I’m saying? Is it dangerous? Yes. Is it a whole bunch of, like, just crackheads and crack babies? No. Like, you know what I’m saying? Like, yeah, you gon see a few. But, we didn’t have no money to bring crack there, you know what I’m saying? How did it get there? So you go back to Reaganomics, and you go back—like, everything started back then. And I feel like the perception that the media painted for the city, you know what I’m saying? We cleanin’ it up. The youngers that’s coming out, you got a lot of people that’s coming out\u0026hellip; from Watts, from Compton. When you think about Kendrick Lamar—Kendrick Lamar, you know, his grammy performances and everything like that, that’s changing the perception of people, you know what I’m saying? Like of what they think about Compton. Back then it was “fuck the police,” and now you watchin Kendrick, you know, at the Grammys, on stage, and you lookin’ at Compton a whole different way. You know what I’m saying? So\u0026hellip; I feel like the perception is definitely changin. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJO: So let’s talk about your album, you know, “South Central Ain’t 4 Everybody.” With that title in itself, it’s just like, it seems like you’re just tryna like, “yo, let me set the record straight.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWM: Yeah, definitely. Quick story. I was in the studio, man. And I wanna say at the time, the album was maybe like, 75% done, and I was playing records for people, just tryna get reactions and stuff like that, and I had this one particular A\u0026amp;R that was there, I’m not gon name drop. [Laughs.] Yeah, that’s for snitches, I ain’t gon name drop. But, he actually heard the music, man, and he was like, yo, I really think you should do like this type of sound, you know, you should do what’s in right now, what’s hot. You should do that other record that you did. And because I write for people, I have a different—a wide-range, I should say, of records in my catalogue. So at the time, he had probably heard like some trap record that I had wrote for like TV or film, or whatever. And I remember just telling him like, Bro, that ain’t me. That’s not the picture that I’m tryna paint, that’s not South Central, that’s not what I’m about, you know what I mean. And I remember leaving the studio, it was me, my engineer, and my little cousin. My little cousin’s maybe like 15, he go to Crenshaw High. And literally we was having a conversation about it, and I’m like damn, I really can’t understand why people don\u0026rsquo;t understand\u0026hellip; you know, where we come from, and why that’s, like, not mainstream enough for them. And I remember my little cousin saying to me “yo, South Central ain’t for erybody, cuzzo.” And, at that time, I was just like, yo [laughs], that’s what I’m naming the album. [\u0026hellip;] It was just like, yo. Simple and plain, bro, like, South Central ain’t for everybody. There are certain people that can make it here and certain people that can’t. And this album will give you a piece of that, like, so you can understand it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJO: You said there are some people who can make it and some people who can’t. What are the characteristics of somebody who can make it? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWM: You gotta be tough. Erybody ain’t gotta be a gangster to make it in South Central but you gotta be tough for sure. You know, you gotta be real. You gotta stay loyal, you gotta ride for your people. You gotta\u0026hellip; I mean, you just gotta have like, the ambition and hustle of\u0026hellip; a real hustler, like for real. Because ain’t nobody like, gonna give you anything, where we from. We weren’t given anything. You know, to begin with. Like I said, like, watchin’ my momma struggle, she had four kids. She had no handouts. She had no help. You know what I’m saying? She had to work hard. And\u0026hellip; watchin the strength of her, put it in me. Like alright, I gotta get up and go get it, especially if pops ain’t around, and—you know what I’m saying? So you kinda go through a lot of different phases as a young man, growing up in South Central, right, where you gotta now—I gotta help my moms, and my sisters, I want them—you know what I’m saying? And especially if you wanna be on some fly shit yo self, and you wanna look fresh and you don’t wanna go to school looking like\u0026hellip; you know what I’m saying? You got—kids is mean! [DJO laughs.] Let’s think about it, come on man, the 90s, what? You was gettin clowned if you was comin to school with some busted shoes. But if you had some fresh whites on, you was the man. And you had a nice outfit, you was—you know what I’m saying? Fresh cut, all of that, so—moms couldn’t always afford everything! So sometimes you gotta go get up and go hustle up some stuff with homies and—ay, mom, I just bought my own shoes, like you feel me? She don’t gotta know where it came from. There’s a lot of things we don did that, of course your parents ain’t gon be proud of, you know what I’m saying. But at the same time, you do what you gotta do to survive. Yeah, so I think that survival instinct, it comes. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJO: Take me over when you were composing these two songs [“Bitch Please” and “Piece of My Love”], what was going through your mind? Because in listening to “Bitch Please,” and then “Piece of My Love,” they’re on both ends of the spectrum. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWM: One of them’s far left, the other’s far right. Yeah, definitely. So a lot of people was\u0026hellip; disturbed when they first heard “Bitch please,” cause they like, “ahh, you talkin bout women.” I’m like, nah—okay, so to break that down—and I feel like men know what’s up when it comes to this—you got women out there, sometime, that like—not all women are bitches, like you know what I’m sayin, but you have some that you come across where you’re like “man, bitch please,” like you’re feeling yourself a little too much, and there is certain women that are just so into themselves where it’s like yo, you gotta kinda like bring em back down to earth, but besides that, you got women out there that are like just gold-diggers, clout-chasers, like you know what I’m saying? They just want to be around, and be in the scene, or they might wanna talk to you, or get with the homie, and those are the women that I’m talkin to on “Bitch Please,” the trifling ones. There’s a separation between real women that’s out there, doin they job, and really gettin to a bag, and hustlin, and providing for themselves, they not lookin for no man for nothin, so it’s a separation, and that’s what “Piece of My love Is,” for that women that really deserve that, because not every woman, you know what I’m saying, really deserve that from you. There’s certain women out there that you gonna throw ones at, it’s certain women out there that you gonna go buy, you know, a gucci bag, or a ring, you feel me? It’s different types of women in the world, so. That’s just me bein real. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: So you’ve written songs for other people, and you write your own music. What is the difference for you in that process, between when you’re writing a song for somebody else, verses when you’re focusing on your own music, do you feel like there’s a difference? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWM: Yeah definitely, cause\u0026hellip; when I’m writing for other people, I have to really put myself in that place, where they are in their life. And, I can’t always just be like yo, who is this person, what have they gone through, and write about that. It’s gotta be like, what could they possibly be going through right now, what’s next for them, you know what I’m saying? Sometimes you can go off past experiences but you just gotta put yourself in their shoes, for a second. And I feel like as a creator and somebody that’s a fan of music, that’s pretty easy to do. And I feel like most artists—if you’re a true artist, you can do that. You know what I’m saying? I’m not afraid to say I’m a fan of certain artists, you feel me? So to be able to step outside of who I am as a person, and as a creator, as an artist, and be like, well, let me put myself in this person’s shoes real quick and write a record, what would it sound like. You know what I’m saying, to me \u003cbr/\u003ethat’s fun\u0026hellip; and it’s challenging at the same time. But it’s something that I’ve grown to learn—the whole like songwriting process, being a songwriter, it’s just something that I’ve learned, for sure, and I’m still learning! You know what I’m saying? I don’t even feel like—if you think about Quincy Jones, you think about a lot of like great musicians in the industry, right, they kept learning, they whole career, they just kept learning, kept learning, kept learning, so every day is a part of the process. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIshaan: So when you go to the studio, what’s your process? Do you go in with ideas? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWM: Yeah, my process is kinda weird, I always feel like in order for me to create records, I have to live, right? So like, “South Central Ain’t 4 Everybody” was like a two year\u0026hellip; two and a half year project. I put a lot of time into that project, you know what I’m saying? Like, you have a lot of different artists now that will just sit in they room for like ten days and be like “yo I got a mixtape and it’s the hottest shit out.” That’s not gonna be the case, cause you ain’t experience shit in that ten days, bro. You sat in that room by yourself, like, either smokin, or drinking, or eatin hot cheetos, whatever the fuck you was doin [studio laughs], and you just felt like—you imagined life instead of really experiencing it, like you know what I’m saying? So for me like, I felt like I have to go through shit in order to be able to go into the studio and talk about shit, so you gotta be livin like, every day, like you know what I’m saying? I gotta be able to talk about what I see my moms go through, sometimes you gotta get back to that. You know what I’m saying? And sometimes it be reality, like yo I just hung up with mom, she sick, yada yada yada, and now, you know what I’m saying, this is where I’m at mentality, it’s taking me back to when I was a kid, and now I’m writing this type of record. You know, or, it’s just one of them nights, where it’s like, yo, this chick, she trippin, she—she just worried about what Ima buy her and where Ima take her, and duh duh duh duh duh, and then you get records like “Bitch Please” and then like—you know what I’m saying? It’s all different types of moods and vibes, like lit, like I’m know, notoriously known, the come-up boys, we known, for like throwin parties like, house parties. [\u0026hellip;] We also do a charity thing with the come-up boys, our movement, so this year we’re gon do a blanket give-back. Over the summer we did a food, hygiene, uh, care packs, and water, and soda. Um\u0026hellip; so this December I think we’ll do food again, um, but instead of the hygiene pack—over the Summer we did like toothbrush, toothpaste, lotion, wipes, socks—this time we’re gonna do blankets and jackets. That’s the plan for the Winter. [\u0026hellip;] It’s so crazy, the—it’s an ongoing problem, obviously, we have a lot of homeless out here, in Los Angeles. And I remember growing up, I went to high school, Hamilton, bro. And I remember one day I was driving up—I want to say I was driving up either Broadway or Main—and I seen somebody I went to school with, and bro was doing bad, man. Like bad bad. And I’m like, “yo, this is somebody I actually went to high school with.” So you kinda see yourself in that, cause it’s like, yo, this can easily be you, and we don’t know what happened in his life, you know what I’m saying, but obviously he need help, and, you know, I pulled over, I helped. There’s been times, you can ask my people, there’s been times I done gave shoes away, you know what I’m saying, if I got shoes in my cars, then forget it, if I got shoes in my trunk, forget it, you can have it. Shirts, money, all that, bro. Cause we gon get it back tenfolds over, you know what I’m saying. But you don’t know what that can do, just to help somebody else. [\u0026hellip;] And that’s really important with our squad, because we know where we come from, so we know how hard it is to get it, we know how hard it is to lose it, and we always want to give back to those who don’t. L: So, it seems like with your music, the overall goal or theme is trying to convey what you were talking about earlier, like this is where you’re from and trying to portray it in an accurate way, would you say that’s your goal with making music? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWM: Yeah. And just speaking for the streets and the people that had to come from the streets, you know what I’m saying? And from, with a different perspective, cause like obviously, when you think about the \u003cbr/\u003egangs and stuff like that, everybody—you ain’t gotta grow up and be from somewhere, or be a gang-banger, to speak for the streets, you know what I’m saying? You ain’t gotta sell drugs to speak for the streets. Now mind you, there’s—like I said, again, there’s things in my life, that, you know, you don did, that your moms and pops may not be proud of, but you do what you had to do to survive, right, but at the same time, I just wanna be that beacon for the next kid, to be like, “yo, you can do it like me, and you can make it.” You know what I’m saying? You ain’t gotta succumb to what your homies want you to be, you ain’t gotta succumb to what the world think you should be, or think—who you are, you know, like sometimes the world may already have they mind made up about who you are. You could change that person’s perception, like you could change the perception of the world, you know what I’m saying, so I just wanna be that beacon that provides that message, through my music. [\u0026hellip;] I mean like, just with the company itself, we do everything, like we got a catering service, you know what I’m saying? We have a, obviously, it was clothing line, originally. It was the record label and our clothing line, originally. And I wanna say after the first two years we expanded, we had a catering service. After that we started doing our charity give-back. And there’s gonna be more expansions, like we want to get into tech stuff, you know what I’m saying? That’s stuff that we into. Just cause we grew up in the hood don’t mean that we’re not entrepreneurs, we’re not smart, you know what I’m saying, like we don’t have, you know, any kind of vision behind our brand, you know what I’m saying? But we have these people like myself, like Q, my boy Jamil, my boy Trill, my boy Jax, we’re all like, you know, the main people pushing this brand. And even those up under us, you know—it’s so many come-up boys, it’s like 20 of us, to be honest with you. We gotta whole gang, for real, it looks like a gang. We move like a gang, look like a gang, but we ain’t a gang, you know what I’m saying? [studio and DJO laughing] It’s crazy. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJO: I feel like it’s really important that your neighborhood see somebody like you that made it out, see somebody succeeding, see somebody who’s contributing and giving back. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWM: Talk that talk. I wasn’t destined to be here, bro. When I was born, I was born with sickle cell, right? So the doctors told my mom I’m supposed to die at the age of 10. So I’m already up against that, right? But then you grew up in the hood, you grew up poor, then you had to deal with the gangs, then you had to deal with the drugs, then you had to deal with the cops, then—you know what I’m saying? So you already up against everything, not to mention being black in America—it’s difficult. [Agreement from the studio.] You know what I’m saying? Like let’s just be honest. So when you look at that, and you be like, yo, this kid made it from here, and this is the success he attained over this amount of time, by putting in this work, staying true to who he was, staying true to his people and his friends that was around him, listening, learning, taking in everything, and then creatively puttin it out to the world to be like yo, this is what I’m about, you feel me? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJO: Do you ever feel like, you know, because you’ve overcome so much adversity and so many obstacles in your life, like, you ever walk around with a chip on your shoulder? Or you always keep it humble. \u003cbr/\u003eWM: It’s kind of like, you know how like, one side is the angel, one side is the devil? [Laughter in the studio.] I have the chip over here [gestures to left shoulder], but then I’m humble as fuck over here [gestures to other shoulder]. And sometimes it’s difficult cause you don’t know which one to listen to. You know what I’m saying, like is it stay humble, or is it walk around with that chip? But I feel like, when you grow in the hood, you already kinda got a chip on your shoulder, to prove that you’re more than what they’ve told people the people that come from the hood is about. You know what I’m saying? Like I said, going back to that perception that’s put out there by the media, you know what I’m saying? The way they talk about the hood is not always\u0026hellip; proper. And so that perception, that people think about us, we already kinda have that chip on our shoulder, where we gotta prove people wrong,, you feel me? I think that’s always gonna be a part of who I am as a person and as an artist. You gon hear it in my music, you gon see it when I’m walking, you gon see it when I’m having a conversation with whoever, and then also being humble about where I come from, and about what I had to go through, and the successes that I attained. I’m still gon be humble about it cause I understand like yo, it could be here today, it could be gon tomorrow. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJO: And what would you say—you know, respecting the process—what was the hardest part in your process? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWM: I think gettin out of my own way sometimes. Cause I’m a perfectionist. And I think the hardest part about my own process—like me and the homies, we don got into many arguments, about when to pick the music out, and what songs to put out, what videos to shoot, I don got in a lot of arguments with these dudes. But they brothers for life, you feel me? But sometimes I be in my own way, and I be like, overthinking. But that goes back to having that chip on my shoulder, I wanna prove people wrong. So I just got this burning ambition to be like yo, I gotta do it right, it gotta look good, it gotta duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, we can’t take no Ls, you know what I’m saying? Even though like, all Ls are lessons, but [laughs] like nah, for real, Ls is lessons, but you know for me, it’s like nah, we ain’t got time for that. We puttin points on the board. We gotta move correctly, you know what I’m saying? We gotta move proper, strategically, so I’m real big on that, and I’m the type of person, people can’t tell me no. You know what I’m saying? “Ah nah, we can’t do that! That’s impossible!” I can’t be around a motherfucker that’s like that. You know what I’m saying? Like, you\u0026hellip; I’m not gon let anybody tell me that something can’t be done. Cause we gon figure it out, you know what I’m saying? And that’s just what it is. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJO: So what would you say is one of those biggest dreams? Do you ever see yourself falling back from rap and being like, “I’m gonna make a label now”? \u003cbr/\u003eI mean, we gon do way more than just a record label, like we already own our own record label, shoutout to Empire, we were able to get independent distribution through them, and own our own record label, we can sign artists, we have artists, you know what I’m saying, we’re looking for artists, um\u0026hellip; but, even beyond that, we gon do films, you know what I’m saying? We gon get into the fashion business even heavier, you gon catch us at New York Fashion Week, you gon catch us at Complex Con, and you know, all these different places, like Come-Up Boys, the brand in itself, is gonna be way bigger than just music, that’s just our starting point, you know what I’m saying? [\u0026hellip;] One of my favorite Jay lines, I would have to say, was when he was like: “If skills sold / Truth be told / I\u0026rsquo;d probably be / Lyrically / Talib Kweli / Truthfully I wanna rhyme like Common Sense / But I made 5 mil, I ain\u0026rsquo;t been rhyming like Common since.” So to me, that right there was like yo, he lettin you know, lyrically I could be Talib Kweli, bro. Who was like one of the greatest, like come on! “Truthfully I wanna rhyme like Common, but I made 5 mil, I ain\u0026rsquo;t been rhyming like Common since,” like that shit is crazy, bro. You know what I’m saying? It lets you know what he about, it lets you know the intelligence of who he can be, and who he wants to be, and him understanding that. Most people don’t get that, you know what I’m saying? They know who they want to be, you know what I’m saying? They don’t know who they can be, though. They thinking too small. So you gotta know who you are, in a sense. At the same time, when you moving in this game, no matter what you doing, I don’t care if you a radio DJ, I don’t care if you a English major, a tech student [L and I laugh], whatever, you gotta know who the fuck you wanna be, and know who you are. And know what it’s gon take to get there. Like you know what I’m saying? That’s just that. \u003cbr/\u003eDJO: Especially like going to college here, you know some people feel like, they feel boxed in by their major, like they can only do one thing. \u003cbr/\u003eWM: Ay, none of them people that’s running this school man, they didn’t call you and say ay, you can only have one major, or you can only do this. Look\u0026hellip; here’s the pamphlet, here’s the book, you figure out who you wanna be. That’s what college is about, right? Okay so you gotta get out there, and you gotta try stuff, you know what I’m saying? You ain’t gon get it on the first go around. The first year you might have one major, second year you gotta switch to another major, whatever, you ain’t gon get it on the first go around! Don’t be afraid to fail, man! Michael Jordan said that, you know what I’m saying? And he got six rings! [Laughter in the studio.] This man is making billions off tennis shoes, and he just keep puttin out the same ones! [More laughter.] And I got a pair of em on, right now! \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJO: But I really think that’s the thing, like, everyone is so afraid of failure. Like, and I feel it’s like, not everyone, but like a majority, some people just afraid like “hey I failed I am gonna be discouraged I’m never gonna dip back into that again.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWM: Check it, if you afraid to fail, you might as well give up on life. I don’t care what it is! You gotta be willing to fail. Every L is a lesson. It’s not a loss, it’s a lesson. Only thing you lose is time. And you can’t get it back, right? But that lesson gon make up for the time that you lost. Because eventually you gon have to learn what not to do, in order to know what to do! \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI: What’s been your biggest L, and lesson? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWM: My biggest lesson. I’m gonna think. Hold on. Cause I’m gonna give you a good one. My biggest lesson\u0026hellip; would probably have to be trust yourself. Cause some people, they don’t do that, and they start listening—like everybody gon have an opinion, right? If you in the studio, and it’s like ten people in the studio. Or it’s five people in the studio. Everybody in that room is gonna have an opinion about the record. Sometimes you have to be able to listen to others, and take parts of what they saying, and apply, and sometimes, some people gon say stuff that, just, nah. And you gotta trust yourself in the moments, you get what I’m saying? So it’s about knowing that. I wanna say that’s probably my biggest lesson. And it was a L! There’s been times where I did not trust myself and I listened to other people, and that shit got me in trouble! You know what I’m saying? I don lost money behind that [laughs], for real, I don lost money behind that, I don got in trouble behind that. So trust in myself, man. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eListen to the full interview \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/space_odyssey/westside-mcfly-interview\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e and give “South Central Ain’t 4 Everybody” a listen on \u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/07PgnHSJbl1cegTu4bQo77?si=SZGRuTl4SLamKB1mEmHYDw\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSpotify\u003c/a\u003e now!

I grew up in awe of her soft, hazy glow, sitting for hours just to watch the moon rise, changing from a deep, earthen orange to an ethereal white as she made her way across the night sky.

They set up multiple telescopes, some pointed at the moon and some pointed at Mars, for students, teachers, and families alike to gaze through. Actual lunar samples from the Apollo missions could be viewed under microscopes, and attendees had the chance to observe models of instruments aboard the spacecraft (including a lunar drill, and a cushion Apollo Lunar Lander Seat that would have been used by the Apollo astronauts!). To aid in the learning experience, lunar experts roamed around, making themselves available to answer any and all questions and explain the work done here at UCLA.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2448\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/079ec4cfd7ecc6adb47353252b7c425e/tumblr_inline_pl8m8cf5Fp1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2448\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eThe event was a huge success\u0026ndash;we had hundreds of people across every age range show up to celebrate the beauty and mystery that the moon embodies.

Upon arriving to The Echo, completely unbeknownst to me was the size of the venue, which ended up allowing for some intimate photos. The concert opened with an emotional yet energetic performance from rapper Shaboozey, followed by rapper GLAM, with whom the audience absolutely fell in love as she created beats and rapped over them captivatingly during her set. After a short period of anticipation from the crowd, Duckwrth emerged onto a dark stage, beginning his first song at a mic stand inside a rectangular cube lined with color-changing LED lights. He then yanked off the mic and erupted into his classically vivacious stage personality, dancing almost erratically if not for the electric rhythm underlying his explosive Michael Jackson-esque dance moves, and the crowd pulsed with him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"1334\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f7bf5a7dbe21bd25772f25a138f4915e/tumblr_inline_pj8wbs0neD1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"1334\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"1290\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a4a81bf3d0db9adb8d00926f69b30c2d/tumblr_inline_pj8wcnjBSV1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"1290\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe rapper maintained an energy from the crowd that was altogether upbeat, adoring, and personal. He stayed engaged with the audience, even walking unceremoniously to the edge of the stage and stepping into the crowd, suddenly moshing with everyone mid performance. The most incredible part of the show was after of his song, “100 Days.” He proudly dedicated the song to his hometown of South Central, Los Angeles, proceeding to bring a solemn mood to the atmosphere as he noted the common pattern of disenfranchisement in the southern areas of cities. He warned the audience, telling them to make note of the lower quality of life in these areas and to understand that it results from a system of oppression. The mood seamlessly transitions from somber to ethereal as he proceeds into “Bernal Heights”, my personal favorite song of his, accompanied only by his steezy as fuck bass player, who was stationed behind him making awesome facial expressions throughout the show. During the song he began singing the Temptation’s “My Girl,” replacing “my girl” with “LA.” The audience blissfully swayed and sang along.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"1195\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5f559902b62b5b54cc48d7934e28fc30/tumblr_inline_pj8wbs1zNg1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"1195\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"702\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ed1874af8e87dfafe0164519a5af21e0/tumblr_inline_pj8wcmDQvp1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"702\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis concert ended and left me not with the usual post-concert depression that I experience after an impeccable performance but with optimism towards the future of mainstream rap, which I feel could benefit from a divergence from what’s become an extremely repetitive “xans/guns/bitches/lean” trope that seemed novel at a different time. Beyond his clever and poetically cocky, romantic lyrics, he exhibits a humility foreign to the rap scene. He stuck around after his show, taking photos and chatting with fans while sitting at the edge of the right corner of the stage. I had the chance to meet him. I complimented his photogeneity, thanked him for his dedication to artistic expression, and told him to check his DMs for photos lol (which he did \u0026lt;3). Before I took my friend’s photo with him, a woman, likely his mom, asked if he was ready to leave. He looked the handful of people lingering behind waiting to meet him, thought about it for a split second, then confidently told her that he wanted to stay. In response to what I’d just witnessed, I blurted out, “You’re awesome,” to which he laughed graciously. I’m so grateful for the experience, and I can’t wait to watch Duckwrth catapult into the success that he deserves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"792\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8b6eef1f3c5f555f573acdb818dcfa4f/tumblr_inline_pj8weh9Qkg1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1000\" data-orig-height=\"792\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

Her set at the 2018 Cloak \u0026amp; Dagger Fest was cathartic, transformative, and completely entrancing. After never having the opportunity to see SRSQ live, I walked out of her performance wondering when her next LA show would be. Live performances are supposed to be an experience, but time and time again I come to the conclusion that I shouldn’t put too much emphasis or hope into such fleeting moments. However that night I felt compelled and engaged and touched\u0026hellip; something very few shows execute, something of a rarity these days.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2304\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f7e4d44087d11513478015951d9cda1b/tumblr_inline_pix7vwqRRu1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2304\" data-orig-height=\"3456\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eEarly off in her set she started with “Cherish”. Which, as a song in itself, easily has the ability to set the mood. The space and crowd was made to feel light and ethereal right at the start, as if everyone in that room was drifting through a calm sea as one being. It’s interesting how her songs seemed to bleed into each other, even though there were very obvious breaks, even the lights completely dimmed after each song. To push the play metaphor further “Cherish” would have to be either the introduction or rising action. Which fits it very well, as luminous as the song was, it still felt heavy and dense, holding some sort of background variant like no other.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3456\" data-orig-height=\"2304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e45df843212bea1272d00988199f2f50/tumblr_inline_pix7w6y56k1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3456\" data-orig-height=\"2304\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe closed with “Permission”, which if anything was the climax of the set. The song alters her voice into a gender-bending siren, a pitch neither feminine nor masculine but a combination of both. “Permission” seems to be in a state of limbo in more states than one, the song is both slow yet pulsating, smooth yet harsh. That seems to be a common trend that follows both SRSQ and the crowd she attracted. Which is an ultimate existence the world should gear towards. Something in between the spectrum, neither right or wrong, left or right, dark or light. SRSQ does an amazing job of personifying that, whether it be through her gestures, fans, or music.\u003c/p\u003e",

It’s like… I swear to god it has gotten worse over the years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSC:\u003c/b\u003e Well as more humans are entering this place it’s only going to get worse.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eZ: \u003c/b\u003eYeah, they’re born and then they start driving and buy a car man.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSC: \u003c/b\u003eYeah, honestly we think LA traffic is bad right now but I don’t think it’s going to get any better than this. There is nowhere else to put all these people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eZ:\u003c/b\u003e Yeah, you know LA traffic is bad and like everybody complains about it. But it’s not just happening in LA it is everywhere dude, everywhere is bad. Like traffic in London, and Paris, Seattle, Chicago, it’s crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSC:\u003c/b\u003e At least in the larger cities, it’s just mind-boggling that it can take up to two hours to drive twenty miles. Okay, anyways\u0026hellip;don’t wanna\u0026hellip;make my mind more toxic than it already is by thinking about traffic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eZ: \u003c/b\u003e(laughs) There ya go.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSC:\u003c/b\u003e So uh now to the legit stuff. I read somewhere that you mentioned that FIDLAR was actually started as an experiment. I thought that was a really interesting way to explain the start of something, especially a band, could you expand on that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eZ:\u003c/b\u003e Yeah, it was kind of just like…I wanted to learn how to use the equipment, so I started writing songs and just goofing off and some of the first songs were like the first FIDLAR record songs. And that’s where I met Elvis, and me and Elvis started jamming together and it just kinda happened like that. It wasn’t like we were all buddies and kinda just liked jammed in the garage and was like oh we’re a band, like, it was more of an experiment than like a project, to learn how to use gear. I’ve always written songs, I never thought that I’d be in a band. That was really not like my focus, it really just kinda happened, you know what I mean? Rather than like… I didn’t move to LA to pursue a career in music. It’s weird how that works.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSC: \u003c/b\u003eRight, so it was kinda just taking that as a real hands-on classroom basically, to expand on what you knew.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eZ: \u003c/b\u003eYeah, I didn’t really finish school, I didn’t go to college really, like, it was mainly like I wanted to learn how to produce and I wanted to learn how to make records. And then, I kinda just stumbled upon this band, you know what I mean? It found a life of its own and I dunno, I think a big part of it is that we are not taking it seriously at all. (laughs)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSC:\u003c/b\u003e Which is good in a way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eZ:\u003c/b\u003e It’s just how it works I feel like. Ya know? I work with a lot of bands and I produce a lot of stuff, usually, the ones that are the most serious about it are usually the ones that aren’t having fun. It sounds forced ya know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSC:\u003c/b\u003e For sure, if you have any sort of plan or goal, your anxiety levels automatically increase and that kind of blocks everything within.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eZ:\u003c/b\u003e Totally.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSC:\u003c/b\u003e So your newer stuff, I listened to the last singles you guys put out and it’s pretty different from what you guys put out prior. The underlying root is pretty consistent but it is still really different, a little bit more complex. Did that change come about organically or was that a conscious decision? Also, do you think changing a bands’ sound is necessary or important to their evolution at all? Or just, to each their own.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eZ: \u003c/b\u003eUh, this comes up a lot where it’s like, I’m one of those kinds of people that need to change like I need to evolve, ya know what I mean? And there are some bands that don’t, and that’s like totally cool, and they kill it at what they do, and I love that. You know what I mean? We’re not NOFX, but I love NOFX, ya know what I mean. They make the same kinds of records over and over again and it’s good, they’re great records, and they solidified their songwriting, they are amazing ya know. Just for me personally, I got bored. We got bored with the same thing\u0026hellip;I got bored with playing the guitar you know what I mean. So it was like learning how to use drum machines and different kinds of synthesizers and stuff like that. I tend to be on the more evolving side of things. But I know that there are some bands that don’t do it, and I don’t think that’s a wrong way or anything.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSC:\u003c/b\u003e For sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eZ: \u003c/b\u003eI’m from Hawaii, so like we had punk bands play with reggae bands play with folk bands play with, you know, all kinds of different styles of music, we really didn’t have a specific scene, and that’s my generation, or just my friends and my people, we don’t just like one genre or one style of music, we like all kinds of stuff, ya know. I think that is a little bit of a newer generation kind of thing, you know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSC: \u003c/b\u003eYa, I feel like a lot of people nowadays feel like something belongs to their identity and if they step out of it, their scene might look down on them. But yeah, let’s move on from that. So how does it feel to drop new music after so long? Do you like the feedback or do you like to keep your head down?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eZ: \u003c/b\u003eIt’s been a long time since we’ve put out new music, so I’m pretty excited to start putting out new music. It’s been a long process to make, we tour a lot, ya know, so we have to designate time to be creative since we\u0026rsquo;re constantly on the road. I don’t know, I’m just really excited to be putting new music out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSC: \u003c/b\u003eYeah that’s awesome. Did you think that that kind of elongated silence is important to development at all? Like that, uncomfortable almost unease that comes with any sort of limbo period?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eZ: \u003c/b\u003eYeah, I think, well for us it took longer because we tour so much. So like, we’re not on a major label, we don’t have a lot of money here, we have to figure out how to do all that stuff while touring and being on the road. When you’re touring and being on the road a bunch, it limits your writing capabilities I feel like. You can come up with ideas and stuff like that but finding the time to sit down and write a song from start to finish and like having the band play it and stuff like that, it takes a while. It feels good to just be back at it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSC: \u003c/b\u003eOf course. So I know you’re really obsessed with tech and the production aspect. And you say you wouldn’t be here without it and all, which in a way no one would be here, just in general without it, in this form at least. It\u0026rsquo;s Basically the third and fourth industrial revolution. You said somewhere in two thousand years you think that we won’t even have music, that it would either be really sci-fi or obsolete. Are you implying that physical instruments would become obsolete?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eZ: \u003c/b\u003eI think so (laughs) I think so, I mean, you gotta look at history. Jazz isn’t really that popular, blues music isn’t really that popular anymore. Like, classical music is definitely not popular and there was a time where that was the biggest style of music, ya know. So, I mean, unfortunately, the guitar is\u0026hellip;companies aren’t selling guitars as much as they used to, it’s just the way the world works. It keeps going forward and it doesn’t look back. You have people that look back and appreciate it but, I don’t know, I think that’s the reality. The amount of technology that has boomed within the last five years is insane. Imagine in the next thousand years, we don’t know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSC:\u003c/b\u003e Are you one of those people that think that tech is seemingly gonna rule the world, or artificial intelligence, AI, per se, could end up ruling the world?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eZ: \u003c/b\u003eI can see that happening. I think that there is going to be, definitely like rules and laws against it\u0026hellip;it’s gonna be very highly restricted by the police. But I can totally see that happening. I think if anything we are going to get wiped out by a virus culture that we don’t know how to control or something. I think everybody is really scared of it taking over.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSC:\u003c/b\u003e Personally, I don’t think it would happen. I know by pure algorithm it could, it’s just hard to imagine that something we created will end up overtaking us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eZ:\u003c/b\u003e I can see that, if anything the discovery of different kinds of alien life forms will figure it out. But who knows?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSC:\u003c/b\u003e Yeah, whoever is alive then will deal with that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eZ: \u003c/b\u003eYeah they’ll figure it out, not my problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSC:\u003c/b\u003e So I just have two more questions, they’re a little bit more random to end the set. If there was a song or sound that would backtrack the birth of a child, an apocalypse, and Trump taking a shower, what would they be?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eZ:\u003c/b\u003e Maybe uh, R.E.M “It’s The End of The World”.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSC:\u003c/b\u003e Okay, classic. For all of them?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eZ: \u003c/b\u003eYeah. It’s a classic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSC:\u003c/b\u003e Okay last one. If there was one event that you could go back in time and experience what would it be? Anything before your lifetime is valid as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eZ:\u003c/b\u003e Uhh, that’s a tough question. Uh, man, okay. What about\u0026hellip; I don’t know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSC:\u003c/b\u003e Yeah this question is so simple yet so difficult at the same time, it really tells a lot about a person.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eZ:\u003c/b\u003e I know, I know, I know. I would like to see where I’m from, in Hawaii, before it was colonized by the British. The island of Ku’Ikahi. That would be my wish.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSC:\u003c/b\u003e Cool, that’s interesting. I haven’t had anyone answer anything even remotely close to that. Just anything before it was colonized would be a trip.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eZ: \u003c/b\u003eYeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSC:\u003c/b\u003e Okay cool, well that’s all that I have for you, thanks for your time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eZ:\u003c/b\u003e Awesome, well thanks for having me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eCatch soft cell on the experiMENTAL hospital, Mondays @ 7 \u003ca href=\"http://uclaradio.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003euclaradio.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Jack Harlow @ Catch One (11/1/2018) // Show Review",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eArticle and Photographs by Mahala Herron\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs an avid, yet newly recruited Jack Harlow fan, I knew I was in for a treat. I first heard of him when my friend played “NUN FREE” (featuring 2forwOyne) while we were shopping in San Francisco over the Summer. Since then, “PICKYOURPHONEUP” (featuring k. CAMP), “SUNDOWN,” and “Wasted Youth” have been on replay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI didn\u0026rsquo;t know until Wednesday that I would be able to attend his concert, and when I found out the venue I was honestly scared. I had attended a D. Savage concert at Catch One weeks prior, and when I tell you it was hectic, please believe me. The crowd was so aggressive that I left feeling so tense. It was so hot, everyone was pushing to the front and far too energetic. I was smack dab in the front of the concert and I fell on the stage countless amounts of times, and people were pulling my hair like crazy. Perhaps Catch One should do a better job of ensuring the safety of their guests because the D. Savage concert was a really uncomfortable event for me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e9b5a6f57691bf265f19da56907a8b48/tumblr_inline_phqlbfIebQ1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn a better note, Jack’s concert was far more chill. Outside of the event, waiting to get in, there was such a diverse crowd and in addition, they were all passionate about Jack and his music. In conversation with one of his fans, they pulled out the “Dark Night” cover photo on Soundcloud and elected to analyze why Jack was wearing his hoodie backwards, he was looking to dissect a deeper meaning. I figured Jack just put his hoodie on backward and perhaps felt it to be stylish. Other fans showed their passion in other ways, they had Jack Harlow merch on, sang their favorite songs in line, and were eager to experience the concert.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis was the first stop on The Loose Tour, and it began with the DJ playing all our favorite songs, “Nice for What” by Drake, “Mo Bamba” by Sheck Wes, “SICKO MODE” by Travis Scott, and more. Bobby Raps opened and I must say I am a true stan of versatility. What I liked about Bobby Raps is that he had trap beat bangers, then he completely surprised the crowd with a Prince-style song giving me groovy vibes and he was in falsetto for about 50% of the song! After Bobby’s performance, the crowd was then wow’d when Jack’s friend stood on the speakers, did backflips, and interacted with the crowd in a way that really got us ready for the evening's’ festivities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0ad204153ef74aa433629892091badcc/tumblr_inline_phqlbwe5wH1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eJack finally comes out to “SUNDOWN” and that’s when “‘ish got real.” The girls are crazy fans! They loved them some Jack Harlow. I was smack dab in the front middle of the stage, my position was more suited for a Harlow fanatic. I am merely a fan in comparison to these girls. Earlier I mentioned the chaos of the D. Savage concert, so if that was a 10 then I would put the chaotic energy of Jack’s concert at 5, everyone was just vibing to the music for the most part except those hopeful Harlow babymamas, they were wigging out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of Jack’s songs are hits. Every song makes you hype to hear it and his flows are slow enough to learn the words, yet clever enough to make you want to sing along. Jack is such a charismatic performer, he has a charming energy on stage and even when he’s focused he is still present with his fans. The vibes of the beat are smooth yet tactical. I would play a Jack Harlow song if I was on a secret mission and I needed to get in my zone. The energy of the live performance made for a great time. Jack was kind enough to shake hands, and he even took a video in my phone. I know the tour will only grow with time, and by this time next year he will be selling out arenas.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/8afa1e06bc9da3f59297b3a0a6b7e0ab/tumblr_inline_phqlc7YxdM1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" data-orig-width=\"3024\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e~Hala at Mahala (@MahalaHerron//Twitter)\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Climate change, system change, and… education change?",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003earticle by Sophia Donskoi\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat do schools, climate change, and all 50 states have in common? Nothing, inherently. That’s surprising, considering the United States is one of the world’s main contributors to climate change. Fortunately, the country is beginning to adopt policies that work toward more sustainable goals, such as sourcing renewable energy and banning single-use plastics. Scientists, politicians, and both the public and private sectors recognize the unavoidable impacts of climate change, but many districts around the country refuse to teach climate science to the generations that will be most affected by it. Education is vital to the understanding of climate change, and we must arm students with the necessary knowledge to help continue the United States’ progress toward sustainability.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEducation policy is under the jurisdiction of the state, not federal, governments. Various national policies such as the bipartisan No Child Left Behind Act have attempted to remedy discrepancies among varying state educational standards. Both teachers’ unions and educational reform advocates agree that these standards should be uniform to make the jobs of teachers more manageable and benefit students.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e Forty-six percent of Americans believe their country’s education in science, technology, engineering, and math is “below average,” according to a Pew Report. These Americans wouldn’t be far from correct, considering 20% of American 15 year-olds had low proficiency in science, falling short of international standards. It’s unfortunate that we haven’t yet found a solution that will push students ahead in one of the most important fields of their time. Unsurprisingly, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the two fastest-growing jobs in the U.S. are both science and climate-related: solar panel installers and wind turbine technicians. Clearly, students could benefit from not just science education, but climate education in particular. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome states like Wyoming (the state with the most carbon emissions per capita, surprise!) refuse to mandate climate change education— likely because informing students could lead to downfalls in the states’ oil and coal industries. But a downfall in those industries is exactly what America needs. By educating all students in this country on the foundations of climate change, we can effectively prepare them for what lies ahead: a climate-conscious economy and workforce. The journey to organized climate education isn’t long or arduous, considering a team of 40 scientists has already developed a system that’s been adopted in 26 states. Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) set standards for science courses that emphasize the human contributions to climate change and its effects on the Earth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe need a national movement toward the NGSS so we can implement standards across state borders as soon as possible. Climate change is inevitable, so why can’t climate education be? Students have a right to know what lies ahead for them and their posterity as much as they have a right to learn in school, regardless of which polluting companies monopolize their individual states. When we adopt Next Generation Science Standards nationwide, we can leave the country united against the biggest problem facing humanity. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "The Much Much How How and I - Cosmo Sheldrake // Album Review",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003earticle by Mark McGreal\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe Much Much How How and I \u003c/i\u003eis the most recent album by Cosmo Sheldrake, a British instrumentalist. The album came out in April of 2018, so it isn’t exactly new, but I only recently became aware of it due to a new Apple commercial for the iPhone XR. In the commercial, hundreds of people dressed in different monochromatic jumpsuits run through city streets while Sheldrake’s “Come Along” plays in the background. Personally, it’s a very rare occasion for a commercial to catch my attention at all, but I enjoyed the song so much, that I found the song and discovered my new favorite artist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, a little background on the artist. Cosmo Sheldrake (yes that is his real name), was born in December, either in 1989 or 1991 depending on which website you use to look it up. He can play keyboard, guitar, drums, the banjo, and the sousaphone. He is the son of a renowned parapsychologist and a voice coach, and his brother Merlin (once again, that is his real name) is a biologist. His songs fall into the electronica and folkloric genres. His first single, titled “The Moss” was released in 2014, and he released an EP in 2015, but this album is his first full-length album.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn important thing about Sheldrake is that he is an independent currently. He is signed to no label, and he puts the music out himself. Without corporate intervention, Sheldrake can make any music that he wishes exactly the way he wants to make it. He should be commended for such a brave move.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe Much Much How How and I\u003c/i\u003e is a fantastical album. The song “Linger Longer”, the first song on the album, uses the instruments in such a way that conjures up images of a circus or a ballet. The tempo is quick, each instrument plays its notes quickly and then moves on to the next almost as if the songs are in constant motion. The drums are the strongest instrument; they create a consistent beat that keeps the songs moving. It keeps the albums from becoming bogged down. The sousaphone is used extensively in the album. It gives each song a nice beautiful and rich tone. It can also be used to create a beat like the drums, but it is not as harsh to the ear.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe lyrics in the songs are arguably their most important aspects. The songs are each chock-full of references and allusions to literature. The name of 17th-century literary character Tom Thumb is in expressly said in “Wriggle”, and “Eggs and Soldier”make some not so subtle references to both Jack from Jack and the Beanstalk and Jack from Jack and Jill. These references to fairy tale characters further the whimsical nature of the album. It’s hard to discern a theme from the album because of the nonsense poem nature of each song. They all feel so disjointed, but Sheldrake’s style binds the songs together to create songs that flow, one right into the next.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt 14 songs, the album makes for an easy listen. The songs tempos are almost universal. Personally, I have listened to the songs while going on contemplative walks, while working out at the gym, and while doing schoolwork. I’m even listening to it as I write this piece at this moment. I would recommend this album to any and all people who are looking for a talented musician. To paraphrase Sheldrake’s song “Come Along” run away from the humdrum and listen to this talented and interesting young artist.\u003c/p\u003e",

Doors opened at 10:45pm and what I love about NOVO is the first 50 or so visitors get to stand in the barricade. We all flock in and the concert begins on time. While doors opened at 10:45 Blueface wasn\u0026rsquo;t scheduled to come on until 1, so the crowd did get a little impatient but we had openers such as Salah Baby, N.L.U., FT Hop Out, and so on. About half of the openers were from the Bay Area, which is something I admire about Blueface, how he shows love to NorCal being that he is an LA artist, he’s not strictly LA, he’s West Coast. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe comes out to “Thottiana”, another banger that the crowd knows and loves. In his usually Burberry fit, girls are throwing their bras and underwear with their phone numbers drawn on, from the balcony. There were about 50 people on stage with him and while they didn’t serve as entertainment, I can say that they aided in keeping the show lively. As I imagine it being hot, eventually Blueface strips down to his pants and throws a whole case of water from bottles on stage at the crowd and all of those 50 people who got the pleasure of entering the barricade were delightfully drenched.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3024\" data-orig-height=\"4032\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/65f270103fc16c5e099d36caad4cfc51/tumblr_inline_plk48wZAQF1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3024\" data-orig-height=\"4032\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I first heard of Blueface it was regarding his funny mannerisms and antics. I heard the song “Blow her Bacc” which genuinely made me laugh because of the lyrics, “That must be jelly cause jam don’t shake like that.” Blueface first got his co-sign from Drake, who said, “Next big thing and Dead Loccs so hardddd been my anthems I put mad people on.” These days in music, I’ve noticed stars such as Cardi B paving a way and setting a standard of a sparkling personality to accompany the music, and Blueface has that. During the entire show he was super interactive with the crowd, having the ability to reach even the balcony with his attention. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"683\" data-orig-height=\"1087\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/561ba9c6de310313a7fcf9642ea7af9b/tumblr_inline_plk494zAUY1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"683\" data-orig-height=\"1087\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy favorite songs from his set were “Famous Cryp” and “Studio.” He brought out special guests such as Almighty and French Montana. The crowd was genuinely surprised and excited to see French come out and while I understand it wasn’t his show, I wish he could have at least performed one of his hit songs like, “Unforgettable.” Admirable enough, Blueface seems to have a lot of respect already as a new artist from his counterparts in the industry. His fans love him so much, and even I was converted into a fan and I ended up leaving the concert saying “Blueface Babyyy” (in his voice) every chance I got. I also left the concert with a new respect for Blueface, seeing how much his fans adore him and finally getting to understand why. \u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "On Steve Alford // Sports",
    "content": "\u003ch2\u003eBy Holding onto Steve Alford, UCLA is Accepting Mediocrity and Underachievement for its Legendary Basketball Program\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003earticle by Ben Hunter\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEver since the day Steve Alford was hired in Westwood, he had his critics for a fair reason. It began because of his mishandling of a sexual assault case while at Iowa, and it has continued since it has become apparent he is a mediocre coach. There was some justification for holding onto Alford after another underachieving season last year, going out in the First Four to St. Bonaventure. The reasoning hinges on the fact that Alford has been a decent recruiter, and he has steered clear of scandals that have recently plagued college basketball. Despite this, holding onto him is still not justified. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll things considered, Alford’s successful recruiting is nothing to be applauded. His standard of recruiting should be the expectation. UCLA is a college basketball blue blood, with the most all-time championships at 11. John Wooden, one of the greatest coaches in \u003ci\u003eall of sports\u003c/i\u003e, and legends of the game like NBA all-time scoring leader Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Walton, and Reggie Miller, among others, made their names here. In addition, UCLA is located in Westwood, one of the best areas in all of Los Angeles, which is already a destination for recruits and an extremely fertile recruiting ground. Because of this prime location and esteemed culture of winning, recruiting a top-10 class every year should be the expectation, not something to be praised. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe FBI probe has shown the dark side of college basketball over the last year or two. UCLA has kept its nose clean, which actually is something to be applauded. However, we should still be firing Alford, because almost any coach would be better than him, even if it meant eliminating preferred candidates who we can’t be sure are innocent in this investigation. Even if UCLA hired a coach who had to be fired, Alford has underachieved so much that this hypothetical program turnover would still be better, assuming the contract is properly structured so that firing a coach with cause results in no compensation to him. Following an exit from last year’s tournament to a St. Bonaventure side with significantly less talent and resources, the fact that Alford was retained essentially condones the fact that for four out of five years of Alford has led underachieving teams. Names like Nevada’s Eric Musselman and then Xavier’s Chris Mack seemed like no-brainers to be willing to come to Westwood and be more successful Alford, but Alford was held onto. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnly in the 2014-15 has Alford’s team outperformed its projection. That actually might not be the case, as the argument can be made that they underperformed during the regular season. The team featured the likes of Kevon Looney, Norman Powell, Isaac Hamilton, and Tony Parker, so a Sweet Sixteen exit could hardly be considered an overachievement. The year before’s team featured three first-round draft picks in Jordan Adams, Kyle Anderson, and Zach LaVine, and they went out in the Sweet Sixteen. UCLA missed the tournament altogether in 2015-16, which had plane banners flying overhead saying “March Madness is not firing Steve Alford.” The much-hyped Bruins in 2016-17, featuring Lonzo Ball, TJ Leaf, Tom Welsh, Aaron Holiday, Isaac Hamilton, Bryce Alford and more went out in the Sweet Sixteen after looking for most of the year like they had championship-caliber talent. Last year, as explained, we lost to St. Bonaventure, who in no scenario, considering last year’s squad, should we have lost to. The shock of losing this match due to the name brands alone could result in a coach’s firing. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis many years of underachievement can’t be a coincidence. It all points back to one thing: coaching. It’s also not as if we don’t witness the lack of coaching. Alford’s hesitance to call timeouts, make in-game adjustments, and his look of bewilderment during games have become jokes and “memes” among UCLA fans. Alford doesn’t call timeouts early in opposing teams’ scoring runs to stop their momentum, despite this being standard practice in the basketball world; presumably, this is because he doesn’t know how to address it during the timeout. This could be seen in Las Vegas over Thanksgiving early in the game versus Michigan State. Last night versus Notre Dame, Notre Dame switched to a 2-3 zone in the second half, and UCLA couldn’t figure out how to break it, a common theme during Alford’s tenure. The team looked bewildered, operating out of a 3-high, 2 low, look which is a common zone offense. However, instead of featuring quick ball movement, handoffs from the guards, flashes to the short corner and high post from the post players, or zone screens from the bigs, they stood around and played sluggishly. No adjustments were made, and UCLA resorted to contested jumpers, allowing Notre Dame to get back into the game. A clutch shot from Kris Wilkes won it at the horn, but that shouldn’t hide the fact that this game was close because of a lack of preparation and in-game coaching, and because it was close, this win will likely not boost our tournament resume, since Notre Dame has looked weak this year. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUCLA should be the gold standard of college basketball, alongside Duke, UNC, Kentucky, and Kansas. Instead, UCLA is an underachieving basketball program who usually brings in some talent, fails to accomplish much, and sees that talent move onto the NBA. Our last sustained period of success occurred under Ben Howland when we made three straight final fours from 2006-2008. Howland achieved much more than Alford and was fired for much less, although his recruiting suffered towards the end of his tenure, resulting in less talented teams. Regardless, Steve Alford must be shown the door at the end of this year in Westwood, if not sooner, unless he makes a surprising run in March. This team probably has Elite 8talent on it, but the performances so far look like we’ll be lucky to win one or two games in the tournament. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the day, winning is what matters to the fans for all sports in Westwood, especially basketball. Dan Guerrero and UCLA athletics, though, seem to be sending messages that this is not the case. There is a reason so many protest banners have flown over our beautiful campus over the last few years. Barring an impressive finish to this season, Steve Alford must be relieved of his duties, and UCLA must invest in a top-tier coach who has proven ability and is capable of restoring Bruin Basketball to its former greatness. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

More heartbreaking to this devilish seemingly infinite saga, is the fact that his performances are generally analogous to each other. That being said it wasn’t a surprise that his show at the Regent Theater aligned with his algorithm, what did come as a surprise though, was how exponentially his ability to provoke emotion grew. Seeing Maus for what would now make my fourth time, I had a relatively sound idea as to how I would feel when walking out of the theater, however, this time was different.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009He started his set off with “Castle In The Grave”, which is consistent with his usual light and carefree sound that everyone is known to love, given how apocalyptic his latest record \u003ci\u003eAddendum\u003c/i\u003e sounds. The crowd, as always, was into it-there is this sort of unspoken truth about John Maus that seems to captivate and excavate any given audience at all times. As the world continues to cruise, tragedy and turmoil progressively insert themselves into the various epochs of time. John Maus, just like everyone else, is well aware of it, him making it particularly clear through \u003ci\u003eAddendum\u003c/i\u003e and his latest performances, despite the amiable characteristics of his following songs like “Keep Pushing On”. However none of that seems to be on purpose, not like a form of performance art or anything, just an extension of his self.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3456\" data-orig-height=\"2304\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d5b5930939867bd47fc65e28346c087d/tumblr_inline_pjwwojdsdQ1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3456\" data-orig-height=\"2304\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009It’s a strange and dark thing to learn about the world. Given Maus’ level of ability, he might have learned a little too much. He’s had a hellish past year, personal tragedies that can majorly blow the best out of their flow. His live performances might have come out of their plateau because of this. He attempts to put out the rawest form of himself that this restrained existence will allow. Everything is stripped away-him, the audience, and his music amalgamates with one another. He stands to reach his threshold, naked and barrier-less and attacks his demons while allowing the audience to gage and gouge theirs. The raving body has this ability to reach an element of truth and to transcend whatever province it desires. Maus’ live excorsitic tendencies reveal the necessity to push oneself, to manipulate the body and mind past their apex. The thought that you are already “there” is a serene one, but all of Maus’ performances seem to seek past this, past the “there”, and I don’t think that it’s a bad thing at all, it’s really extravagant actually.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2304\" data-orig-height=\"3456\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9bc3eeb42d1f74d7f31689f27147762e/tumblr_inline_pjwwp2cW5K1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2304\" data-orig-height=\"3456\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Once he began “And Heaven Turned To Her Weeping” something changed in the air. Everything went dark and everyone felt different. Once a soothing lullaby, this cycle it was transformed into a soft power cry into the beyond. The lyrics themselves are melancholy enough but combined with the current climate, everyone found something special within it that they were able to take home. I for one had tears in my eyes, and just from a simple glance around the crowd it was easy to verify that I wasn’t the only one, not only throughout this song but also “Do Your Best”. Music such as Maus’, with this sort of upbeat sound and demeanor shouldn’t exactly evoke tears, but just like it is already known, nothing has the ability to erupt and elevate your insides quite like John Maus. How close is John Maus to his “there”? I don’t know, he doesn’t know, how is anyone supposed to even know when they are in fact “there”. All I know is that he’s probably as close as anyone is going to get, and I sure as hell was a step closer because of it.\u003c/p\u003e",

The title immediately took me back to my high school economics class (shout out to you, Mr. Torres), where we learned that the analogy of “guns and butter” referred to the allocation of government spending on defense (“guns”) and civilian resources (“butter”). A$AP Rocky is a famously apolitical artist, who on numerous occasions has responded to reporters’ political questions with comments such as \u0026ldquo;don\u0026rsquo;t ask me no shit like that on camera sweetheart,\u0026rdquo; and his release of a song like “Gunz N Butter” was seemingly out of character. However, Testing in itself is a more experimental, creative step out of Rocky’s comfort zone, who for a good portion of the album’s production, created music under the influence of psychedelics. The meaningful lyricism of the song cites spirituality, the current presidency, and inequity in society, but the music video takes the entirety of “Gunz N Butter” even further with its powerful visuals.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe opening shot is Rocky sitting atop an old Mercedes marked with his signature black and yellow car testing dummy symbol. The camera zooms to the windows of the car, on which videos of the dummies play. The faceless, child-sized dummies sit in a classroom, where the sounds of gunshots fire in the background as a teacher dummy “teaches”. An explosion occurs, and viewers are taken to a commercial for “Guns \u0026amp; Butter Lights” cigarettes which are marketed by a white man as “fresher, smoother, bolder.” This is likely Rocky’s commentary on big tobacco and big corporations taking advantage of the public.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe theme of the inherent power and evil of large corporations continues as music resumes and the video cuts to a factory farm with thousands of chickens, then a meat processing plant, then a dark cattle pen, and finally to hanging cow carcasses. A$AP Rocky portrays the meat process as unethical, disturbing, and grotesque in a matter of seconds as the cuts are paired with the dramatic sound of gunshots that are a part of the song. Rocky himself is a known vegetarian and once said, “you gotta go do research on the way they treat like f*****g chickens, man. Those chickens go through f*****g torture before they’re processed and s**t, have all sorts of f*****g steroids injected in them and everything.” Clearly, Rocky wanted to portray his beliefs and expose the cruelty with the platform that his new video, which is currently over _____ views utilizes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe video then makes a switch to a different kind of processing: information and technology. Newspapers run across a printing press and a 3D Printer quickly prints a gun,  drawing a comparison between the availability and prevalence of news in America and the availability and prevalence of guns in America. Phone screens move down a manufacturing belt, followed by a bird’s eye of what looks to be a packaging warehouse with employees dressed in yellow. This warehouse is presumably one run by a large corporation such as Amazon that takes advantage of warehouse workers and brings up questions about the conditions of said employees. There is a quick shot to a large, Walmart-esque store with “G\u0026amp;B” signs and customers milling through it like they are no longer human. Through this series of shots, Rocky again pushes the agenda that large corporations are taking value from society and pushing an agenda that dehumanizes and desensitizes America.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe camera zooms out on a group of Navy sailors holding rifles through the lens of the barrel of a handgun being cleaned by a white teenage boy. The boy’s room is postered, one of which reads “The Golden Butter,” another analogy to the large “G\u0026amp;B” corporation. The shot is ominous as nobody knows (but everyone can assume) what the boy will do with his gun. There is a quick moment of comedic relief as the shot reveals a man and a woman holding a glass of rose quickly having sex in the kitchen. Children who are the testing dummies come-to-life smoke G\u0026amp;B cigarettes in a sterile room with their arms tied through straps on their jumpsuits; they are helpless, yet tough. A white man in camo, a distinctly Southern pattern, drives his adolescent son who is holding a rifle on the back of his pickup truck. The features of both of the young white men with guns in this portion of the video scream “school shooter.” According to a Mother Jones database of U.S. mass shootings since 1982, 54 percent US mass shootings have been carried out by white men.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRocky crowd surfs through a performance during his next shot of comedic relief that includes an ad-lib from Yams day in 2018, where an altercation occurred backstage and A$AP was called by Hector Delgado to address it. Next, a young boy in a Christian household peacefully eats his cereal as outdoors a group of Ku Klux Klan members assembles. Rocky’s most political line in the song plays: “So get up off my YKK [a euphemism for Rocky’s genitalia alluding to the biggest zipper manufacturer in the world], the President a a-hole (fuck off) Prayin\u0026rsquo; for a JFK, all we got was KKK.”  The KKK members burn a cross, and consequently, themselves. They are a self-destructive result of the society that has created them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome heavily tattooed, and again, white, males clean handguns nonchalantly in a kitchen. Around their neighborhood, a large squadron of snipers walks toward a large and powerful structure with the Testing symbol on it. Perhaps they were sent by the government to remove the dissenting Testing experimental thinkers while they blindly miss (or ignore) the injustices that occur in their plain sight. A$AP Rocky is seen off where he started on the Testing car which now plays American commercials on the windows, and in the last few seconds, Rocky breaks through the front windshield.\u003c/p\u003e",

I’m from Haifa, Israel originally.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJo: \u003c/b\u003eI’m Jo and I’m an LA-bred songbird \u0026amp; songwriter. My brother actually played on the UCLA soccer team that won the national championship! Go, Bruins!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eYour cult-like yet delicate branding is eye-catching and extremely well-curated, what were the creative processes behind your cover arts and music videos?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJo \u0026amp; Anna: \u003c/b\u003eThank you! Our aesthetic has been developed through years of trial and error and cultivating our own tastes. Now that we know what resonates with us, we’re able to collaborate with amazing artists to help make our vision a reality. For our EP cover art, we envisioned everything and worked with a few key people that really fit our style. Each video sort of represents a different room in the tour of our minds; most recently the hazy, jungle-like setting for our live video of “Pusher”. We have been surrounded by an amazingly talented community of artists who we trust and have been inspired by!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eIt’s super cool that Joyeur is a self-produced, self-written duo. Who are some of your favorite female musicians/producers in today’s industry?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJo \u0026amp; Anna: \u003c/b\u003eThere are a lot of female producers on the rise who are gaining attention and making a name for themselves right now. It’s really exciting. Some women who produce that we dig are Bjork, Grimes, Tokimonsta, Isabella Summers (of Florence and The Machine), and Rezz.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003ePop music is getting drastically diverse in recent years and your sounds are definitely very different from mainstream pop. How exactly would you describe your music?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJo \u0026amp; Anna: \u003c/b\u003eEccentric. At times, we’re integrating funk, electronic, rock, and even hip-hop elements, but the common denominator we keep is the feeling of power. There is always ferocity, sexuality, a sense of humor and an urge to be free coursing through the DNA of our songs. We want our listeners to feel indestructible. I guess you could call it power pop.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDescribe your studio routine?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJo: \u003c/b\u003eIt depends on how we start a song. We can start an idea separately or together, but we are usually eager to move forward with something that sparks us both equally. We try to get it out of our systems as quickly as possible and then question things afterward. We don’t allow our internal critiques into the room until the idea is completely outside ourselves. We always have the mic warmed up and ready to go because magic often happens when we’re improvising. Anna will jump from one synth to another while I’m brainstorming and singing. Not everything starts as exciting. Sometimes we each need our own space and will take time apart with an idea before we exchange our visions and take a song farther.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eI’m assuming you two came from very different backgrounds, both musically and culturally. How has collaborating with each other and forming a band together changed your creative processes/lives in general?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAnna: \u003c/b\u003eLike in any relationship, opposites attract. We are fascinated by each other because we are so different. If Jo plays me a song and I just don’t get it, I’m curious as to why that is. Part of our process is to really expand ourselves and remain curious about our differences. We also found that we can have different creative processes that really compliment each other. I am more structured and calculated while Jo can be more of an impulsive, on-the-spot creator. What we really have in common is our desire to be outside of our comfort zone and that’s something we’ve kept intact from the beginning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJo:\u003c/b\u003e Really, though. We have always been able to share a vision and what has kept our momentum is that we like to hang out. We like a lot of the same things and that’s important with someone you spend most of your time with!  \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTell us more about your debut EP \u003ci\u003eLIFEEATER\u003c/i\u003e?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eJo \u0026amp; Anna: \u003c/b\u003eThis is our first time getting our music out there. It’s so exciting to be able to share our combined experiences and explorations as musicians and humans in general. \u003ci\u003eLIFEEATER \u003c/i\u003eis a collective anthem of boldness and desire.

The Melbourne based band’s recently released “Mammal Love” is fast and groovy. Via Zak Brown’s characteristic nasally spoken vocals the song explores themes of liking music a lot and caring about people! Guaranteed a “who is this?” when you put it on the aux in your friend\u0026rsquo;s car to which you can drop your knowledge. When they inevitably give you a “??” when you tell them its “Easy Browns Truckstop Chicken Jam Band,” give them the down low on this hip Aus band you just found. Perfect way to express your superiority and establish your hold on the aux without being too much of a pretentious asshole. If you, like myself, can’t afford to catch that plane down under, grab their tunes on Bandcamp or hit them with a stream on Spotify.

    "title": "Molly Burch @ The Bootleg Theater (10/26/18) // Show Review",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eArticle and photographs by Gomi Zhou\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNight times in Los Angeles are getting more and more chilly day by day, and my willingness for these late concerts has been going down relative to the temperature as well. The area around the Bootleg wasn’t exactly the safest, plus I’ve never been a fan of wide, open and echoey streets. Once I walked out of my Uber, I immediately started to pace myself with caution\u0026ndash;damn I wish I didn’t procrastinate on inviting a friend to come with me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlready feeling the stress from midterms on my shoulders, I got there five minutes before the designated set time for the opening act, Jesse Woods. Being the only lively spot in sight, there was already a line in front of the theater, making it stand out even more from the rest of the neighborhood. After being greeted by a kind security guard who genuinely believed I had a New York accent (I’m from southern China), I was then welcomed by a table full of tiny gifts from the performers. There were things ranging from business cards to matches, all were up for grabs. On the big screen in the middle of the open bar area, was the longest Dodger game in history. Everyone was already getting kind of boozed, but the line at the bar was still going at it. Luckily, I used the distractions of the Dodgers and alcohol to my benefits and got to the front rows successfully.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3648\" data-orig-width=\"5472\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/21c177a0f8e30d7c3f3896e7e3bf1cce/tumblr_inline_phl2a4szGh1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3648\" data-orig-width=\"5472\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo my surprise, there were quite a few people who came for the opening act. As a city kid for my whole life, I (sadly) never really understood the essence of folk music. It might’ve been the booze, or people were just genuinely dancing their hearts out to Jesse’s calming, acoustic sounds. The two girls in front of me were the most dedicated fans to any opening acts I’ve ever seen, wearing western dresses and cowboy hats while singing every line back at the performer, holding up their phones and filming the whole thing. By the time Molly Burch and her band came onto the stage, the sold-out Bootleg was completely packed with hipsters of all sort (seriously, all sort. There were lo-fi gamers, emo girls who love MCR, and like, the hipster hipsters, of course). Some women in their early 30s were excitedly cheering with a slightly flirtatious manner, and many others were already dancing to the imaginary melodies in their heads.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll the chaos around somehow helped me focus on Molly’s echoey voice even more. I’ve always been amazed by her deep, rich and theatrical voice. She has the kind of voice that can easily bring you back to an easier, less confusing but also beautifully dazed era of Hollywood. In a simple plaid dress, she kept moving her arms with certainty and confidence, drawing invincible semi-circles and grabbing in an almost metaphorical way. Unlike many artists today, who could be over-occupied by the chaos of being on stage and performing in front of a crowd, Molly was completely in control of her own music. She owns her music, both literally but also figuratively. She knew exactly how to treat every single note, and she was confident about it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3519\" data-orig-width=\"5278\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/16522b4618d754fca212e160e893cc4c/tumblr_inline_phl2cnxvSE1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3519\" data-orig-width=\"5278\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut when she wasn’t singing, it was almost like she was a completely different person. Less confident, but in a good way, Molly talked to the crowd in a quiet, charming voice. She talked about her roots in Los Angeles, her love for her sister and what each song meant to her. Specifically, the performance of “Every Little Thing” after an emotional talk, was thrillingly beautiful with her uniquely rich voice. One high note after another, the song became a vivid story on its own. I don’t think anyone who was there that night would ever be able to listen to the song without getting emotional ever again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3648\" data-orig-width=\"5472\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6f31677fb46acdb1c99daacf6e37d447/tumblr_inline_phl2dn2APm1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3648\" data-orig-width=\"5472\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eI especially love artists who are confident with their own music yet also know how to be humble and kind in person\u0026ndash;Molly was definitely one of them. After the show, she stood behind her own merch stand and started greeting everyone with the biggest smile on her face (while the Dodger game continued in the background). Midnight was approaching, but I no longer felt like this night was unworthy. It was the opposite, it was inspiring and thrilling, the exact opposite of unworthy.\u003c/p\u003e",

That being said, I was looking forward to seeing Noname live.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"4032\" data-orig-height=\"3024\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a7b07d8eb60dba2c140a5555c0b8b66e/tumblr_inline_pnirefHsMR1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4032\" data-orig-height=\"3024\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy friend and I arrived a bit late and the floor was quite crowded but we were able to meet up with some other people and get an OK spot. After waiting for a bit, the opener, Elton, came on. I had never heard anything from Elton before and after the first few tracks, I realized it was not something I would typically listen to. His performances were quite funky or jazzy, in a style similar to but still very different from Noname. He also brought out a few people, including Phoelix, who is featured in a lot of Noname tracks as well. One notable moment in Elton’s performance was his cover of an Andre 3000 song but otherwise, once his performance ended, I was looking forward to Noname coming on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"4032\" data-orig-height=\"3024\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e1fc4329b859364dde4127b729be0492/tumblr_inline_pniren4wYu1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4032\" data-orig-height=\"3024\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter around 30-40 minutes of waiting, the lights dimmed and a bright neon “ROOM 25″ sign lit up. She opened with “self”. She continued with other favorites like “Blaxploitation” and “Prayer Song”. Other memorable moments were when she performed “Ace” and some of her tracks from \u003ci\u003eTelefone\u003c/i\u003e like “Bye Bye Baby”. Overall, the instrumentation was superb, probably one of my favorite parts; her band and backup singers were the highlights of the night. Noname herself was amazing live; her flow, like on the studio versions, is incredible and just hearing the tracks themselves live was powerful and moving.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"4032\" data-orig-height=\"3024\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7b44a0fa2165e609322c40105bd2e051/tumblr_inline_pnireuGKk31qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4032\" data-orig-height=\"3024\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere were some qualms I had about the show, specifically the length. Noname’s set was around 40-45 minutes, including her encore (an acapella version of “Shadow Man”) but this was to be expected since \u003ci\u003eRoom 25\u003c/i\u003e itself is only around 35 minutes long. A lot of the tracks on her albums also have incredible features but she only was able to bring out Phoelix. I was disappointed that Saba and Smino didn’t come out to perform “Ace” since Saba’s verse in “Ace” was one of my favorites in the entire album, but since they were both touring, it was expected. Also, she was pretty high throughout the entire show and the audience could tell but honestly, it added to her show, which was overall, really amazing. Noname herself was charming, likable, and most of all, very genuine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"4032\" data-orig-height=\"3024\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/12610c7fc9333879b029c86625f1823b/tumblr_inline_pnirf4cnEZ1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4032\" data-orig-height=\"3024\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eRoom 25\u003c/i\u003e was such a monumental album for me in 2018 and seeing it live was incredible, regardless of the small hiccups and I’ll be listening to \u003ci\u003eRoom 25\u003c/i\u003e on repeat (again) for the next few days.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Interview with Tritonal @ the Hollywood Palladium",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eInterviewed by Jenny Tong (On behalf of Deep End Theory)\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eWe were able to catch Chad and David from Tritonal during their show at the Hollywood Palladium.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHey everyone, I’m Jenny. And who are we with today?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChad: My name is Chad.\u003cbr/\u003eDavid: And I’m David and we’re Tritonal!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSo there’s a debate about how to pronounce that.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChad: Right, it’s “Tri-tone-al”. So a tritone is a diminished fifth and augmented fourth. It’s a chord.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eGot it. What excites you the most about the “U\u0026amp;Me” Tour? \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChad: We have developed a completely new show that is projection mapping. We’re running time-coded visuals onto a structure, so every video has lightings with pixelated strobes. It’s a new experience for our fans, essentially. It’s a ton of work setting up and taking down, a big undertaking with a large crew. I feel like most DJ shows and festivals you go to always have LED walls, like a big square wall or wall arrangements, and we’ve been playing on festivals and done a lot of hard ticket tours, buses etc., and have done LED walls for 6-7 years. So we were like, let’s do something new, let’s bring it back to how it used to be, go back to darker, lights, lasers, people moving dancing and enjoying themselves. We are just trying to do something different for us and for the fans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWe know it’s been a while since you’ve last released an album. What was the rationale of putting it out this year and what was the creative process behind the album?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDavid: Honestly we like making music all the time. The funny thing is, we were making so much music, we thought we could put out an album.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChad: And then we doubled it. The album now comes to around 20 tracks. We keep making music and they’re like “well, there’s another album”. With Painting with Dreams, there was a story, and this one has one too like Dave was saying, we were really got into a rhythm of doing what we were trying to do. We would love it if we could release a track every three to four weeks, but we constantly get kickback from the label we own. We have a 20-person team in London that runs in, and we’ve got Ahmed and Joe, and managers think it’s good to release music but it’s also good for people to sit with the music and marinate for a while. We’ve been highly prolific with “track, remix, album, track, remix, mashup”. We love making tracks and we’re just like done, next! And sometimes it is too much. So an album is a great way to release a big body of work that you’ve been working on for a while. And this one, in particular, has a lot of music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eIs there any reason why it’s called “U \u0026amp; ME”?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChad: Yes, because we feel like there is massive divisiveness in our culture right now in the United States between everyone. It’s your race versus mine, your political agenda versus mine, your beliefs versus mine … Everyone is using their false sense of self to propagate the idea of “me and the other”, the otherness of others … but there isn’t that much otherness of others. We’re more connected and unified than we think. The media propagates this all the time, and what we see at our shows is that people at all walks of life come to enjoy the music in the same way, and care about each other in the same way. So really it is a message pointing towards unity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAbsolutely. That’s what house music’s origin was all about being inclusive and everyone being together. So who are some of these people you have looked up to all the time?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChad: When I was a rave bunny - I was listening to the old-school Josh Wink, Carl Cox, Sasha, Digweed, you know, the deep European progressive guys. and then there was a big trance movement when guys like Tiesto, Armand Van Helden, and Armin Van Buuren and the Dutch superstar was born. Dave and I religiously listened to trance around the world at that point, probably 10 or 11 years ago. The OceanLab Project was still a thing at the time, and we connected with Anjunabeats the most in terms of emotions. We did that record shopping thing for a while, but going back to when you are making a lot of music, you are sending A\u0026amp;R a ton of different things, and they just tried to cherry pick on top. So we had multiple labels pissed at each other, so we decided to start our own team, our own brand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDavid: Right. Those were definitely good ones. I’m a little younger too, so I came up with Tiesto and Armin, and even some non-EDM acts like Coldplay and the sound design of Pink Floyd. I really like the oddity of it, and I’m kind of all over the map right now, but these different influences all kind of come hand in hand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChad: Definitely. We still listen to really eclectic music now. We don’t really listen to the music we make now. We have this other side that people don’t really know about. Specifically, we love listening to Jon Hopkins, and anything piano-based, weird sound designs, deep progressive trance stuff, and chill, cinematic orchestra. So we’re going to figure that out. Maybe it’ll be another project that we’ll make. For instance, the first album we had a track called “Only Mortals”, which was a pointer towards Hopkins. This album has two or three, one of them is called “Sapphire” … which are way different and way far away from “Out My Mind”. But we are humans, and humans can have multiple interests, so who cares.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eThat’s for sure, many people have different stage names too.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChad: Yeah, and I think we should do that. Tritonal is so prolific and it has such momentum with what that needs to do, like sure you can have outliers, but we don’t want to just do an entire album Jon Hopkin style. I used to not think that, but I do now. There should be consistency within lanes. You could jump around a little here and there, but there needs to be a medium. When we make a future bass track, it’s usually a little sexy and emotional, very much the same way as “Now or Never” and progressive house tracks. So even if we do different rhythm sets, tempos, the melodic structure and chord progressions and types of melodies, whether it is broken-beaten at 140 or 128 on the floor. Fans may not see it that way, but that’s how I see it as a person who writes them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSpeaking of your label, how do you manage your time between that and touring?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChad: Will, as well as our managers Ahmed and Joe try to offset as much as they can. Ultimately, there is no right answer for that. I have twin boys who are 18-months, and a 3-year-old daughter, and David a 2.5-year-old son. When I go home on Sunday they’ll tackle me and I have to be ready for that. But we do know one way that doesn’t help is if you’re drinking, eating bad food, not having a spiritual discipline whether that’s meditation, yoga, exercise, and you’re just living in chaos. I love working out, I meditate, I don’t drink ever; he doesn’t drink when he is on the road. We love doing this, it’s creative and it’s fun, but it’s a business too. We do treat this as a career.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDave: We get up every single day and this is what we do, this is what we love. And we will cater to that. If you’re drinking or doing drugs, they’re getting in the way. It gets in your way when you have three little ones at home who If you are single, and that’s how you want to roll, then do your thing. No judgment, for real.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWas just about to ask what advice would you have for college students?  \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDave: THAT. And I was one in college. If you really want to do anything great in life, it takes a certain amount of discipline and focus. Even if you’re good. The best people you will find are disciplined. The great always are. They’re good, they have natural talent, but they couple it with consistency. And what we’ve done is consistently putting out music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAlright. So that’s the mantra of the year, thank you so much for your time. \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "The God Himself, Omar Apollo // Show Review",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003earticle by Adrian Tapia\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere were two lines: one for the smart people who reserved tickets and the other for the idiots waiting in standby. I was one of those idiots.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoth lines shared something in common though. The two were both eager and desperate to see the Indiana born and raised god himself, Omar Apollo.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI had only listened to Omar a couple of times, with most of them being with my die-hard fan girlfriend. I found his songs to be lovely in having the ability to get the listener in a very lustful mood. So, when I saw that he was going to be at UCLA, and FOR FREE, I knew I had to go. I just ended up waiting in a line with my fellow Bruins, unsure if we were going to get in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the reserved ticketholders all got in, taking all the good seats in the small Northwest Auditorium, us in standby practically ran in trying to get the seats closest to the sunken stage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlms was first to the stage. The 4-person band just walked on, announced themselves, and started playing. Right away the drummer took the lead. His quick and loud pounding took me in. He switched from rhythm to rhythm throughout individual songs. Changing his speed and aggression constantly. His drumming was different and not the same consistent repetitive drumming in songs that we have come to expect from those who play this instrument.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other members, however, did not take me in. The singer had this no fucks attitude when singing, sort of like Kurt Cobain. The guitarist and bassist played well, but there was nothing unique or different in their style strumming or play.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, was the band bad? No.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI did enjoy them actually. Alms’ mellow songs that slowly picked up speed and got louder were pleasant. It got me in a dancing mood. After their set was over, I pulled out my phone, looked them on Apple Music, the superior streaming service, and found that they weren’t there. So, then I went on Spotify, found them, and followed them. They have a new EP coming soon, so please check it out and support this band. You know I will.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter a short 15-minute intermission, the guitarist, bassist, and drummer of Omar’s band appeared on stage. They pick up their instruments and just started playing. Immediately, they started off with this synchronized hard, aggressive, fast-paced playing of their instruments that brought some fans to their feet. It hyped us up and got us instantly engaged. THEN HE RUSHED OUT. OMAR JUST RAN ON STAGE JUMPING AND SWERVING AND TURNING. Everyone just got up from their seats and started screaming. His stage presence was strong and filled with fun energy. He constantly encouraged the crowd to sing along and dance. He would talk to us between songs and respond to our “I LOVE YOU” comments. He told us stories, introduced us to parents, and brought forth Latinx pride. He wanted us to feel as if we were friends and I loved that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd this man can sing. Omar was able to reach falsetto with ease numerous times, turning on everyone in that auditorium. No struggling, no croaking, this man is a straight fucking god. His low, rich, and beautiful voice, that accompanied the slow beats was something I had never heard live before. And it’s something that not everyone can so easily replicate.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis band also deserves equal recognition too. They had this chemistry that made every song louder, more riveting, and straight sexy bro. The guitarist, who also doubled as the pianist, was an astonishing musician. I wished I hit the gardening club up before because he played these psychedelic guitar riffs that had me going.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI believe that Omar Apollo’s best attribute is his relationship with the audience. His dancing, moments of messing around, and engagement with the crowd make him an amazing, entertaining performer. Fans screamed for him to play his bass-heavy song “Heart” and Omar attempted to. He was going to alter his planned setlist just for the fans. But because of some technical difficulties, he couldn’t. But still, his attempt at it shows how much he loves and appreciates his fans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen in his final song, fans rushed the stage and jumped and danced with him. And you could see that he loved it. He enjoyed being with them in celebrating an amazing set with the people that love him. We love Omar Apollo and he loves us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWell, the heads of the show freaked and ended it right there. The lights were turned on and people were being pulled off, BUT HIS BAND KEPT GOING. THEY STRAIGHT KEPT PLAYING WITH BEING EVEN LOUNDER AND MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN BEFORE. God, I fucking love them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wasn’t able to stay for the post-show meet-and-greet with Omar, but from what I heard, it was wholesome. He hugged and smiled at and with every single fan that approached him. He truly does care, and it is not a gimmick he pulls. He genuinely loves us.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Interview with SpaceGodApollo (11/2/18)",
    "content": "\u003ch2\u003eInterview occurred on “No Pulp Radio Show” with DJ Odyssey, Ishaan Pota and Lily Frankel\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eThis interview has been edited and transcribed for concision with some questions edited for clarity by Lily Frankel\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJO: So for those who don’t know you are, like where are you from?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSGA: Oh shit, alright, so I was born in Houston. And then honestly my childhood roots were all based in Pasadena, my grandparents, and like my sister and shit. And then, uh, shit, after that, that’s when I started living with my dad, uh, in Missouri City. And uh, yeah, shit was kind of rough in the beginning though, cause when my parents got a divorce, I didn’t see my dad for like, four years. So I was with my grandparents and like shit was always rough over there cuz like my family, like, they kind of fucked up. And there’s some shit I had to go through and I had to see and it fucking sucks, but if I didn’t go through that shit I wouldn’t be where I am today, representing my grandparents the way I am today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJO: Would you say music is kind of like an escape for you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSGA: Definitely, man. I think music, for anyone that’s like depressed out there and they don’t have an outlet where they can seek help, it’s like, music is something that can be personal to them, and only them. And they can carry that with them for life. And it’s like, there’s artists that have affected me, that are going to affect me for life. And I’m always going to be so grateful that\u0026hellip; God put them along my path, because it truly did help me and guide me as a person.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJO: So when did you decide that being an artist is what you wanted to do as a career?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSGA: Damn, man. I remember when I was like 11, 12, I started DJing, and I wanted to make like dubstep because skrillex was hype. And I made like a badass, like, remix of Ellie Goulding, her cover of “High for This” by the weekend. That shit was fire, bruh [laughs]. And I was like 12. And I actually got it up on youtube right now, to this day, but uh, shit after that I was like uh, no, what am I doing, I’m young as hell [laughs], like I’m trippin’ thinking I’m finna be some kind of DJ. And then uh, I started getting really into RNB Music, and I really really started getting into like, just vocalists in general, that shit, it just amazed me how some people’s voices could be so powerful that it can affect millions and millions of people. And that shit really inspired me and it made me want to do something in my life that would benefit, like, more than I could ever imagine. And It was probably around like eighth grade, freshman year that I was like, yo, like, I want to be involved in music. I’m not sure how yet? But I’m going to start trying. And I spent a good ten to like, twelve months, just writing every single day song, song, song after song. I missed days of school cause I kept getting in trouble just sitting on my phone with earbuds, like writing lyrics because I was fucking addicted. And uh, I’d miss school and like, literally the whole eight hours of school that’d be going on? I’d be in my room just going off writing and writing and writing perfecting my craft. Studying wordplay, rhyme schemes, all the cadences, everything. And eventually I was like, yo, like, I’d never sing in front of nobody but when I was young my sister used to get singing lessons? And so I would always, you know, that’s my sister, I looked up to her, I would want to hang out with her and see her do her shit. And uh [laughs] I actually learned a lot from it. I would go, like, my own private, when I’m in my room, like really young, I’m talking like five or six? And I would take what she would learn from her instructor and like apply it to myself, but in secret, for so many years. And uh, shit, that’s when I met Christian, freshman year, like first day of school, and like, we just became boys. He tells me he wants to be a photographer, I’m like bro, like, I kinda want to be like, some kind of artist, whether it be singing or rapping, I don’t know yet. And then he was like bet [laughing], I’ll be your photographer, let’s do it. And I was like\u0026hellip; It just naturally came together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJO: So my next question is, with the music scene so saturated with new up and coming artists, what do you do to separate yourself from everybody else?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSGA: Listen to all types of different music and find a way to respect it, and each its own. Like I will pull up, like, 40s, songs, from like, the war. And sad songs that were like, made to be sad, and try to understand what attracts people to sad songs. And it’s like, when it comes to me, I feel like every song I’ve put off out the jump has been extremely different from the other. And I feel like for me it’s all been, like, just how I’m feeling in the moment, how I’m feeling in my life. I take time dropping my tracks because I want to live different chapters of my life before I put out something that’s like, my baby, you know. That baby is developing while I’m developing as a person too. And it’s like, forever evolving. But then it’s also just like my sound is just like, forever evolving. I’ve got songs coming out like, if you want to find something that sounds like that, there’s only one place you can go. And it’s like, that’s what I’m trying to make the gold-standard for all my shit. Every song, I want it to be unique and where it’s one of a kind.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIshaan: Who are some artists today that you draw inspiration from?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSGA: Artists today I draw inspiration from, man. Alright, like, no particular order, but like: of course, Kendrick Lamar, King Kendrick pulls true to me and a lot of like where my\u0026hellip; my work ethic comes from, I see his wordplay and I’m like, man, this guy is a monster, he’s a freaking beast, he’s not from here [laughs]. Like, how can I compete with that. And I’m like, the only way I can compete with that is focusing on myself, keeping to myself and working fucking hard. But along with Kendrick Lamar, shit, I got, Future. Young Thug. Travis Scott of course. Shit, he went to, we went to the same school, uh, knew him way back, my sister was tight with him way back. And uh, one of the big things, also, about, you know, staying lengthy, is like, I could have been that person, you know, knowing his siblings and stuff, and been like, hey, please show Travis Scott my music, we went to the same high school, we’re friends, blah blah blah. But it’s like, I ain’t ever do that. I ain’t ever tell my parents about my music, I ain’t ever tell my sister about my music. I wanted this to be something that I accomplish on my own. And it would really make me feel complete in my life and everything and it’s something I love and want to do forever. And uh, Travis Scott definitely showed me that music can definitely be more than a hook and a verse. You know, he showed me the future and the way sounds are evolving, and you know, the way softwares and things like that, midis, are evolving, shit can get ridiculous [laughs] in the future. And it’s like, I just want to become one of the greatest artists of all time, that’s definitely the ultimate goal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLily: Do you think that, for you, that comes from lyrics?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSGA: For me? I think a lot of it—I feel like it’s all one big, not necessarily formula, but everything has to like, it has to fit, it has to make sense. It’s like, if I’m going to have a beat that sounds like it’s retro, it sounds like I’m taking you back to a different time, I’m going to rap in a way, or sing in a way, that’s from that time. I’m going to pay homage to that and respect it, and also put my own swagger to it and my own\u0026hellip; my own generational sound to it and really make it my own. And like I’ve done covers of songs by like, Billie Eilish, and I’ve like completely altered them and changed them and made them completely different.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJO: So you’re performing at Complex Con this year. How did that even go down? How did the booking go down, what are the details behind that if you can elaborate?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSGA: Yeah, basically, this past year, like, my dad, uh\u0026hellip; He had gone to a Jamba Juice and like, in the nearest town center, and he had heard my song playing in Jamba Juice. But he didn’t know it was me. But he liked the song. And so he had the workers, cause he goes there, he’s like a daily person, and so he had asked the workers, like, what song is this? I’ve never heard this on the radio. And they were like, oh, it’s this guy named Ricky Apollo, he graduated from Elkins recently—my school—and he’s like twenty-something, but he makes really cool music. And my dad was like, Ricky Apollo? And I’m sure he like was like, that voice sounds familiar, there was no autotune or nothing. And just so everyone knows, it was my song “Feel.” It was actually my second song I had ever written\u0026hellip; yeah, ever written, ever released, ever. And uh, thankfully, by like, the graciousness of God, XXXtentacion had found that song before everyone, and he had reposted it, and that’s when I got, like, my first little spark of exposure. [\u0026hellip;] So my dad had asked about how that song, where that song came from. And he calls me and he’s like [affects a slightly older, higher-pitched voice], “hey do you know, uh, who Ricky Apollo is?” he goes, “is that you?” And I’m like, “yeah.” And then he’s like, your song is\u0026hellip; you make music?” And I’m like, “yeah.” And he’s like, “it’s playing in Jamba Juice.” And I was like, “really? That’s cool.” And he was like, “what? Are you joking?” And I’m like, “nah.” [laughing] “I guess you had to find out sooner or later.” And then he immediately told my sister. And my sister freaked out because, you know, like I said, when she was younger she always wanted like, to sing, and she wanted to be a singer. And she’s a fucking incredible singer. And I’ll never be at her level [laughing], but uh, no yeah, her vocals are\u0026hellip; she’s blessed for real. Like she’s\u0026hellip; if you think my voice is good, it’s like\u0026hellip; her shit’s on steroids. Like she could do opera. But uh, so my sister found out about it and whatnot. And of course, she’s my sister and she loves me, and as much as I wanted to do it alone, she was like let me help you. I want to be a part of this, I want to do this together. Because I feel like [voice breaks]\u0026hellip; our whole life it’s like\u0026hellip; It’s really just been me and her\u0026hellip; And like\u0026hellip; for her to like, feel that way? And want to help? It means like, it means everything, you know. And so she, actually, her boyfriend is a DJ. And uh, he performed at Voodoo just last weekend. His name’s Swaylo. SwayloNights on Instagram, shoutout him. Shoutout my sister, Lizzie Aguirre. So they’re actually both managing me at the moment. So Noah, who is my sister’s boyfriend, the DJ, he has a friend who is the event coordinator at Complex. And so he was like, hey man, this kid’s got a lotta talent. And I want to help him so badly and I want to reach out to as many people as I can, is there anything you can do. And the guy was like, yeah, I’ll check it out and see what I can do. And he listened to it, he got back to him. He said, yo, this is crazy, I’m gonna let the higher-ups get a listen to it. And uh, play him, like these songs, that, you know, I had chosen that I wanted them to listen to? And uh, they had all loved it, and they were like, yo, we have an open slot, let’s fly him out here, let’s get him the hotel, let’s get him the whole package, let’s feed him. And I’m so grateful for that man, it’s crazy. I remember he was like I’m gonna get back to you in a week, I don’t know if it’s for certain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJO: Yo that must have been the longest week.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSGA: Oh my god, you have no idea man, I was like, I was hitting the sauna and the sweat room like every fuckin day, just trying to keep my cool, tryna stay relaxed, I was like, it was definitely going to be, I knew it was going to be the biggest moment for me, and I knew it could definitely jumpstart. literally. Everything. And there’s endless possibilities, but uh, yeah, that’s really how it all came together. And after that, it’s like, I’ve got Forbes in my email, because they’re like, dude, you’re young as hell, how did you get on this line-up, and it’s like, we wanna know more about you. And it’s like, they wanna talk too. And it’s gonna be after my performance, and I’m the first one? Starting the weekend? Of all of Complex Con? And, oh my god, am I so ready, to fucking set everyone’s mind ablaze, bro. I want everyone to be hype as fuck and get ready to fucking rage all weekend, get fucked up, and have an amazing time that you won’t remember.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan you walk us through your creative process?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSGA: Yeah, so, definitely, see when it comes down to my creative process, it’s like, okay, I’m driving a four hour drive from Austin to Houston, like whatever, like I’m bouncing around, and it’s like all of a sudden [snaps] shit just hits me, out of nowhere, a concept, and I’ll quickly take out my phone, open my notes, write a concept, it’s like, this is the type of song I want to put together. [\u0026hellip;] And then, uh, later I’ll go home and reflect on that, or maybe I’ll spend two months, like just living life, and then I’ll come back to that and be like damn, I really want to talk about that now. And then I’ll just go to writing, for hours on hours, days on days, and then when it finally comes down to a studio sesh, Imma get like five, six hours for that one song, and I’m gonna fully, uh, invest myself into making that song fucking incredible in the best way I can possibly make it. [\u0026hellip;] When I get like in the studio it’s really all about like, we’re all gonna be there, you know my engineer, Matthew O’Neil, he’s a huge part of the creative process. Me and him, we really, we have a like, unspoken chemistry that we just\u0026hellip; we don’t even need to talk about, it’s just laughable at this point. We bounce off of each other’s ideas like, like at the speed of light, it’s crazy. I’ll just be in the booth, I don’t have to exit for like eight hours, we just, we know what we’re talking about, we know what we want to do, and when it’s time to experiment, it’s like, I really let him show me, and like show me what we can do with pro tools and stuff like that. And I’ve taken the time to have studio sessions where I simply just learn about the plug-ins and like learn about shit I can try to experiment later, you know, and like sit on and think about. And I feel like that’s really important, I feel like a lot of people think they can just write a verse and a hook, go to a studio and record it and that’s it, but then it’s like, you realize you just made a very boring song, you know. And I feel like, my music, I try to have a different dynamic, a more exciting dynamic, it’s like, Imma keep the same core vibe the whole time, but I’m gonna keep you on your toes with what’s about to happen next, whether the beat’s gonna get chopped and screwed, fuckin Houston style, or like, shit, we’re gonna come in with a like a choir of like my voice, or I’m all of a sudden gonna hit a falsetto, that you have no idea I can even hit that range, and it’s like, it’s really, I really like surprising people and I feel like that’s why, all my releases, I’ve always released it like boom [snaps]. Surprise. Something completely different. And they’re like damn, like, people will be like, oh, make more RNB, make more—do something jazzy, do something trap. And I’m like alright, I’m gonna mesh it all together. I’m gonna get a jazz beat, I’m gonna sing it in RNB, but then my words are gonna be about the trap [laughter]. And then I’ll take that from like, real-life experience, like obviously my parents don’t know this but like I’ve been trappin for a minute. And like that’s how we gotta make a lot of shit happen. Because I can’t be working a 9-5 and think I’m gonna be fucking inspired to make some music that’s gonna touch people’s soul. I’m not gonna do that sitting behind a fucking counter, scanning barcodes. I’m gonna do that from being out, with my friends, experiencing life, experiencing adventures, taking trips and like, going, getting one-way tickets to fucking LA for Complex Con.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow do you stay centered? Because the life of an artist, it has so many ups and downs and unpredictabilities, what do you do to center yourself and just keep sane, and keep the team sane?\u003cbr/\u003eSGA: Shit, man. [laughs.] When it comes to keeping the team sane, you gotta be more insane than everyone else combined. You have to be able to deal with your own demons and your own negative thoughts extremely well, by yourself, in order to take care of other people, I feel like. I feel like—and that also transitions to relationships. It’s like, I can’t take care\u0026hellip; of another girl\u0026hellip; if I’m not right with myself. And it’s like, if I’m not good, and if I’m not in a good mental state, and I can’t even get myself in control, if my girl is hurting or she’s going through some shit, how can I be there for her if I can’t be there for myself. So I feel like a lot of keeping the team sane is really just like me keeping my composure when shit get crazy, and when shit get wild, when like, things go south, whatever, I really like, you gotta be a leader sometimes, you gotta be like a red power ranger. [DJO laughs.] Like you got the whole team, you got the whole team, but like, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta have some guidance in there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJO: Just turned nineteen, so for you to already kinda be encompassing this leadership quality, and just being like hey, I’m grounded, I’m centered, and you know, because, I understand the team kinda feeds off that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSGA: Honestly, it’s like, as much as it sucks, that like, cause like I fuckin, honestly, honest to God, like I fucking hate my childhood, but if it wasn’t for my childhood, and me and my sister just being, like, by ourselves, going through our shit, it really helped us mature a lot faster, and I feel like that’s why I didn’t fuck with a lot of people in high school, and even in middle school, because I just had, I’ve seen a whole fucked up world that these kids at the time hadn’t seen. And I was, like, different in the head, but like, you know, obviously, like, I wasn’t going to make a big deal about it, it was just, Ima just keep to myself and worry about myself and my fam and making sure my sister’s good, my momma’s good, my dad’s good, my friends are good. Everyone. You know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJO: If you feel comfortable sharing, like, what’s one of the most fucked up things you’ve seen. Or, the most fucked up thing you saw.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSGA: Shit. One of the most fucked up things I’ve seen, is\u0026hellip; my uncle, coming home, one day, uh, to my grandparents\u0026rsquo; crib, and like, I got other uncles there, at the time, and like, they\u0026hellip;. You know, they, they, they could be fiends back then and they would be fightin, over like crack, because one of them would be like selling crack or have crack and [takes a deep breath] they fuckin, they get fucked up, and then they fight each other over it and then my grandparents tried to get involved, get them out of it, and they’re like in their fucking late eighties, nineties, and, and then, my uncle, beat my grandmother\u0026hellip;. [voice breaks] and my grandfather, you know, like\u0026hellip;.. right in front of me, and it’s like\u0026hellip; when you’re that young, and [crying] you care about those people, that shit hits different. And that’s when I would, have to, realize I can’t do anything. And then uh\u0026hellip; I’ve never talked about this [laughs weakly]. [A moment of quiet. His friend rubs his shoulder.]\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJO: I mean, we could stop if it’s getting a little bit too deep, man.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSGA [his voice is quiet. He’s still crying. His friend is still rubbing his shoulder.]: Nah, it’s cool, it’s just\u0026hellip; it’s just hard to dig back. I try so hard to like\u0026hellip;. not think about it, but\u0026hellip; it’s tough. And like that uncle, he’s, you know, he’s rotting in jail [crying], and\u0026hellip; you know, he’s my uncle, but\u0026hellip; he’s made his choices, and so, you know? [Exhales.] He’s got to pay for that shit I guess, bro. Nonetheless, like\u0026hellip;. just gotta keep moving forward. Keep doing what we’re doing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eL: You talked about earlier, a little bit, meditation on the plane and spirituality, that kind of stuff, do you think that’s something that’s helped you and translated into your music at all?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSGA: Yeah, just like I’ve said, you know my sister, you know, she lived through the same fucked up shit, and so she’s actually a fuckin professional yogi, like, instructor. And she’s very spiritual and she found her own way to cope with what she goes through, through her lane, and I found mine, and I feel like we really help each other as a [voice breaks] family, and it’s\u0026hellip; and keep each other strong, and she really showed me how to [voice breaks] keep my sanity, and keep myself\u0026hellip; together, even though I have so many regrets\u0026hellip; growing up, but. [Takes a breath.] Yeah, on the plane I really just had to get in touch spiritually and realize that\u0026hellip; I’m doing this all for a greater purpose, personally. And it’s like\u0026hellip; I feel like the reason that I could give a fuck about fame or fortune is like why I try so hard. It’s cause like, it’s really, it’s really for everyone around me. [Crying.] And I got so much love for the people around me. Real talk. I’d kill—I’d kill for my people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDJO: So let’s get on a little bit lighter note, why don’t we talk about the track we just played for the people [“Hol’ Up”]? What was the process going behind that track? I remember when we were in the living room, we were talking about how it was one of your favorite tracks to develop.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSGA: One of my favorite tracks I’ve ever made, man. Uh, this producer, out in like\u0026hellip; uh, I think he’s Norwegian\u0026hellip; hit me up, like, didn’t even know English, like, talking through google translate, and he’s like, yo, I heard your shit, and like, it’s crazy. Check it—I do old school rap beats, I don’t know if you’ll like it, but fuck with it. And so I’m like, dude, I love old school rap, and I’ve always wanted to go down that lane, it’s just no producers right now, that I can get in touch with, are doing it well. And he sent me this beat and I knew, like, the way it had me moving? With no lyrics? I just knew, like, if I felt that way about it, I-I don’t have to write shit. Ima go in there and Ima go off my vibe and how I feel and when people hear it they’re gonna feel what I’m feeling and feel how I was in the booth. And when I had booked that session, me and Matt were like, let’s fuck around, let’s just re-spark the inspiration, let’s get back into, like, our hard-core work ethic, and we get like a 10-hour studio session, and we just\u0026hellip; get a couple beats, put them together, free-style for hours, and we had put together like a 16-minute long freestyle. And it’s like, between my closest friends—it was never released, but between my closest friends, they still tell me to this day, like, drop it. And I think, uh, it’ll be something that’ll go on Soundcloud like years from now, just as something to look back on. And uh, cause that was my way of just like furthering, learning more about myself and my voice, and trying to hit extremes, in a completely, like\u0026hellip; when you’re just high as hell, and a beat will literally move every fucking nerve in your body and it will just come so naturally. And so after I had literally done that for hours, like eight hours, and I’m like, damn, like, I’m tired as hell, let’s just chill bro, I’ve got this nice-ass old-school beat, let’s throw it on. And so Matt throws it on, immediately he’s like—he loves old school rap—and he was like, yo, like, this is fire, go get in that booth. And I was like bet, let’s get it. And then uh, we honestly knocked it out in probably like 25 minutes flat. Like, no autotune, ran through that shit. I had one thing written, and it was “hol’ up, wait, let me go out to your estate.” And we just \u0026hellip; ran that hoe. And that, I feel like that’s why it was so amazing to me, cause I thought like, I was so exhausted and like done for the day, nothing would come out, and it’s like—I had made the best song to me that I had ever—it was the most rewarding song to me, honestly. I feel like it was just: the ad-libs were perfect, my melodies were perfect, the vibe was perfect, and to me—it made me happy. And if it’s like, it makes me happy? I know if I can get the exposure, and get it out to millions of people, a good portion of them will like it too. And that’s all I need, to like, you know, want to keep going.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eListen to the full interview \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/space_odyssey/spacegodapollo-interview-wdj_odyssey\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e and check out “Hol’ Up” and other SpaceGodApollo tracks on \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/spacegodapollo/hol-up\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSoundcloud\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/2Wf7rwfZon4FfSgAZfaXSA?si=OCsdAMheSmuPm59YLAZdNg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSpotify\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eInterview and photographs by Princess Amugo\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"1920\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/86ea879f228bf98d3b39b729151049af/tumblr_inline_pl1s0iP8zZ1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"1920\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eNYALLAH (she/they pronouns) is a literal gem, beaming her way through the art world, and the world in general, with her essence, personality, talent, and energy. Nyallah is a multidisciplinary artist (vocalist, songwriter, photographer, creative curator) from LA who currently studies music at USC whom I had the pleasure to interview early December last year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this interview, we first discuss her new single “Growing Pains” that was officially released on November 9th, 2018 (which is apart of a larger work named \u003ci\u003eReflections\u003c/i\u003e that will be out on 1/11/19). “Growing Pains” is a neo-soul R\u0026amp;B song that perfectly encapsulates the advice that is needed when one may be situated at a threshold where the pathways of moving forward, moving backward, and not moving at all meet. Nyallah discusses how she wrote this song at a time when major challenging shifts in her life were taking place. She was going through a period in which she felt isolated and lost, the future seemed to take shape as a looming fog that was unclear and unfamiliar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt this site, that many of us have had the distasteful pleasure of experiencing, she was demanded to be real with herself and decide whether or not she was going to “hold on to the past”. These are moments that call forth hard choices that invite vulnerability with ourselves and most importantly growth. “Growing Pains” acts as an upbeat reassurance and validation that recognizes the confusion and hurt one is going through at this point but instead of repressing these feelings, the lyrics welcome these growing pains, affirming that we will be met with some transformative healing. Therefore, “Growing Pains” takes the big, scary monster growth (a companion to drastic change) that we all have shut our eyes or looked away in fear from and shrinks it into something that no longer has fangs and claws but rather it is something that we all must face if we want to evolve mentally, emotionally etc as human beings. She addresses this monster, growth, which helps in beginning the ongoing journey of tending to the aching of limbs and tendons caused by it. With this song, Nyallah opens up the dialogue of being more compassionate with ourselves by forgiving our past mistakes in order to move forward and close older chapters. She encourages taking a new path so that we can take the time to self-reflect and self-assess. It creates the space to be able to unpack whatever tough moment you had experienced in order to make more space to grow into ourselves. So essentially, this song is everything you need and more especially with this new year coming in, a time where many of us are hyper-fixated on what we can improve on or change about ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"1920\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/266a2dc95f5b3efc55accf2c8aab3858/tumblr_inline_pl1s6i5gsv1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1080\" data-orig-height=\"1920\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWithin the latter of the interview, we truly get into IT and discussed how the song “Growing Pains” has grown with her and has even changed its meaning a bit when applied to her own life. We delved into how she has learned to be unapologetic when it comes to being a black queer femme in a racist-white-homophobic-patriarchal-capitalistic society that was built to break her down. We talk about how she navigates the world with her learned mindset that derived from the process of growing that has helped her to break free from feeling forced to appeal to the white gaze, male gaze and more. She shares her experiences of being in a music program at a PWI that actively undervalues her work and the work of other black artists while praising white artists for putting out work that is mediocre and/or a copy from a black artist (this, of course, we see in not only PWI spaces but everywhere writ large with the distinctions of “low art” and “high art” that is inherently a white racist dichotomy). This is just to name a few of the topics that she delved into.\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/dj-freeze-5/nyallahs-interview-1\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e Listen to the interview\u003c/a\u003e to get the full experience of what conversations came about talking about music and art in general!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBe on a lookout for Nyallah’s EP \u003ci\u003eReflections\u003c/i\u003e which and also other projects that she is working on that may be outside of music or working in tandem with it such as curating art shows.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFollow her social media to stay updated: IG (\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/n.yallah/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e@n.yallah\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "Westerman @ the Moroccan Lounge (11/28/2018) // Show Review",
    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003earticle by Salvatore Ingrassia \u0026amp; photos by Matthew Schulze\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3888\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/d378563624da7245963787a3196a661e/tumblr_inline_pjjmfahTC81qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3888\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs my buddies and I pulled up to the Moroccan Lounge around 7:30, it immediately became apparent that we had committed two rookie mistakes: failing to dress for the weather and actually showing up on time. With some time to kill and rain to avoid, we settled at the bar and ordered a few drinks.  A quick survey of the place suggested that the Moroccan Lounge is a far cry from the archetypal LA club. The walls were decorated to look like some sort of bohemian speakeasy, and in place of the typical barrage of cologne and dime-a-dozen house playlists was a more laid-back atmosphere tailored to the venue’s late-twenties indie demographic. After 45 minutes or so we went into the stage room to see the first opener.\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3888\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5fc18c4401fb0cad7fd5c366e14c744a/tumblr_inline_pjjmfonteI1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3888\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo be frank, I don’t think many in the crowd knew who either of the openers was, except for a select few who were clearly friends of the bands.  This was to be expected though, as the Moroccan Lounge is a small venue and the night’s headliner isn’t exactly a household name.  However, both acts put on surprisingly animated and engaging shows.  The first opener was Colin Caulfield, whose entire set-up consisted of a laptop and a succulent sitting atop a cloth-draped podium–needless to say, this dude didn’t take himself too seriously. In between his dancy, smooth pop tracks Caulfield would nonchalantly banter with the audience about his songs being unfinished, his recent tour of Indonesia, and how everyone needs someone to call them out on their bullshit. That said, his performance was genuinely fantastic. His vocal delivery was recording-quality and his dance moves–which can best be described as flamboyant swimming–added to the tongue-in-cheek vibe of his set.  After he wrapped up, we headed inside for a few more drinks until Boy Willows came out. To my surprise, this was by far the most energetic performance of the night.  Willows and his backing band jammed over what sounded like a funky mix of Phoenix, Glass Animals, and alt-J in front of incredibly psychedelic visuals.  They performed with the confidence and swagger of an act ten times their stature, and I found myself getting frustrated that the crowd wasn’t getting as lit as the performance deserved.  The set ended with a sax solo out of the blue and with that, the crowd retreated once more to the bar until Westerman’s set.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3888\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/96c3fde774757029623f35ef94d967ec/tumblr_inline_pjjmg11yn81qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3888\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://blog.uclaradio.com/post/180998798312/interview-with-westerman\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBy his own admission\u003c/a\u003e, Will Westerman’s music doesn’t neatly fit into any one genre. This is in part due to the wide array of sounds the Londoner has experimented with across his small discography.  Since debuting the folky Harvard EP in 2016, Will has spent the better part of two years becoming acquainted with the recording process. In doing so, he’s broadened his sonic palette immensely. This transition first became apparent on 2017’s Call and Response EP, which featured much more varied and atmospheric instrumentation. By 2018, Will had all but abandoned his acoustic roots in favor of more experimental sound.  This year’s singles and the Ark EP are markedly more electronic and atmospheric than Will’s previous output, a move I find well-suited to his melody-driven songwriting. However, throughout this evolution Will’s music has maintained its defining subtlety. As a fan of all iterations of Westerman, I was thoroughly bummed when I heard his set beginning while I was in the bathroom.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3888\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/7f5e80c90502051affba01ebb945223c/tumblr_inline_pjjmhiY2jo1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3888\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eI finally made it back into the crowd about halfway through the opening song. The vibe of Westerman’s set was starkly different from those of the previous acts.  For one, his setup was far more modest–it was just him, a bassist, and a keyboardist with no backing visuals or light displays. His stage presence was likewise more subdued, although I wouldn’t say that that was necessarily a bad thing. Will’s music is much headier than it is lively and his performance was successful in delivering compelling renditions of his studio work. Despite the modest setup, each song sounded incredibly full. I found that much of Will’s music really benefited from the live instrumentation–the guitarwork felt a little more organic, the drum machines hit heavier, and the synth swells became far more consuming. The more layered songs like “Albatross,” “Roads,” and “Outside Sublime” felt much grander live. Meanwhile, Will’s acoustic songs translated quite nicely into this electronic setup and contributed to the performances’ chill, atmospheric, “vibey” vibe.  The set ended with a fun, albeit predictable, encore of my favorite Westerman song “Confirmation.” Overall, the show sounded incredible and despite the modest staging, I left satisfied with experience as a whole. The dude just needs to hurry up and release an LP.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3888\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/2337185cbbbf4e1e58c679ed4a7d880b/tumblr_inline_pjjnbkq5Di1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5184\" data-orig-height=\"3888\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

Not only does the party now have the capability to actively resist the Trump administration’s heinous method of governance, but it also needs to start preparing for the future. \u003ci\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe top three Democrats in the House\u0026ndash;Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Jim Clyburn (D-SC), and Steny Hoyer (D-MD)\u0026ndash;do not represent the future of the Democratic party. Pelosi and Clyburn are both 78 and Hoyer is 79. While they are all strong, historic, and important members for the left, they also epitomize the antiquity of the party and its hesitance to transform into a more progressive political force. Although they were all elected by their constituents, the midterm election was essentially a mandate for Democrats to move further left, with Representatives-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) being some of the most prominent and progressive candidates to win their seats. In the current political climate, it is essential for older Democrats to vacate their seats and begin training their replacements. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Republican party is older, out of touch with younger generations, and subscribes to an outdated form of politics. Currently, though, Democrats aren’t much better. As recently as the 2016 election we saw evidence of the Democratic National Committee actively suppressing Bernie Sanders (the more progressive candidate) in favor of Hillary Clinton (the established, moderate candidate) despite substantial party support, especially among younger voters. Being the incoming voter base and the future leaders of the party, it is the responsibility of the party establishment to step aside and contribute their influence in a more effective way. A prime example is former California Senator Barbara Boxer retiring in 2017, giving way to Senator Kamala Harris, one of the most passionate and outspoken Democrats in Congress. Going forward we need Harris’s energy and passion, but we also need her youth and her appeal to progressive voters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough the calls for powerful female Democrats like Pelosi and Feinstein to step aside are sometimes combined with misogyny, it is still necessary for them and their male colleagues to find a replacement with a longer career ahead of them. The DNC must realize that their hesitance to change what has worked before is already hurting their presidential and congressional efforts in races 10 years away. The DNC and establishment legislators at all levels need to find the Ocasio-Cortezes, the Omars, and the Pressleys, and they need to give them the training and resources they need to develop themselves. Simply put, the new Democratic majority in the House shouldn’t comfort Democrats, it should energize us. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eAnna Kondratyeva interviews Jess from Crate Digging\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eFirst of all, what IS crate digging?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eCrate digging is basically going to record stores and you’re just like\u0026hellip;digging through these milk crates and just trying to find records, either ones that seem obscure or ones that you’re just trying to use for sampling, making beats, or just albums or tracks that you’re looking to put in a DJ mix. For the hip-hop genre, it was a lot more focused on creating beats, so like breaks and loops and actually producing music, while for DJs it was more like “okay, I need to find something to play tonight so I’m going to go to a record store and look through some crates, and the vinyl that I find are gonna be what I play tonight.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eSo what started your fascination with sampling? I feel like as far as radio show ideas go, this is pretty niche.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was always interested in electronic music in general, and so when I found out that the producers I really liked, like Daft Punk, were playing music that wasn’t originally theirs, and that most of their tracks were just samples from songs that came out in like the 70s, it was really surprising to me. I wanted to find out how many artists I loved did that\u0026mdash; how are they able to use this track and barely alter it at all. The cool thing about sampling is that a genre like rock can turn into hip-hop which can then be sampled and turned into electronic music, and through that process, you’re just adding more layers to it. You can basically trace the history of three different genres just by looking closely at a song that uses sampling, and to me, that’s really fascinating.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eDo you think there are any ethical issues with sampling? I just heard recently that Kanye was sued for his use of other artists’ songs in his music.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think sampling becomes a problem once you’re not giving recognition to the original song, and you’re doing it in kind of a sly way, where you just want to take someone else’s music and not give credit. But also, people say about artists like Kanye “oh, he doesn’t play any musical instruments, he can’t be all that talented, can he?” But in my opinion, you have to really have a good ear to know how to layer different genres of music, and the skill of having that musical knowledge to pull from is just as “full of talent “as actually playing an instrument.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eThat’s really interesting! I was really conflicted about this issue before we spoke, but when you explain it, it really does make sense. Continuing on, how do you find the music that you feature on your show?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOkay, well I have two segments of the show. One of them is “Guess that Sample,” where I play an original song until the audience can have that moment of “oh! I’ve heard this before,” and guess the contemporary song that sampled it. The second portion of the show is the crate digging portion, where I play songs from stuff I’ve found at record stores, or that a friend showed me, or even from Discover Weekly on Spotify, just in general any songs that I’ve found that I thought were hidden gems. These are songs that I feel like I would sample if I was a DJ or a producer\u0026mdash;all these obscure tracks that I love.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eMaybe you should be a DJ!\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI actually bought a controller a few months ago to learn how to DJ and I’m okay at it, I’m not bad, but I still have a long ways to go in terms of actually learning how to make sound.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eOkay, so tune in in a couple months to hear Jess become a DJ.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eYeah!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eYou’ve haven’t had your show for that long, but how do you feel like it’s evolved since you first started it\u0026ndash; when it was just an idea?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eYeah, I’ve always been interested in sampling and finding eclectic sources of music, but recently my episodes have just been about focusing on a single genre. For example, two weeks ago my show was just on hip-hop, and I just focused on how artists have taken genres like jazz and funk and repurposed them into hip-hop beats. I don’t know, maybe next quarter I just want to do crate digging on a single genre of music. I want to be able to really get into musical history and look at the sources and really trace the lineage of a single style, or a single sub-genre, or a single practice. Like I could focus on like turntable-ism, and how DJs were sampling and playing all these different vinyl at once because they were scratching and mixing them together. So sometimes I feel like getting more niche I guess, and more narrow, but then at the same time just having a general show just called “Crate Digging” gives me the freedom to play whatever I want to play.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eYou don’t want to feel limited.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eYeah, I’ve been constantly toying with the idea of whether to go more narrow or more broad, but for now I decided that that Crate Digging should really mirror being in a record store\u0026mdash;you can go to one section and browse that, or you can just bounce around and try to crate dig anywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eI feel like people don’t really do that anymore! I mean, going to record stores and just browsing for tracks is pretty rare nowadays.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’ve been trying to really stop myself from relying solely on music streaming services to find new music because I feel like it really stops me from listening to an entire album from start to finish. When I go to record stores and I see an album that I recognize as something that I want to get, I know that I will listen to the entire thing, I will read the liner notes, I will look at the artwork, I’ll hold it. And I won’t forget about it, because it’s there, it’s physically there! So I feel like I’ve been trying to resort to those practices.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eThat’s something we really lose out on now, I think.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I was a kid I had so many CDs! I had vinyl, cassettes, everything. I knew those albums like the back of my hand. So I hate that I now have more musical knowledge but at the same time, it’s also more shallow because I only listen to a few tracks from a bunch of artists. Now, when finding music it’s usually like “well, these are the artist’s top 5 songs so I guess I’ll just listen to these.” In a way, that really takes away from the artists’ creative concept for an album, because you’re just plucking one track from the story they’re trying to tell. You’re not thinking about the artist who made the artwork or about the other extra little details in an album. Crate digging forces me to do all of that, to look for music in an organic way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eIn a way, artists also realize that’s been devalued, so in a sense, it almost seems like why bother making a full-length album, why bother telling a story if people aren’t going to listen to all of it.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eYeah, exactly! What’s up with that trend with artists releasing albums that are like, 20 minutes long? I miss the time when you could get a full hour and 15 minutes of an album, and it was this long-awaited thing\u0026mdash;like, I will wait if it means quality music! But if listeners don’t really care about that stuff, then there’s no incentive for artists or producers to really care either, which kind of puts a consumerist spin on the whole thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eYou mentioned hip-hop and electronic music, but do you think there are any other genres that crate digging could potentially apply to?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOkay, honestly I feel like crate digging should apply to every genre, but I think the practice of crate digging is what develops your taste, because by looking for music and seeing what you like, and trying out different albums and pulling from them, obscure sources and whatnot, instead of just blindly accepting music, is what every artists and musician should do to create their own unique taste. That’s one of the most important things that any artist can have. Historically, hip-hop and electronic music have been at the forefront of using technology, taking songs apart, cutting and pasting tracks,\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eThat’s interesting because you can argue that that’s where music is going, that all genres are going to be extremely influenced by technology in the future.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI even think that because of how much technology we have, it makes genres themselves seem so arbitrary because musicians now are not limited to the instruments they play and can take use material from any genre and place it into what they are creating. All these genre lines become so blurred.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eTo wrap things up, do you have any advice for people that are trying to start their own show?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eStart it from a place of passion! Don’t start a show unless it’s from a theme or topic that you’re really deeply caring about. Because having listeners and having support is great, it’s really really nice, but that comes from you just starting from a place of passion for your show. School gets stressful and life gets crazy, but if you love the music you’re playing and you want to share it with other people, it’s never a burden. So yeah! Pick music that you really love.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eLastly, if you were a cactus, what kind of cactus would you be?\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m thinking of like the big round ones that are like big pillow looking things\u0026hellip;\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cb\u003eI’m looking at cacti images right now, and I believe you’re thinking of a golden barrel cactus.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s me! Is it low to the ground? I don’t like heights, and I’m very grounded with earth, so definitely not a person who likes being up high.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThat wraps up our interview! Tune in to Uclaradio.com at 11am every Thursday if you want to hear Jess talk more about sampling, cool record store finds, and the history of songs you never knew had a history.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

In that crowd full of glitter, rainbow and the best people, I felt safe and valid, despite the fact that 2016 ended up being an absolutely horrifying year for many marginalized communities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFast forward to 2018, Troye Sivan has transformed from being an emerging teenage alternative artist to a global pop sensation. For his long-time fans, his new album \u003ci\u003eBloom\u003c/i\u003e along with the singles such as “My My My!”, “Bloom” and “Dance To This” from earlier in the year are all surprisingly pop-oriented, and I was definitely among the worried group of fans. Based on my understanding of Troye Sivan’s musical style, it was really hard to imagine how he could possibly succeed in the current climate of pop. In addition, I had a fear that he had only chosen to opt for this mainstream genre simply because of the frenzy of pop rush within the young queer community that has emerged in recent years. His first album, \u003ci\u003eBlue Neighbourhood\u003c/i\u003e, has such an important place in my heart and I would hate to once again lose a favorite artist to the meaningless chase of pop and fame.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Well, The Bloom Tour has proven me wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009Stepping off my ride, I saw several lines of young people wrapping around the Greek Theatre. “I like your jacket,” a boy with glitter makeup on his face said to me. Immediately I snapped back to 2016, a different time when I was still so afraid to express myself through styling my outfit. Yet everything felt so familiar, that this crowd of young queer people was still so kind and encouraging\u0026ndash;just like how they were two years ago. Perhaps I expected a slightly different crowd, since Troye Sivan has completely switched up his musical genre and even his overarching style as an artist; instead, I was once again welcomed by the same loving energy but now from a slightly younger group of “lovely queer babies” (p.s. this is not to belittle any young queer people, I learned the phrase from a queer fashion show earlier this year referring to teenagers who had just came to terms their sexualities and it seems fitting to be used here).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5472\" data-orig-height=\"3648\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/640830e9c895f4cfd821c38677eebe22/tumblr_inline_pht0a64Kx91qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5472\" data-orig-height=\"3648\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eComforting. That’s how every Troye Sivan show feels like for both the artists and the audience. As the stage was being set up, people in the pit were already cheering for Carlie Hanson to come on as the first performer of the night. Only 18 years old, Carlie had already exceeded the expectations of many critics in the industry with her breakout synth-pop tracks such as “Only One” and “Mood”. Opening for a Greek Theatre show must be incredibly nerve-wracking for any teenage rising sensations, but Carlie’s performance was nothing but energetic and vibrant. As she struck up the stage, Carlie kept stepping over the speakers, running across the stage and leaning over to interact with fans from both sides\u0026ndash;all without even skipping one beat. With zero shyness or hesitation, she kept her genuine smile and confident attitude from the start of her set all the way till she left the stage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5472\" data-orig-height=\"3648\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/add643db6ae1e91d3810faa2241add0f/tumblr_inline_pht0bpGywl1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5472\" data-orig-height=\"3648\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eKim Petras’ performance was definitely just as powerful as Carlie. Drenched in a bloody suit, Kim and her DJ walked out from the smokescreen. Performing her culty, mysterious \u003ci\u003eHalloween EP\u003c/i\u003e and some of her classic pop tracks, the Greek turned into a giant party for the queer kids. Both Kim and Carlie’s interactions with the crowd were genuine and warming, despite the fact that most people came in to hear Troye. Supportive and loving, I was once again amazed by this young crowd of LGBTQ+ people. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5269\" data-orig-height=\"3513\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/0351b89ed6ac73ec360d73fc6998c2d3/tumblr_inline_pht0ezSjP91qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5269\" data-orig-height=\"3513\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy the time Troye got on stage, the show had officially sold out. As the lights went out, the theatre felt into a short second of silence before it was completely submerged by waves of screams. There he was, the pop prince of the gay community, dressed in his floaty, silk-like gown, walked out from the curtain. Accompanied by the calming intro of “Seventeen” and the dramatic spotlight shining upon him, Troye looked determined yet soothing. As the pre-chorus chimed in he headed toward backstage again, only to show up again standing on top of the twenty-feet tall platform when the first note of chorus dropped in the most dramatic way ever. Within just a few minutes, he had successfully proven to everybody inside the theatre that he is perfectly capable of illustrating his most original narrative through pop, that he had only bloomed to be better than ever.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0009My favorite part of any Troye Sivan show is still, the people. The supportive energy I had experienced from the two shows from both 2016 and 2018 has been unimaginable for both closeted me and the 19 years old me. Everyone was encouraged to be themselves, by some of the most hardworking and passionate young artists in today’s industry. Pop or alternative, it is important for all queer people to remember that as long as you stay true to yourself, the future can only get brighter from here\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5140\" data-orig-height=\"3427\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/e00699a64b9e55ef1d1d150e6a7edd8c/tumblr_inline_pht0ipaYDY1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5140\" data-orig-height=\"3427\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eFind more photography @gomi_show socials\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

All the way across the city of Los Angeles, 10am on a Saturday night, my friend and I were ready for a chill, intimate indie show. Needless to say, our prior understanding of Madeline Kenney was very bare minimum. We’ve both enjoyed her newest record, \u003ci\u003ePerfect Shapes\u003c/i\u003e. In addition, as a certified “Tumblr looking hoe” who actually never understood Tumblr, I love Madeline’s general branding. Although I’m more of a Panic! At The Disco type of angsty teen, I was ready to get angsty to some calm and collective vibes for this night.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5472\" data-orig-height=\"3648\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/cd1b3159384977dec2d13ffb56c0c2e7/tumblr_inline_ph618cfDM31qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5472\" data-orig-height=\"3648\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe arrived just a bit before 10 and sat in the bar area for a while. There were already a handful of people, chatting around and waiting for the show to officially start. The opener, Rose Droll, was casually walking around and mingling within the crowd. She was wearing mostly black, blending in perfectly well with everyone else; though, as what my friend had pointed out (“Oh I LOVE her shoes!”), her artisan-looking shoes and confident-yet-casual smile were enough to tell us that she was the second most important person for the night.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe opening set was exactly what we expected. When Madeline was promoting the show on her Instagram earlier in the day, she was saying that Rose had “already broke (her) heart during soundtrack”\u0026ndash;sure enough, Rose had a hauntingly beautiful voice. Whenever she shifted her attention away from her guitar to her drinks in between songs, the audience remained dead silent, as a way of respect for her almost-sacred, careful and vulnerable musical narration. In addition to her music, Rose’s charismatic sarcasm about herself, her parents and other things in general surely won the heart of everyone in the crowd. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5472\" data-orig-height=\"3648\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5a7aff45769216e6c1bd04c6ddd4f435/tumblr_inline_ph61ajnXC21qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5472\" data-orig-height=\"3648\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter Rose Droll’s set, Madeline and her band walked out casually and started to set up everything for themselves. Shortly after, she appeared once again with a daisy pattern romper and her neat short hair tied in two buns. Together with the band, they started playing the first number from the newest record, “Overheard”. My friend and I immediately noticed the difference between this live version and the studio version: this is now a single from a rock band instead of your plain-and-simple bedroom pop. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerhaps it was just the drummer, who seemed to be literally devoting all her energy into making sure every single beat would come out clear but heavy; but I doubt that was the case since the guitarist and Madeline also collaborated into the performative, daunting approach to the songs. Odd enough, even though the drumming was incredible and at times, overwhelmingly incredible, Madeline’s voice was still peaking through on top of the different layers of instruments and pre-recorded beats. To be honest, it was a strange scene to be in for me. The fact that none of the beats and rhythms was actually being modified, yet I was still experiencing something completely different\u0026ndash;simply because of the different orders in instrumental layering\u0026ndash;was both surprising and fascinating.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5356\" data-orig-height=\"3571\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/f0fe552444e7b115c90d88455e5b866d/tumblr_inline_ph61c5pWLL1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5356\" data-orig-height=\"3571\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThroughout the show, Madeline also had to take care of the sound level, pre-recorded samples, and various different instruments. Not only was she constantly turning multiple knobs on her keyboard, but she was also using her left foot to control several different channels (excuse me for not knowing more about production, I know my description here is awfully plain, I know). By the time we reached the halfway point of the show, Madeline had kicked off one of her shoes in order to have full control of all her samples on different channels. Perhaps this is usually not the norm for a headliner, but Madeline had definitely gained the audience’s respects for being able to have a full understanding of her own music and being able to have perfect control of it. As a performer, she is not just talented and skillful, but also patient and collective. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNo one helped the performers to clean up the stage afterward, Madeline and her companions took care of everything. After packing up, Madeline stepped out and proceeded to talk to everyone who was waiting for her\u0026ndash;despite the fact that it was almost midnight in the slightly sketchy LA Art District area. “Thank you for coming, hope to see you next time!” Madeline smiled as we said goodbye to her. As we stepped out of the venue, I promised myself to attend another one of Madeline’s show soon. This young woman and her team were incredibly inspiring with their independence, confidence, and passion, and I would definitely love to cross paths with them in the future again. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5311\" data-orig-height=\"3541\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/37814fec238258dfabb42c5b906cf3da/tumblr_inline_ph61e1BwEN1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5311\" data-orig-height=\"3541\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003earticle by Alysun Littlefield\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn February 7th, the US State Department released a six-month review of the policy that Trump has dubbed “Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance.” The name might be different, but we know this policy well; originally dubbed the “Mexico City Policy” by Reagan in 1984, it is now more widely known by feminists and women’s rights advocates as the global gag rule.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo what does this policy do? While the US already banned foreign aid from being used for abortion services in 1973 (which is insane in and of itself), the global gag rule takes this further and says that any NGOs that use their own, non-US funds for providing abortion access will have their aid cut off. As the United States is the largest development aid funding country in the world, cutting off this kind of assistance can have significant impacts. These NGOs must certify they none of their funding goes to:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eProviding abortion services\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCounseling patients about the option of abortion or providing referrals for abortions\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTraining abortion providers\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdvocating for the liberalization of abortion laws\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eMultiple studies show that this policy does not reduce the overall abortion rates, but instead just the number of \u003ci\u003eunsafe\u003c/i\u003e abortions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrump’s reinstatement of this law is not surprising. Since it’s first conception, every Democrat that’s been elected has repealed it and every Republican has reinstated it, which is a huge problem for NGOs working on these issues because changing US politics can hinder any kind of growth they achieve and make long term projects hard to justify investing in. Trump’s version of this policy, however, is particularly heinous. Under previous Republican administrations, this policy rescinded around $575 million, while Trump’s more strict policy has taken away an estimated $8.8 billion as it has been applied to funding support for family planning and reproductive health, maternal and child health, nutrition, HIV/AIDS—including The President’s Plan for Emergency Relief for AIDS (PEPFAR), prevention and treatment of tuberculosis, malaria (including the President’s Malaria Initiative), infectious diseases, neglected tropical diseases, and even to water, sanitation, and hygiene programs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe February 7th review of this policy in no way took into account the actual impact that it is having on women’s health around the world and instead focused solely on how effectively the policy has been implemented. As this policy has only been fully implemented for six months, many NGOs have not yet renewed their grants, so it’s likely that even more money will be denied to these institutions in the coming months.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo what do these impacts actually look like? If an NGO uses half of its funding for reproductive health and referrals for abortion but uses the other half for vaccinations, nutritional supplements and HIV/AIDS treatment, the group now has to choose between shutting down half of their programs or losing all of their US funding. Complications from pregnancy and childbirth are the second leading cause of death in the world for ages 15-19 and the World Health Organization estimates that at least 22,000 women die from abortion-related complications every year. Those rates will only get worse. The US provides nearly 50% of the world’s HIV/AIDS funding and this policy will impact the quality and availability of screenings and care.  Thousands of people now do not have access to care and Trump’s review doesn’t even take this into account because he doesn’t care about the lives of woman around the world. Hell, he doesn’t care about the lives of woman here. Until there’s another Democrat in office, this won’t be changing soon.\u003c/p\u003e",

I bought our three tickets and the show ended up selling out within minutes. If anything, this is a testament to the mainstream success that JOJI - real name George Miller and formerly Filthy Frank - and the rest of the 88 Rising, a collective of Asian artists, have attained.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"2378\" data-orig-height=\"1582\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/22d3c3531502ed01613905430dea1be5/tumblr_inline_pmhci0k49b1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"2378\" data-orig-height=\"1582\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eHonestly, I wasn’t sure what to expect the days leading up to the show. I knew who Filthy Frank was and I knew the types of fans he had. I had also heard stories of Joji coming on stage performing drunk with a red Solo cup in hand. Knowing this, I prepared myself for an intense concert experience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen our Uber dropped us off, I saw a sizable line wrapping around the El Rey. I was relieved to see that there was nobody wearing any pink guy suits or any other esoteric Filthy Frank related gear. We headed to the end of the line and waited outside for around 15-20 minutes before the doors opened and we began trickling in. As we walked in the staff handed us all electronic wristbands with the 88 Rising logo on them to be used later in the show.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3511\" data-orig-height=\"2636\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/63b25696f16ac6204b8a5f9c4aeb184d/tumblr_inline_pmhcialWi41qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3511\" data-orig-height=\"2636\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe opener was a small artist named Rei Brown. His set was chill; his lo-fi aesthetic and ethereal-sounding vocals reminded me of Joji. (I even overheard someone new to me say “Wait, I thought this was Joji”) His performance, however, wasn’t very dynamic and at times, a lot of his songs sort of melded together and sounded like a single song that lasted 30 minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe crowd became unengaged part of the way through Rei Brown’s set — you could hear a lot of talking and people were on their phones — but when Joji came on, the atmosphere completely changed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2171\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9d5afebe5d5f1842199436a58698ab78/tumblr_inline_pmhciubgWE1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3264\" data-orig-height=\"2171\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe opened with “Will He” and the audience immediately began screaming as soon as the song began. It seemed like everyone knew the lyrics and compared to the studio version, the live version was much more exciting. One thing I noticed was the Joji was so good live. A lot of times, his studio versions were very lo-fi and the vocals sounded a bit muddy. But that night, I just kept thinking that his singing was so much better in person.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome memorable moments were when he performed “Head in the Clouds” and his encore “Slow Dancing in the Dark”.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring “Head in the Clouds”, the wristbands we were initially given lit up in unison for the first time to accompany the song and the lights he had on stage. And honestly, even if it’s a bit cheesy, it really enhanced the concert experience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring his encore, he performed two versions of “Slow Dancing in the Dark”, first an acoustic version and the original version. Both were incredible and really ended the night on a high note.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, some of my favorite moments were those two, and also when he performed one of my favorite songs, “Yeah Right.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStill, I was left a bit unsatisfied; his set was only around 45 minutes, which is not very long at all. I felt like there could have been more but at the same time, his discography is not very expansive and the songs he does have are already quite short. I guess one good thing that comes from that is that the songs are easy to remember and most people can sing along to at least parts of all the song. Despite that, it was a really enjoyable experience; when my roommate and I got back to our room, we just sat there and listened to the entire album over again. In the end, seeing Joji live gave me a greater appreciation for him as an artist and especially as a singer.\u003c/p\u003e",

Once I saw the line that was wrapping around the venue I knew I’ve committed a crime. How could I possibly wear COLORS to a Good Charlotte show? This is just pure disrespect. The ONE day oh my god, I generally don’t even wear colors on a daily basis. I tried my hardest to not feel ashamed as I walked through the monochromatic crowd in my bright blue sweater, but the stares were definitely there. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter camping out at the boba place across the street for two whole hours waiting for the doors to open, I got to Will Call with the hope that I can just get a balcony ticket. Of course, I got floor instead. It was a very guilty wish to have for me, since Alt Rock is indeed my favorite genre and tonight I was going to see both Good Charlotte and Sleeping With Sirens; but at this point I’ve already gone through another lecture on top of my 8am major class (for reference I was supposed to have three but I just had to skip one or else it would’ve been inhumane towards myself), few more hours being stuck in the LA traffic, all using the non-existed fuel I’ve got from my 5 hours of sleep from the night before. I had my camera, a prism, a jacket and guess what\u0026ndash;a John Green book\u0026ndash;stuffed in my backpack. I really should be excited for this, I thought to myself, but in reality, I was just exhausted from weeks of hard work and the resulting breakdowns. This better be a good night, I needed it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis was one of those nights that had to start off early because there were just so many opening acts. The Dose and Knuckle Puck took the stage for a good hour. Although it was clear that most people came for the other two bands performing that night, the crowd was actively trying to pump up the spirit by being supportive and energetic. From screamo to pop rock, everyone was aware that the first two bands were just the pre-gaming for the night; but the quality of the performances had sure kept everyone’s interest. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5350\" data-orig-height=\"3567\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4e917ed958e7e4a0bd83f709fa75ce21/tumblr_inline_pm2pptI1Wi1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5350\" data-orig-height=\"3567\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause of how exhausted I was, I sat down behind the soundboard area in between different acts. Thus, I was completely oblivious of the flow of the crowd until the lights went off once again for Sleeping With Sirens. The size of the audience had at least doubled its size since Knuckle Puck had left the stage. Everyone was cheering and screaming nonsense off their lungs\u0026ndash;just how one would expect at a rock show. Shortly after, the long-awaited band went on with one of their classic numbers, “Do It Now Remember It Later”. I had very basic knowledge of Sleeping With Sirens prior to the show. Knowing that they are one of the most noticeable figures for the emo community, I always have massive respect for the band. Although their music is really not something I would casually listen to while I’m skateboarding to class, this performance they were putting on tonight was everything a rock fan could ever ask for. It was the first time in a good while where I felt like my beloved passion in photography was becoming a chore, all I wanted was to put my camera away and devote all my attention to the performance. From “Empire of Ashes” to “Congratulations”, the crowd and I gave our all. There’s something very unique to the genre of rock, no matter what the particular branch is, rock music never fails to make someone feel more alive. Of course, this wasn’t just any rock show, it was literally Sleeping With Sirens on stage opening up for Good Charlotte. I was mostly immersed in the atmosphere throughout the band’s 10-song set, but the speech on mental health made by the lead singer Kellin Quinn really stuck with me. He mentioned his own struggle with depression, and how even though he is the lead singer who was currently standing in front of a crowd performing, depression is something that can get to anybody. “This one is for all of you who’s struggling,” he said as the band latched onto “Better Off Dead”. I could only compare the crowd to Panic! At The Disco’s crowd during “Girls/Girls/Boys” and Fall Out Boy’s crowd during “Thnks fr th Mmrs”. It was obvious that this song was particularly special for both the band and its fanbase, that it carries a meaning connecting the artists and their supporters. When it comes to Emo and Rock bands, there is always the stigma attached to them saying that this is depression music and people who listen to Emo are a group of sad losers. But to me, it is moments like this that are able to prove that Rock only connects people and brings life back for them. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"4869\" data-orig-height=\"3246\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/619dd16ec84c650cbf646ec9b476cfba/tumblr_inline_pm2pskVcak1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4869\" data-orig-height=\"3246\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy this point, I’ve forgotten about how I was severely sleep deprived. Despite the fact that Sleeping With Sirens was potentially the best opening act one can ever get, Good Charlotte was extraordinarily legendary. Though the crowd at the Wiltern that night was huge, Joel Madden, the lead singer of Good Charlotte tried his best to sneak in as much conversation as possible. He went from talking about how the band started back when they were still teenagers and how many fans were probably listening to them back in middle school, to his perspectives on the political and social climate today. Specifically, Joel even talked about how many of their songs were written from a different time when things were different from today’s context. For example, even though the song “Girls \u0026amp; Boys” is obviously written as a satire in my perspective, the band still took their time to explain how the stereotypical and materialistic approach mentioned in the song is not valid in today’s society. It was obvious that these genuine talks brought the crowd closer and everyone was experiencing some kind of nostalgia in their own ways. For me, it was the song “Life Changes” that brought back the nostalgia for me. Despite the fact that my roommate and I really don’t have the most sentimental friendship, we have been friends for almost 6 years and have only gotten closer even with all the changes that had happened in our lives. Even though most members of different rock bands tend to keep their own lives private, most bands want their songs to be open for interpretations and want their fans to be able to relate to their life stories. With a band like Good Charlotte, everyone has their own journey with their music, and a night like this one serves to bring the pieces back. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"5472\" data-orig-height=\"3648\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/9dbe66f32058e420a75f09f8e50ada2a/tumblr_inline_pm2ptnW7Kz1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"5472\" data-orig-height=\"3648\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

Jenkins also rapped with a singer that only sang during certain songs. During the songs that were therapeutic to Jenkins, the accompanist barely sang; but, during songs that were made to, probably, please his record company, like Plain Clothes, they both dominated the stage equally.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, he performed songs from his 2014 mixtape The Waters, which I remembering discovering on Datpiff when I was a youngin.  Before performing, his most famous songs, “Jazz” and “Martyrs,” he talked about his self-growth since he made that mixtape, and thanked his fans for sticking and listening to him. Jenkins presented himself as an artist who sees his art as a collective reflection of himself, which he is able to communicate with an audience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePersonally, my favorite part of the concert was when he was so invested in rapping a song, like “Ghost,” that it felt like he forgot about the audience to entertain.  He just stood in place, as a singular man reflecting about his years and moments leading him up to the point of being able to perform on a sold-out stage.\u003c/p\u003e",

    "title": "On USSF’s Hiring Process // Sports",
    "content": "\u003ch2\u003eThere’s Hardly a Reason to Criticize the Berhalter Hire, But Many to Question USSF’s Hiring Process \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003earticle by Ben Hunter\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter being rumored as the frontrunner for the vacant USMNT job for last 14 months, former USMNT defender and current Columbus Crew boss Gregg Berhalter was announced as head coach by USSF on December 2. Berhalter played collegiately at UNC and then had a lengthy playing career in Europe, featuring for the likes of Crystal Palace, 1860 Munich, Energie Cottbus, as well as three Dutch sides. He became the first American to manage in Europe when he took over Hammarby in 2011. He was fired in 2013 and took over the Crew, where he has been since.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are several surface level reasons to criticize this hire; however, it is far more complex than the twitter warriors portray it to be. People say that he wasn’t that successful so far as a head coach and that his brother, Jay, is COO of US Soccer. It’s hard to determine the validity of this criticism for one simple reason: USSF’s hiring process had next to no transparency. It’s also hard to assign blame for this lack of transparency. Carlos Cordeiro wasn’t elected president until February, and Earnie Stewart didn’t begin his job as GM until August. This is the biggest issue from my perspective; Cordeiro and USSF needed to have a GM working sooner to finalize our head coach sooner. Bruce Arena resigned on October 13, 2017, and it made sense why we would wait to hire a head coach. Dave Sarachan could handle the job for a little while, and we could look to get a coach who may become available at the end of the club seasons or World Cup. This did not happen, and the top candidate from the list of American names was ultimately selected months later.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUSSF really dropped the ball during this hiring process, leading loads of unnecessary pressure being put on Berhalter. There was a 33 person shortlist, which was trimmed down to 11, and it’s unknown how many interviewed. The only two who are confirmed to have interviewed were Berhalter and Oscar Pareja, who just moved on from FC Dallas for Tijuana. It is rumored that there was a third candidate interviewed, but no one knows for sure. By not interviewing more candidates, USSF implies that Berhalter is such an incredible candidate that it’s not worth interviewing the likes of Peter Vermes, Tab Ramos, Jesse Marsch, Juan Carlos Osorio, or Julen Lopetegui (who reached out to the federation). Another name that I wish the federation reached out to is Arsene Wenger, since I think his play style would be perfect for developing our young attacking talent, but that’s a debate for another day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is clear as day that Jay Berhalter’s presence impacted the decision to hire his brother, no matter how much USSF insists he was not involved in the process. It’s not possible to think that a coach who did respectably—but by no means incredibly—as an MLS head coach is such a good candidate that hardly any others need to be interviewed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, USSF put even more unnecessary pressure on Berhalter by taking 14 months to find a new coach since the catastrophic failure to qualify. This is not his fault, but it adds even more scrutiny to his job. USSF makes it even more clear that he was the top candidate all along, as they waited for him to finish his MLS season. MLS shouldn’t take priority, period. There was a major wasted opportunity here because Berhalter should’ve been put in charge in August, so that he could prepare for the three fall international breaks. The USMNT had six friendlies, each of which was against a good team. It was good to see Sarachan playing the youngsters; however, it would’ve been even better if they were playing in the system that Berhalter wants to utilize in the foreseeable future. Also, veterans like Bradley and Altidore should’ve been re-integrated under the new coach, so that they could provide experience and mentorship to young guys, while they all adapted to a new coach and system. There are only about 10 international games per year, excluding summer tournaments, so I think the opportunity to have played 6 games against top-tier opposition would’ve been invaluable. From my perspective, the media is not talking about this opportunity that USSF wasted enough. It is especially confusing since the hiring process took so long, but its length doesn’t seem to be justified from what we know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite all of these questions and criticisms of the process, Berhalter may turn out to be an excellent hire. Actually, I think he is the right man for the job. I would’ve liked to have seen Peter Vermes considered, as I think his achievements at Sporting KC are very solid, and I wish we knew more of any foreign candidates considered. Overall though, I think it is good we hired an American. With our identity severely damaged, we needed someone who understands the US Soccer system and what it means to represent your nation in a sport that may not be on top, but is rising and has the power to influence people. Additionally, Christian Pulisic said he just wants someone who has a tangible plan on how to turn around the program. Berhalter will have a plan in mind without any doubt. He served as both head coach and technical director in Columbus, and he worked with a below-average budget, so having a plan was critical. His record may not be incredible with a 74-69-50 MLS record, but when you consider the market he worked in and the fact he made four playoff and one MLS Cup appearance, it is impressive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll things considered, Berhalter is a slightly lackluster but solid hire for USMNT head coach. Criticism has come from the media for the outlined reasons; some of it may be justified, but that doesn’t mean Berhalter doesn’t have what it takes to lead what will hopefully be a \u003cbr/\u003esuccessful USMNT period. He will certainly be prepared to coach this team in the upcoming cycle with a new plan and identity. All he has to do to silence the critics is one thing: win. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Latinx kids from Los Angeles are currently trying to create their own space in order to openly perform their identities and ideas in an oppressive society. The punk genre is a loud and fast-paced form of music that speaks about the failures of society. Classism, Sexism, and Racism are all issues that limit the growth of marginalized youth. This genre encourages rebellious youth movements against oppressive social norms and government institutions. The punk scene is a form of spatial entitlement and sonic space among Latinx youth trying to survive in Los Angeles. The rebellious aspect of the punk scene is shown through Latinx fashion; their style is considered as nonconforming. The dark “edgy” clothes worn by these youth is critical in giving the space meaning and allows the representation of Latinx punk identities. Conservative adults look down upon Punk Latinx groups because they look intimidating and problematic. However, interacting with these Latinx Punks and hearing their stories it reveals how empowered they are by claiming a space that is rarely inclusive towards their identity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe aggression and rebellion that is seen through Latinx Punk style is a product of marginalized kids’ creation of subcultures in order to help them survive discrimination and racism. Their styles showcase empowerment and unity among Latinx youth. They are able to separate themselves from mass culture to seek their own individuality. In the following photos, I will present some images from the OC Punk Fest of Latinx youth embodying the punk culture. At the fest, I asked them to introduce themselves, share their identities, and why the punk subculture is important to them. After hearing their stories, I learned that these Latinx punks are visionaries and want to present themselves through their fashion, ideas, and music. They are making an impact in today’s society by being themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"975\" data-orig-height=\"742\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/5e442364c09fb20f4e4ae5d192db1b66/tumblr_inline_pj6sle7hHa1qhakxc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"975\" data-orig-height=\"742\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eL\u003c/i\u003e\u003ci\u003eeft to Right: Jagger Age 16, Sydney Mendez Age 16, Rodrigo Hernandez Age 15, Daisy Gonzales Age 16, Andrew Hernandez Age 17 (Shot by Karina Jaramillo)\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eSidney Mendez:\u003c/b\u003e “My name is Sidney, I\u0026rsquo;m 16 years old.

And also it is a part of me and my style and who I am as a person.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eLeslie Mayorga: \u003c/b\u003e“My name is Leslie Mayorga I’m 19 years old and I’m from Los Angeles, I identify as Hispanic. My style varies a lot it’s usually lots of black 80s-esqué garments like dresses, trousers, blazers, etc. I love jewelry too! I’ve made earrings and stuff like that. I feel like the reason I like to dress the way I do has a lot to do with how I express myself and want to physically project myself to others, a lot of times people stare at me and mad dog me and I know the reason for that is because of how I look (dress, hairstyle, makeup) and in a way making people angry or uncomfortable in that sense can be liberating because it’s obvious that if someone feels threatened it’s because they are looking at something they don’t know or even bother to understand/respect and I find it kinda funny and kinda sad how people can be so judgmental. Part of it too is that I just love putting outfits together and adding little details.

My style is significant to me because it gives a satisfaction that I don’t look like everyone else and it gives me confidence.

He has the photo of him and his old friend and they\u0026rsquo;re both in heavy leather jackets and hightop Nikes; I thought it looked badass. Anyway, music wise I started off listening to Rage Against the Machine when I was 5 years old and from there  I built up a style, you know. My first punk bands were The Adolescents, Conflict, The Casualties, The Clash, and Circle Jerks. I always thought about the punk scene/music was revolutionary. The style itself was fucking everyone off right and it was an outcast thing. That\u0026rsquo;s goes with me. My parents didn\u0026rsquo;t let me dress myself under up to 5th grade and I would dress casual. At the age of 12 through 15, I was making my own shit(jeans, cut shirts and shit like that). I started attending backyard shows at 13 because my brother had this band, so therefore I was exposed to the Moreno valley punk/ska/indie. It was all mixed in from what I remember. Throughout high school I had my docs and patches I shaved my hair into a tri-hawk and would wear it up every day. My dad has beat me up because of the way I would dress and stuff. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t cool but it’s important because it shows the ones that want to see you \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;una pinche niña adolescente\u0026rdquo; like it’s a big FUCK”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"469\" data-orig-height=\"740\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/14c793dccd51fb0dbef8efa58d17e4a1/tumblr_inline_pj6smvCE121qhakxc_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"469\" data-orig-height=\"740\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eNathan Salazar Age 15 (Shot by Kelvin Cerezo)\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cb\u003eNathan Salazar:\u003c/b\u003e “My name is Nathan Salazar.  I am 15 years old and I’m from Long Beach, California.

I like to paint my nails black and wear docs and tuck in my shirt with cut sleeves and wear a bandana around my leg. I paint my nails and wear the bandana because I hate the fashion now and everyone looks the same and it bugs me. I just try to do the opposite like painting my nails to show that I don’t care that “painting your nails is for females. ” The scene is important to me for many reasons. I’m glad punk rock is still thriving because if it weren’t I would be one bored mf but also it gives me a reason just to go out and be with people I can call my friends because we all feel the same about things and how we think people on the outside are. I’m thankful for the scene because how it brings us together in every way not just through feeling but through the love for punk rock and without the scene I don’t even think I’ll have my own band, The Neurotics, and it encourages me and my band just go hard every time we play because we can’t look sorry. I love the people in it yeah everyone’s not perfect but the people I’ve met I’m thankful for that people are really humble.”\u003c/p\u003e",

The venue, alive with pulsing crowds of late teens and early 20-somethings, began popping off with part lofi, hip-hop, and poppy-esque artist Bohkeh’s set, followed by the dark, bassy beats of Holly, who set the pace for Great Dane, the last opener. Great Dane’s hip-hop inspired beats appropriately braced audiences for the headliner. He maintained the crowd’s anticipatory energy, even surprising them with a brief and well-received appearance from Mr. Carmack, an EDM staple.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3856\" data-orig-height=\"3744\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/1faf9aaf5738b1a664e2d9bd26b53aea/tumblr_inline_pivqk3fjf01qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3856\" data-orig-height=\"3744\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith a swagger palpable to everyone in the venue, Troyboi emerges onstage greeting the audience who accompanies him in the spelling of his stage name, his iconic trademark. Outside of the music, so many parts of Troyboi’s performance demonstrated the uniqueness he brings to EDM. During the beginning of his performance, breakdancers join him and impress the crowd with their gymnastic ability, never falling out of beat with the music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3744\" data-orig-height=\"5616\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/43a18ac9edd1a48bcc0ca3575570d706/tumblr_inline_pivqkhP33r1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3744\" data-orig-height=\"5616\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe surprises don’t stop there–during “B.I.A” and “X2C”, two acrobats suspend themselves above the DJ, rotating in a hula hoop, occasionally and gracefully shifting with changes in his songs’ texture, mesmerizing audiences even more than before. Later, he even brings out a violinist to play the intro of newly released “Laalach.” She shifts into dancer mode, twirling around billowing sheets of colorful fabric, joined by another dancer following suit. Finally, he features rapper Healthy Chill to fulfill his part in “Hooper,” a Troyboi classic, and Destiny, whose vocals accompany Troyboi’s latest single, “Frustrated.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3555\" data-orig-height=\"4109\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/6f7168ba563ea122d6fa4052887556c6/tumblr_inline_pivqkoSWj61qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3555\" data-orig-height=\"4109\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeyond his onstage guests, Troyboi also enhanced his performance with his epically trippy, silhouetting visuals. My favorites were during “Flamez,” where crisp footage of live flames and showering embers erupted and pulsed along with the music. Similar in sensory detail, he features visuals of water droplets during “Drip,” immersing the audience in the song in an intersection of the aural and visual. He also innovatively included an image of one of his songs’ SoundCloud profiles, which spastically glitched dynamically and vibrantly along the beat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3459\" data-orig-height=\"4320\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/c54bc04d52f4ee6877ccdd95b86390f6/tumblr_inline_pivql3rOs91qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3459\" data-orig-height=\"4320\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe show wrapped up seamlessly with “ili,” a legendary hit. The exhausted and blissful faces of crowd members trickling out of the venue indicated the show’s success. While Troyboi owes the world his signatory bouncy, hip-hop influences and his soul-infusing basslines, what’s for certain is that he’ll always have a welcoming home in LA.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"3939\" data-orig-height=\"2774\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/ae77365cb442a4ced8a592f580562b50/tumblr_inline_pivqlbqlf21qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"3939\" data-orig-height=\"2774\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e",

    "content": "\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003earticle by Anna Kondratyeva\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGus Dapperton is what 90s music would be if 90s music was stripped of its inherent nostalgia and thrust into a poppy, muted technicolor digital age. He rocks an ironic, very high bowl cut (you can DIY this if you use a very tiny bowl), jangly earrings, dad sweaters, and a Manic Panic catalog of hair dyes. His image evokes an aesthetic of social media angst, his Instagram consisting of him projecting sad boi hours while looking moodily out of his bed sheets. This makes him very appealing to young women who have pastel Instagram themes and are also occasionally sad, but then happy again because Gus Dapperton’s music is goddamn cathartic. Go on and hurt me, men. Gus is proof that you can take your heartbreak, mix it with urban ennui, and combine it to make creative genius. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause life is hard and unpredictable (“and I’m to blame for but once or more”, as Gus would say), my photographer flaked on me three hours before the show was to start, leaving me to utilize the only effective social network at my disposal, which, sadly, happens to be Tinder. I weeded my small army of matches for those who put ‘photographer’ in their bio (in LA, almost everyone), then ranked them in order of their expressed interest. The most non-threatening 20 received a calculated damsel-in-distress message, promising a free concert ticket and a fun\u0026mdash;so fun! ;) \u0026mdash;night. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3002\" data-orig-width=\"4657\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/390db2cb17996c49be436887236e35cd/tumblr_inline_phy3gsrfAx1qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3002\" data-orig-width=\"4657\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is how I came to the show, filled with my-shared-Lyft-is-taking-an-hour-to-travel-4-miles neurotic energy, and waiting for someone who was willing to utilize expensive equipment to go to a last-minute concert with a stranger. After meeting up with my date the first thing that happened is that his backpack was searched and his (apparently expensive) bottle of tequila was angrily thrown out by security. I wanted to convince my date that I was sure Mr. Dapperton personally would not mind the tequila, but he was in mourning and I let him grieve. Gus Dapperton was delayed gratification; the prize for our patiently listening to an artist that nobody really knew before the legend himself appeared. I could feel a hundred hopeful female hearts flutter and fall as the opener, Beshken, came on stage, wearing an entire outfit of crumpled white linen and laden with a mess of electronic equipment. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeshken was\u0026hellip;a character. We spent a good 30 minutes trying to figure out what drugs he was on, as well as calculate the constantly changing rhythm by which he thrashed his head up and down. The best way I can describe his music is as experimental lo-fi electro-rock, his atmospheric beats complemented by the bass guitar he would randomly pick up and riff on most of the show consisted of him moving sliders up and down on his sound mixer with great concentration and occasionally making indulgent eye contact with the audience, creating a strange sense of his sensory isolation on stage. This aura was punctuated with sporadic interjections of “LA, what the fuck is up” before subsequent retreats back into spasmodic head nodding. In the end, after surviving 15 minutes of seizure-inducing strobe lights (and a succeeding headache), I can’t say I was happy to see Beshken leave the stage, but definitely a little relieved. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter milling around for 30 minutes and bonding over our collective music tastes, my date and I began to respect each other as more than means to achieve our separate goals. The air was taut with anticipation for our stylistic icon and emotional role model, creating a spirit of conviviality that resonated warmly under the venue’s crystal chandeliers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"tmblr-full\" data-orig-height=\"3012\" data-orig-width=\"4800\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/687fcc7046230053cc90531ddd43657e/tumblr_inline_phy3qiqvc61qhakxc_540.jpg\" data-orig-height=\"3012\" data-orig-width=\"4800\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e When Gus came on, a wave of nervous energy crescendoed and spilled into the auditorium, with him and his backup musicians appearing like the ghosts of a coolness long past. Dapperton’s aesthetic embodies androgynous fashion\u0026mdash;a post-modern toga-like shirt, plaid culottes (during a pause between songs, a fan screamed out “I love your pants!”), and his iconic bright hair dye (bleach-blonde). To my surprise, he sounded even better on stage\u0026mdash;every sound was so much more amplified, so much more vibrant and colorful and resounding. Even though Gus Dapperton only has about 10 songs currently on Spotify, this worked in his favor; everyone in the audience knew everyone song and was consistently, appropriately hyped. There were points in which he invited the audience to dance because “well, we will be dancing here on stage,” and everyone did, moving their bodies to his crooning, head-nodding rhythms of nostalgia and longing love. Hugging my Tinder date, I realized that it’s been a while since I’ve been to a concert where I so genuinely connected the other people in the audience. I loved the three aging bearded men in front of me wearing Def Metal t-shirts and excitedly holding up their phones to Snapchat Gus; I loved the couples swaying together to their favorite songs and kissing quietly as the choruses came on. As I watched my date take photos with his old-fashioned film camera, capturing the light falling in rainbow petals on the crowd, I felt all the tenderness that pulses through Dapperton’s music like a heartbeat. Every song was like an individual moment in an individual rose-tinted universe, simultaneously both cheerful and wistful. After an encore (the band played a revitalized version of “Twist and Shout”), and an intense crowd-surfing session, in which our old friend Beshken reappeared like a crumpled white ghost, the instruments were packed and our spirit of love for humanity was released into the red velvet carpeting of El Rey. I walked out feeling elated, holding hands with my date and looking soulfully into his eyes, attempting to preserve in them the happiness that the music had granted us for the night. All I have to say: if you take anything out of a Gus Dapperton concert, it’s an appreciation the tiny little miracles that happen to bring humans closer together.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Walking to the back of the line, I passed Tom Misch fans of all ages- high schoolers, college students, middle-aged adults, and some families. As I stood in front of the stage, waiting for the opening act, I briefly spoke to a mother who was attending the concert with her daughter. They were excited to see Tom Misch live, and mentioned to me that they’ve both been listening to him since the release of his newest album, \u003ci\u003eGeography\u003c/i\u003e.

The crowd began to grow restless as we waited, and someone from his team informed me that they were running an hour being schedule. When the opener arrived on-stage, he unexpectedly began to play lo-fi hip-hop beats. While I wasn’t a frequent listener of this type of music, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed his beats and the atmosphere he created. The crowd moved to his beats, singing and dancing along when he mixed popular songs. After a few songs, he brought out his saxophone, and the crowd was mesmerized by the flow of the classic jazz instrument mixed with his heavy hip-hop beats.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"4272\" data-orig-height=\"2848\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/b8ef8acc85f3d132fee02d13ce38ac00/tumblr_inline_phl2o21FWa1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4272\" data-orig-height=\"2848\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the opener left and Tom Misch took the stage, the ambiance of the venue was transformed. He first performed a lively song off of his newest album, \u003ci\u003eGeography\u003c/i\u003e, bringing up the energy of the crowd. Due to the intimacy of the small venue, he was able to connect with the crowd and set a perfect scene for his music. When he performed one of my personal favorite songs, “Movie,” I felt the softness and familiar tone of the song that I feel when playing it through headphones. When he performed “Lost in Paris,” the emotions in the crowd were elevated and the energy of the venue felt vibrant. He brought his opener back to the stage to play the saxophone, adding more depth and a familiar jazz tone to his music. The crowd was mesmerized by the pairing of Misch’s electric guitar with the saxophone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure data-orig-width=\"4272\" data-orig-height=\"2848\" class=\"tmblr-full\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/284fbfb30b13965bd2f78f9ec2dd77c3/tumblr_inline_phl2o9DVGR1qhakxc_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"4272\" data-orig-height=\"2848\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen he thanked the crowd and wrapped up the show, the electrified audience began chanting for an encore.

He asked the crowd for a selfie before leaving the stage for the last time. The crowd was lively after the show, on a high after Tom Misch’s captivating performance. The feelings he was able to evoke with his live music made it undeniably one of the best performances I have experienced.\u003c/p\u003e",
