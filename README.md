All of the code that powers [uclaradio.com](https://uclaradio.com).

UCLA Radio is a Javascript application, powered by
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and utilizing the
[Express.js](http://expressjs.com) framework. We use
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) for our database and
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) on the front-end.

In addition to the visible site, we also have a [RESTful
API](https://github.com/uclaradio/uclaradio/wiki/The-API), which powers an
internal panel for managers and DJs as well as our
[iOS](https://github.com/uclaradio/uclaradio-iOS) and
[Android](https://github.com/uclaradio/uclaradio-Android) apps.

UCLA Radio is a completely student-run organization offering cultural content
created by 100+ DJs. [Let us know](mailto:radio.web@media.ucla.edu) if you have
any suggestions! All of the software here is written by students.

## Getting Started

### Running

#### Development

##### Windows

1. Install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org).
2. Install git by running `choco install git --params="'/GitAndUnixToolsOnPath /NoAutoCrlf'" -y`.
3. Install [CMDer](http://cmder.net) with `choco install cmder -y`.
4. Install [cairo](https://www.cairographics.org), which is a dependency for a
   package we use. You can do this by downloading Glade (which is a program that
   installs cairo as a dependency) [here](http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net).
5. Open CMDer and clone our repo by running the command `git clone https://github.com/uclaradio/uclaradio.git`. While you wait for it download,
   give us some love by starring our repo.
6. Open Powershell as an administrator and cd to the `uclaradio` repo you just
   cloned. Run our
   [`setup1.ps1`](https://github.com/uclaradio/uclaradio/blob/master/scripts/setup1.ps1)
   script. If you're getting a "running scripts is disabled error", try running
   `set-executionpolicy remotesigned`.
7. Open up **another** Powershell window as an administrator and run the
   [`setup2.ps1`](https://github.com/uclaradio/uclaradio/blob/master/scripts/setup2.ps1)
   script. Why two scripts? Windows is weird, man.
8. Run mongo with `mongod`.
9. Run `yarn dev` to start the server for development.
10. Point your browser to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)

##### MacOS

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).
2. Install git by running `brew install git` or by installing Xcode command line
   tools (which includes git) with `xcode-select --install`.
3. Clone our repo by running the command `git clone https://github.com/uclaradio/uclaradio.git`. While you wait for it download,
   give us some love by starring our repo.
4. Navigate to the `scripts` directory and run our
   [`setup.sh`](https://github.com/uclaradio/uclaradio/blob/master/scripts/setup.sh)
   script.
   - Wondering what this does? Basically it installs the latest versions of
     [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com), and
     [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), then uses these programs to install the
     packages we use and set up a local database.
   - If you have a problem that looks like
     `error: unknown type name 'uint64_t' uint64_t ri_user_time;`
     Check out this page [`https://github.com/cython/cython/issues/2009`] and do what matkam says.
5. Run mongo with `mongod`.
6. Run `yarn dev` to start the server for development.
7. Point your browser to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)

###### Blog Development

8. Download the categorized blogposts file, which contains all the old tumblr posts. You'll need access from the codeowners.
9. Run `yarn fill-blog-db` to seed the database with the downloaded JSON file.
10. In another terminal, run `mongo` to enter the mongo shell.
11. Once in the shell, switch to the appropriate database `use uclaradio`.
12. Validate that you just added 734 blogposts `db.blogposts.count()`.

#### Production

- Make sure all packages are installed with `yarn`.
- Run `node bin/www prod` to start the server for production (will require HTTPS
  and listen on port 80).

### Requirements for new code

As a student-run organization, UCLA Radio is especially liable to technical
debt. We have some goals for cleaning up our codebase in the future, but most
importantly new code should:

- Have new front-end pages in **React**. We prefer using a front-end framework
  with an API to complicated templates.
- Delete files that are not used anymore. It's okay, get rid of clutter.
- Follow an organized structure. Put things in the right directories.

We accept changes from both radio web members and outside contributors. Please
note both our [contributing guidelines](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [code of
conduct](/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before making a pull request. Want to join
radio? We [accept
applications](http://apply.uclastudentmedia.com/applications/ucla-radio/web-staff/)
every quarter.
