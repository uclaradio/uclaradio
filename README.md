All of the code that powers [uclaradio.com](https://uclaradio.com).

UCLA Radio is a Javascript application, powered by [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and utilizing the [Express.js](http://expressjs.com) framework. We use [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) for our database and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) on the front-end.

In addition to the visible site, we also have a [RESTful API](https://github.com/uclaradio/uclaradio/wiki/The-API), which powers an internal panel for managers and DJs as well as our [iOS](https://github.com/uclaradio/uclaradio-iOS) and [Android](https://github.com/uclaradio/uclaradio-Android) apps.

UCLA Radio is a completely student-run organization offering cultural content created by 100+ DJs. [Let us know](mailto:radio.web@media.ucla.edu) if you have any suggestions! All of the software here is written by students.

## Getting Started
### Running
#### Development
##### Windows
1. Install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org).
2. Install git by running `choco install git --params="'/GitAndUnixToolsOnPath /NoAutoCrlf'" -y`.
3. Install [CMDer](http://cmder.net) with `choco install cmder -y`.
4. Install [cairo](https://www.cairographics.org), which is a dependency for a package we use. You can do this by downloading Glade (which is a program that installs cairo as a dependency) [here](http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net).
5. Open CMDer and clone our repo by running the command `git clone https://github.com/uclaradio/uclaradio.git`. While you wait for it download, give us some love by starring our repo.
6. Open Powershell as an administrator and cd to the `uclaradio` repo you just cloned. Run our [`setup1.ps1`](https://github.com/uclaradio/uclaradio/blob/master/scripts/setup1.ps1) script. If you're getting a "running scripts is disabled error", try running `set-executionpolicy remotesigned`.
7. Open up __another__ Powershell window as an administrator and run the [`setup2.ps1`](https://github.com/uclaradio/uclaradio/blob/master/scripts/setup2.ps1) script. Why two scripts? Windows is weird, man.
7. Run mongo with `mongod`.
8. Run `yarn dev` to start the server for development.
9. Point your browser to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) :heart_eyes:

##### MacOS
1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).
2. Install git by running `brew install git` or by installing Xcode command line tools (which includes git) with `xcode-select --install`.
3. Clone our repo by running the command `git clone https://github.com/uclaradio/uclaradio.git`. While you wait for it download, give us some love by starring our repo.
4. Run our [`setup.sh`](https://github.com/uclaradio/uclaradio/blob/master/scripts/setup.sh) script.
    - Wondering what this does? Basically it installs the latest versions of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com), and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), then uses these programs to install the packages we use and set up a local database.
5. Run mongo with `mongod`.
6. Run `yarn dev` to start the server for development.
7. Point your browser to [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) :heart_eyes:

#### Production
- Make sure all packages are installed with `yarn`.
- Run `node bin/www prod` to start the server for production (will require HTTPS and listen on port 80).

### Requirements for new code

As a student-run organization, UCLA Radio is especially liable to technical debt. We have some goals for cleaning up our codebase in the future, but most importantly new code should:
* Have new front-end pages in **React**. We prefer using a front-end framework with an API to complicated templates.
* Delete files that are not used anymore. It's okay, get rid of clutter.
* Follow an organized structure. Put things in the right directories.

We accept changes from both radio web members and outside contributors. Please note our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/uclaradio/uclaradio/wiki/Contributing-Guidelines). Want to join radio? We [accept applications](http://apply.uclastudentmedia.com/applications/ucla-radio/web-staff/) every quarter.
